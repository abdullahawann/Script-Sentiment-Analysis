darcy is joined by bingley exhilarated by the dance come darcy i must have you dance i hate to see you standing by yourself in this stupid manner shake his head you know how i detest it upon my word ive never seen so many pretty girl in my life you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but her sister elizabeth is very agreeable they have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have not seen elizabeth and charlotte who are standing close behind them elizabeth smirk a she overhears their conversation perfectly tolerable i dare say but not handsome enough to tempt me elizabeth smile drop you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smile for you are wasting your time with me bingley go off elizabeth and charlotte who have overheard darcy and bingleys exchange ignore him lizzie he is such a disagreeable man it would be a misfortune to be liked by him dont worry i would not dance with him for half of derbyshire

bennet and darcy your friend miss lucas is a most amusing young woman yes i adore her it is a pity she is not more handsome mama but lizzie will never admit she is plain of course it my jane who considered the beauty of the county oh mama please when she wa only fifteen there wa a gentleman so much in love with her that i wa sure he would make her an offer however he did write her some very pretty verse and so ended their affection i wonder who first discovered the power of poetry in driving away love i thought that poetry wa the food of love of a fine stout love it may everything nourishes what is strong already but if it is only a thin slight sort of inclination im convinced that one good sonnet will starve it away entirely darcy look at elizabeth with surprise a glimmering of interest so what do you recommend to encourage affection oh dancing of course even if one partner is barely tolerable she give him a dazzling smile darcy look startled he ha no idea she heard him he blush elizabeth is dancing happily in a round jane and bingley are also in the same dance at the edge of the dance floor darcy is watching elizabeth and jane are both tucked up in the same bed but are too excited to sleep mr bingley is just what a young man ought to be sensible good humoured completing the list handsome conveniently rich you know perfectly well i do not believe marriage should be driven by thought of money i agree entirely only the deepest love will persuade me into matrimony which is why i will end up an old maid do you really believe he liked me lizzie jane he danced with you most of the night i wa flattered i must admit i did not expect such a compliment that is one great difference between u compliment always take you by surprise well mr bingley is certainly very amiable and i give you leave to like him youve liked many a stupider person lizzie youre a great deal too apt to like people in general you know all the world is good and agreeable in your eye not his friend i still can not believe what he said about you mr darcy i could more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine but no matter i doubt we shall ever speak again she blow out the candle mr bennet presides over breakfast with an endless description of the ball mary is doing some needle work whilst lydia kitty and jane blearily eat and then he danced the third with miss lucas poor thing it is a shame she is not more handsome the fourth with a miss king of little standing and the fifth again with jane if hed had any compassion for me he would have sprained his ankle in the first dance oh mr bennet anybody would think the girl looked forward to a grand inheritance elizabeth roll her eye at mr bennet theyve heard this speech many time before kitty be so kind a to pas the butter a you

horizon she stop to take it in then carry on down an even more muddy track in the large grand dining room caroline bingley and darcy are eating breakfast it very formal in fact frigid compared to the volatile bennet household darcy is reading the newspaper caroline bingley is reading a letter put down the letter apparently lady bathurst is redecorating her ballroom in the french style a little unpatriotic dont you think mr darcy is about to answer when the door open a footman appears his face rigid with disapproval miss elizabeth bennet lizzie come in her face flushed her skirt covered in

bingley pace about anxiously caroline berates him from the sofa stay she is a perfectly sweet girl but save being an excellent walker there is very little to recommend her i thought she showed remarkable spirit coming all this way the eldest miss bennet a you know i hold in excessive regard and i wish her well settled though i do fear with her family low connection there is little chance of it their uncle is in trade you know in cheapside if they had uncle enough to fill all cheapside it would not make them one jot le agreeable mr bennet is overseeing the gardener who is pruning the hedge mr bennet bustle up she look very pleased with herself well my dear it all going according to plan he half in love with her already a touch disingenuously who my sweetest mr bingley and he doesnt mind that she hasnt a penny for he ha enough for the two of them suddenly a distant trumpet sound dog bark the militia are arriving lydia and kitty rush past they are dressed up to the nine to greet the officer mr bennet face light up wait for me and shes gone mr bennet gaze at their departing figure mr bennet and her two daughter rush down the street into the village dog bark child run

panting behind them lydia deliberately drop her hankerchief one of the soldier stand on it she is appalled elizabeth is reading a book darcy is writing a letter bingley is sat nervously caroline obviously bored wanders the room looking for distraction she look over darcys shoulder you write uncommonly fast mr darcy without looking up you are mistaken i write rather slowly caroline bingley lingers annoyingly how many letter you must have occasion to write mr darcy letter of business too how odious i should think them it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours please tell your sister that i long to see her i have already told her once by your desire lizzie look across from her book i do dote on her i wa quite in rapture at her beautiful little design for a table perhaps you will give me leave to defer your rapture till i write again at present i have not enough room to do them justice mr bingley now pacing anxiously around the room it amazing how young lady have the patience to be so accomplished what do you mean charles they all paint table and embroider cushion and play the piano i never heard of a young lady but people say she is accomplished the word is indeed applied too liberally i can not boast of knowing more than half a dozen woman in all my acquaintance that are truely accomplished nor i to be sure goodness you must comprehend a great deal in the idea i do absolutely she must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern language to deserve the word and something in her air and manner of walking and of course she must improve her mind by extensive reading elizabeth close her book i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished woman i rather wonder now at your knowing any are you so severe on your own sex i never saw such a woman she would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold pause darcy go back to his letter caroline bingley pick up a book pause put it down she walk over to miss bennet let u take a turn about the room lizzie surprised get up caroline bingley link her arm and they start walking up and down it refreshing is it not after sitting so long in one attitude and it a small kind of accomplishment i suppose darcy meet lizzies eye briefly he go back to his letterwriting more walking up and down caroline bingley turn to darcy mr darcy will you join u shake his head you can only have two motif miss bingley and i would interfere with either to lizzie archly what can he mean our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it please tell u either you are in each others confidence and have secret affair to discus or you are conscious that your figure appear to the greatest advantage by walking if the first i should get in your way if the second i can admire you much better from here oh shocking how shall we punish him for such a speech we could always tease him oh no mr darcy is not to be laughed at are you too proud mr darcy and would you consider that a fault that i couldnt say for were trying to find a fault in you maybe it that i find it hard to forgive the folly and vice of others or their offence against myself my good opinion once lost is lost forever oh dear i can not tease you about that what a shame for i dearly love to laugh a family trait i think elizabeth smile sweetly miss bingley glance at darcy elizabeth wake up next to jane darcy gallop through the countryside darcy exhausted ride into the stable yard in the corner is a trough and pump he stride up to the pump put his head under it and douses himself with cold water from a window elizabeth look out at darcy darcy look up and for a second catch elizabeth looking down at him she turn from the window jane is waking up jane do you think you might feel well

introduced to caroline bingley and darcy elizabeth hold her breath a her mother launch into untold gaucherie what an excellent room you have sir such expensive furnishing i hope you intend to stay here mr bingley absolutely i find the country very diverting dont you agree darcy i find it perfectly adequate even if society is a little le varied than in town but i assure you there is quite a much going on in the country a there is in the town indeed mania i think mr darcy merely meant there were not such a variety of people to be met in the country a there are in town which you must acknowledge to be true nonsense we dine with four and twenty family sir william lucas for instance is a very agreeable man so very genteel and easy elizabeth cringes mr bingley is it true that you have promised to hold a ball here at netherfield well it would be an excellent way to meet new friend you could invite the militia oh do hold a ball trying to stop bingley being kitty when your sister ha recovered you shall name the day i think a ball is a perfectly irrational way to gain new acquaintance it would be better if conversation instead of dancing were the order of the day indeed much more rational but rather le like a ball thank you mary to mr bennet please let me show you to jane you will find her quite recovered the bennet carriage awaits the bingleys are gathered to see the bennet off jane is radiant in the peak of health to the bingleys really i dont know how to thank you bingley beam bashfully he cant take his eye off her really youre welcome anytime you feel the least bit poorly thank you for such stimulating company it ha been most instructive not at all the pleasure is all mine elizabeth look at darcy who doe not say anything she get in the carriage mr darcy miss bennet they share a look a elizabeth join the rest of the bennet in the carriage the driver take off bingley wave enthusiastically to jane goodbye goodbye the family are all squeezed in rather too tightly what a high and mighty man that mr darcy is quite eaten up with pride the bennet carriage is stopped in it track by the militia who are marching en masse through town lydia can not believe her eye a row after row of soldier pas by the carriage with not a few of the men looking in at the bennet girl with some interest i cant believe it there must be a thousand of them leading the one troupe of militia is wickham a very handsome blonde officer lydia spot him and swoon to the coachman please drive on a the bennet girl come into the house lydia eulogizing the militia they meet mr bennet i hope my dear that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party mr bennet hold up the letter collins late twenty an overweening sychophant nervous and unctuous in equal measure he sits in his black garb hunched uncomfortably a he come through town dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late father over the entail to me of the longbourn estate ha long been a subject of much torment which i have frequently wished to heal having received ordination this easter and being so fortunately distinguished by the patronage of the right honorable lady catherine de bourgh collins voice fade out a his carriage wipe through frame revealing elizabeth and charlotte on their way to the butcher his name is mr collins he the dreaded cousin who to inherit indeed everything apparently he may leave u our stay but even my piano stool belongs to mr collins when he can turn u out of the house a soon a he plea but why because the estate is entailed to him and not to u poor female a cart pass crammed with sheep going to slaughter mr collins is ushered in by the manservant perkins he look around his future home with interest mr and mr bennet greet him mr collins at your service what a charming house so convenient for the local village look at the furniture and some very fine piece if im not mistaken a beat this is hardly tactful they are jane lizzie and mary enter ah these are your daughter are they not we have some more somewhere i must congratulate you i have heard much of their beauty but in this instance fame ha fallen short of the truth a very low bow the girl are somewhat taken aback the bennet and collins are seated formally for supper mr collins is served some food what a superbly featured room and what excellent boiled potato it is many year since i had such an exemplary vegetable to which of my fair cousin should i compliment the excellence of the cooking mr collins we are perfectly able to keep a cook excellent i am very pleased the estate affords such a living i am honoured to have a my patroness lady catherine de bourg you have heard of her i presume mr bennet shake her head my small rectory abuts her estate rosings park and she often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and pony a pause lizzie catch her father eye doe she have any family one daughter the heiress of rosings and very extensive property i have often observed to lady catherine that her daughter seemed born to be a duchess for she ha all the superior grace of elevated rank mr collins contd these are the kind of little delicate compliment that are always acceptable to lady and which i conceive myself particularly bound to pay how happy for you mr collins to posse the talent for flattering with delicacy mr collins nod with satisfaction do these pleasing attention proceed from the impulse of the moment or are they the result of previous study jane kick elizabeth under the table elizabeth try not to laugh at mr collins answer they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with arranging such little elegant compliment i always wish to give them a unstudied an air a possible believe me no one would suspect your manner to be practised the girl look at one another after dinner i thought i might read to you all an hour or two i have with me fordyces sermon which speak eloquently on this point do you know fordyces sermon miss bennet later we can see the girl and mr bennet gathered by the fire through the doorway mr collins leaf the room and take mr bennet aside to a very discrete conference out of hearing of anyone else mr bennet you do know i have been bestowed by the good grace of lady catherine de bough a parsonage of no mean size i have become aware of the fact well itis my avowed hope that soon i may find a mistress for it and i have to inform you that the eldest miss bennet ha captured my special attention collins look lasciviously into the room mr collins unfortunately it is incumbent on me to hint that the eldest miss bennet is very soon to be engaged engaged but miss elizabeth next to her in both age and beauty would make anyone an excellent partner do not you agree mr collins mr collins look through the doorway at elizabeth indeed indeed a very agreeable alternative elizabeth and jane are walking towards the house when across the moat they see mr collins come out of the house and advance towards them oh no mx collins spot them and dart through a door in the garden wall and hurry towards the bridge to meet them quick this way she pull jane across the duck board spanning the moat through the house and out the front mr collins double back and follows them into the house the girl are nowhere to be seen he look around puzzled elizabeth and jane arrive in the village jane forever the dutiful daughter look uneasy elizabeth is flushed and reckless she look behind them weve lost him they slow down to a walk and then stop outside the milliner shop the incorrigible lydia and kitty are chatting to wickham the dashing young officer we spotted earlier he is utterly gorgeous slim handsome tousled hair the perfect romantic hero kitty lydia she and jane join them we just happened to be looking for some ribbon didnt we kitty and we met mr wickham he picked up lydia glove he a lieutenant wickham bow im enchanted shall we all look at some ribbon together oh yes they come into the shop the others go towards the counter wickham hang back and smile a complicit witty smile at elizabeth she colour though i must warn you i have very poor taste only a man truly confident of himself would admit that no it true my room in town decorated i thought in the height of fashion have reduced grown men to tear of mirth then why dont you change them and deny people such pleasure so you dont mind being laughed at not particularly it is a somewhat sterile quality is it not to be aware of one importance in the world especially if like me one ha none elizabeth look at him with interest a beat the moment is broken by lydia coming up lizzie please lend me some money you already owe me a considerable sum liddy allow me to oblige no please mr wickham wickham give elizabeth a smile and move away to the counter the girl emerge from the shop with wickham youre too generous i know fivepence halfpenny it all add up ill pay him back oh yes ill make sure of that they laugh elizabeth is really rather taken with him they walk down the street will you be stationed here all winter mr wickham that depends on what the french have in mind of course i look forward to action smile at her but on the other hand lizzie look they stop janes face light up mr bingley it is indeed bingley riding towards them he is accompanied by darcy bingley jump off his horse and hurry over to jane his open friendly face is filled with delight i wa on my way to your house please mr bingley when are you going to give a ball lydia i wa just waiting until your sister wa quite well she is elizabeth pay no attention to the following conversation instead she is looking at darcy who in turn is staring at wickham they both obviously recognize each other and look very uncomfortable when then a soon a they have made the white soup be sure to invite mr wickham darcy turn and ride off without a word lydia you cant just say that will you excuse me lady mr wickham enjoy the day elizabeth look at wickham puzzled a small card party is underway three table have been set up elizabeth wickham jane lydia kitty charlotte and sir william and lady lucas are present a small number of officer and other lady are also present we move around the table kitty is sat with sir william and charlotte and mary jane sits at a table with mr collins and lady lucas lizzie sits with lydia and two other officer lydia flirt outrageously we have asked mama if we might have new dress for the netherfield ball yes white they must be white white is the only colour to be worn this season so i believe mr collins is at a table with lady lucas he glance over at elizabeth a he talk of course when you understand that lady catherine de bourgh is it proprietor you will realise what an immense compliment that is lady catherine spent eight hundred pound on a chimneypiece alone wickham who ha been talking to some of the other officer come and sits beside elizabeth passing by mr collins on the way aside to elizabeth your cousin is blessed with an uncommon capacity for charm elizabeth laugh and play a hand will you be attending the netherfield ball mr wickham i hope to how long ha mr darcy been a guest a netherfield elizabeth pounce on this reference to mr darcy and take her chance about a month are you acquainted with mr darcy indeed my fate ha been very intimate with that gentleman i have been connected with his family since infancy elizabeth is genuinely surprised there is a pause while she is forced to play her hand you may well be surprised miss bennet especially given the cold manner of our intimacy this afternoon are you well acquainted with that gentleman a much a i could ever wish to be i have spent four day in the same house a him and i think him very disagreeable i can not pretend to be sorry elizabeth blush but really i speak out of turn collins voice break the moment miss elizabeth i wa just saying to sir william what appalling weather weve been having elizabeth can not believe her misfortune in mr collins but she smile politely i think i shall take a little air she rise and walk through the room towards a balcony a she pass the other table we follow and witness snippet of their conversation it seems mr wickham ha met with universal approval though lizzie look singularly pleased with him at the moment she ha more suitor than sense charlotte look over at mr collins elizabeth pass sir williams side of the table now any one for a round of bridge elizabeth really i need to take some air mr collins make his way to join elizabeth mr collins oh i am not so familiar with the game sir william absolute nonsense i insist that you join u please mr collins id be happy if youd collins resigns himself to his fate elizabeth smile and slip out into the night air elizabeth breathes in the cold night air she sens someone join her she look round to see wickham ha followed her a she had hoped i hope your plan in favor of meryton will not be affected by your difficult relation with the gentleman we were just speaking of oh no it is not for me to be driven away if he wish to avoid seeing me he must go not i pause i must ask you mr wickham what is the manner of your disapproval of mr darcy do you really want to hear lizzie nod he ruined me she stare at him how so my father managed his estate we grew up together darcy and i his father treated me like a second son oh he wa the kindest of men and bequeathed me the best living in his gift for i had my heart set on joining the church but when he died darcy ignored his wish and gave the living to another man why did he do that out of jealousy for his father loved me more than he loved him how cruel are you sure and out of pride for he considered me too lowly to be worth his consideration pause lizzie gaze at him with horror and sympathy we pan through the bedroom a the bennet girl prepare for the netherfield ball kitty is helping lydia into her dress they are both wearing white aggghh breathe in we move to the quieter preparation of jane and elizabeth this conversation ha been going on for some time i still think there must have been a misunderstanding oh jane do you never think ill of anybody how could mr darcy do such a thing i will discover the truth from mr bingley at the ball this evening if it is not true let mr darcy contradict it himself but until he doe i hope never to encounter him poor unfortunate mr wickham on the contrary he is twice the man darcy is and let hope for you a rather more willing dancer jane leaf elizabeth at the mirror taking very particular care of her makeup she to herself the great door of netherfield open to reveal the ball in full swing compared to the somewhat clodhopping assembly it a dazzling affair there are hundred of guest all the woman roughly two hundred are dressed in white the men are either in red officer uniform or dressed in black and white there are a number of room each occupied by a different activity card buffet woman closet the final and grandest room is the ball room a swirl of elegant dance the bennet enter the first reception room the girl including mr bennet are all dressed in white mr collins is slightly detained a people pas mr bingley bound up to jane youre here im so pleased and so am i how are you miss elizabeth elizabeth is not paying attention instead she is searching over mr bingleys shoulder for a sight of wickham are you looking for someone no no not at all admiring the splendor of the ball it is lovely mr bingley bingley and jane move off leaving elizabeth with mr bennet and others while mr bennet talk we focus on elizabeth searching the sea of red coat refering to jane and i dare say i have never met a more pleasant gentleman in all my year look how he dotes on her still jane ha always done what is best for her family elizabeth take this opportunity to slip away into the next room elizabeth look around but can not see mr wickham suddenly she think she see him so start to a r move over the man turn round it is not wickham but someone else elizabeth walk nonchanantly into the next room again looking for mr wickham she crane around trying to see him then she is suddenly surprised by charlotte lucas have you seen mr wickham she shake her head perhaps he is in the ballroom they both walk into the ball room we pull back to reveal a sea of dancer wickham is nowhere to be seen jane appears and catch elizabeth arm he not here apparently otherwise detained the disappointment is palpable on elizabeth face detained mr collins arrives breathless he smile eagerly at elizabeth there you are mr collins what a pleasant surprise perhaps you will do me the honour miss elizabeth oh i didnt think you danced mr collins i do not consider it incompatible with the office of a clergyman to indulge in such an innocent diversion elizabeth try to smile politely in fact several people her ladyship included have complimented me on my lightness of foot elizabeth face is a matey rictus they dance the style of which is not unlike english country dancing to be sure dancing is of little consequence to me but it doe afford the opportunity to lavishones partner with delicate attention which is my primary object of the evening elizabeth turn a part of the dance and for a moment she dance beside jane apparently your mr wickham ha been called on some business to town though my informer told me he would have been le inclined to be engaged had it not been for the presence at netherfield of a certain gentleman jane indicates towards where darcy stand watching them that gentleman barely warrant the name the dance lead elizabeth back to mr collins it is my intention if i may be so bold to remain close to you throughout the evening couple are preparing for the next dance elizabeth and charlotte are standing to one side when mr darcy approach may i have the next dance miss elizabeth elizabeth is stunned you may darcy walk away what wa i thinking have i no presence of mindl i dare say you will find him very agreeable lizzie heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate elizabeth dance face to face with darcy neither can speak they dance for a moment in silence i do love a sarabande indeed most invigorating they continue for a moment in silence it is your turn to say something mr darcy i talked about the dance now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couple i am perfectly happy to oblige please advise me of what you would like most to hear that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private ball are much pleasanter than public one but for now we may be silent do you talk a a rule while dancing we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb so a little lubrication to avoid embarrassment might be advantageous i see no striking resemblance of your own character in this how near it is to mine i can not say beat tell me do you and your sister very often walk to meryton they are suddenly parted by the choreography of the dance we stay with elizabeth who is whisked round the floor by an elderly man who smile at her toothlessly elizabeth look back at darcy who is dancing with lydia he stare at elizabeth a he dance elizabeth smile at her current partner in embarrassment very mild weather weve been having deaf a a post sorry the dance spin again and she is back with darcy yes we often walk to meryton it is a great opportunity to meet new people in fact when you met u we had just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance i will admit your mr wickham is blessed with such happy manner a may ensure his making friend whether he is capable of retaining them is le certain he ha been so unlucky a to lose your friendship i remember hearing you once say that your resentment once created wa unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose a to it being created i am may i ask to what these question tend to make out your character mr darcy and what have you discovered very little the dancefinishes i hear such different account of you a puzzle me exceedingly i hope to afford you more clarity in the future they bow to each other and elizabeth move quickly away from darcy elizabeth is at the buffet watching kitty quaff a huge glass of wine and having the glass immediately refilled she is joined by caroline bingley who also look at kitty disapprovingly miss elizabeth let me recommend you a a friend not to give too much confidence to all of the assertion your friend mr wickham might make he is indeed a charming man but one should never forget from where he is descended his lack of trustworthiness and descent appear by your account to be the same thing please excuse my interterence it wa kindly meant a breathless mr collins appears is that mr darcy of pemberley in derbyshire i believe so but i must make myself known to him immediately but sir he is the nephew of my esteemed patroness lady catherine he is mr collins start making his way determinedly towards darcy please mr collins hell consider it an elizabeth watch from a distance with acute embarrassment a collins interrupt darcy darcy doe not notice him so collins raise his voice mr darcy the room around him stop darcy is surprised and turn round in dumbshow we see darcy is horrified by collins obsequiousness during the conversation collins point elizabeth out to darcy what interesting relative you have miss bennet elizabeth walk away into another room the other room where mary is singing badly at the piano elizabeth is horrified she turn to leave only to see mr bennet looking on he wince a mary miss a high note mary finish the song with an off key flourish polite applause mary smile and prepares for another song arent you going to do something mr bennet walk over to the piano mary dear youve delighted u long enough but they asked for another song mr bennet shuts the lid let the other young lady have a turn later charlotte and lizzie are sat together perhaps my family have made a competition to see who can expose themselves to the most ridicule well at least bingley ha not noticed they look over and see jane and bingley dancing bingley clearly besotted by jane yes i think he like her very much but doe she like him there are few of u who are secure enough to be really in love without proper encouragement bingley like her enormously but might not do more if she doe not help him on she is just shy and modest if he doe not perceive her regard he is a fool we are all fool in love he doe not know her character a we do she should move fast snap him up there is plenty of time for u to get to know them after were married elizabeth look over the dancefloor to see lydia dancing with a soldier shes a little drunk and very flirtatious he say something she shriek with laughter elizabeth sits at the side of the dancefloor she look at mr bennet dancing in outrageous fashion cut to later lydia is getting more and more leery with a group of soldier elizabeth walk away in embarrasment only to see mr collins smiling at her from across the room cut to elizabeth dancing joylessly with the excruciating mr collins a she turn in the dance she see darcy look on with obvious disdain cut to much later the band are exhausted guest are leaving the staff are asleep on their foot elizabeth almost alone watching her parent dancing almost the only people left on the dance floor kitty is asleep over elizabeth lap this is a never ending nightmare day light creep through the curtain mr bennet is sprawled on a sofa lydia completely drunk kitty asleep jane sitting demurely collins looking longingly at elizabeth mr bennet is holding court whilst the footman behind are literally ready to drop bingley is standing the perfect host but obviously willing the bennet to leave i have never had such a good time in my life mr bingley you must have such a ball once a month at least caroline who is standing with her brother yawn ostentatiously mother i really think it is time to go dont be impertinent our host are perfectly happy with our company are you not mr bingley i hope i can entice you to longbourn to sample our hospitality we would make sure you had or course at least she hold out her glass for a top up and carry on so tell me mr bingley whom did you like least of all your guest this evening really this is enough darcy looking down at elizabeth from a staircase he turn and walk away the bennet are squeezed into their carriage it is light outside only mr bennet is awake but the lack of an audience doe not stop her from talking allowing for new carriage dress etcetera etcetera we will be having a wedding here at netherfield in le than three month if you ask me mr bennet mr bennet int breakfast room longbourne day the bennet eat in silence janeyawns mr bennet moan she is hungover mr collins come in in a state of agitation they look at him he sits hesitates then is mr collins mr bennet i wa hoping if it would not trouble you that i might solicit a private audience with miss elizabeth in the course of the morning elizabeth is open mouthed oh yes certainly lizzy would be very happy indeed please go ahead no time like the present everyone out mr collins would like a private audience with your sister everyone look in amazement wait i beg you mr collins can have nothing to say to methat anybody need not hear no nonsense lizzy i desire youwill stay where you are everyone else to the drawing room mr bennet but now mr bennet make sure everyone leaf wink at mr collins then shuts the door before elizabeth ha time to do anything elizabeth look at mr collins who look at her in earnest there is a horrible pause of intense embarrassment dear miss elizabeth you can hardly doubt the purpose of my discourse my attention have been too marked to be mistaken almost a soon a i entered the house i singled you out a the companion of my future life elizabeth stare at him astonished but before i am run away with my feeling perhaps i may state my reason for marrying firstly that it is the duty of a clergyman to set the example of matrimony in his parish mr collins contd secondly that i am convinced it will add greatly to my happiness and thirdly that it is at the urging of my esteemed patroness lady catherine that i select a wife we here a kick and kitty screach from behind the door sshhh my object in coming to longbourn wa to choose such a one from amongst mr bennet daughter for a you know i am next in the entail of the estate and such an alliance will surely make amends for this drop to his knee and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection mr collins and that no reproach on the subject of fortune will cross my lip once we are married you are too hasty sir you forget that i have made no answer i must add that lady catherine will thoroughly approve when i speak to her of your modesty economy and other amiable quality sir i am honoured by your proposal but regret i must decline it momentarily taken aback but i know lady have their pretty little way and dont seek to seem too eager in some desperation mr collins i am perfectly serious you could not make me happy and im convinced im the last woman in the world who could make you happy i flatter myself cousin that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy besides you should take into account that despite your manifold attraction it is by no mean certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made to you rising deeply affronted mr collins so i must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant female sir i am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man please understand me i can not accept you elizabeth storm out of the room and out of the house mr bennet crash in through another door hot on the tail of elizabeth declined indeed the headstrong foolish thank you but head strong we shall have this little hiccup dealt with immediately mr collins mr bennet go chase after elizabeth mr collins watch through a window a elizabeth is chased by her mother mr bennet march into the library mr bennet look up in shock oh mr bennet we are all in a uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vow she will not have him mr bennet starter at mr bennet blankley mr collins mr collins ha proposed to lizzie but lizzy declares she will not have him and now the danger is mr collins may not have lizzy and what am i to do mr bennet drag mr bennet to his foot speak to lizzy they march to find elizabeth mr bennet and mr bennet confront elizabeth who ha been waiting in the hallway perhaps the other girl form an audience from the stair mr collins look on sheepishly from the breakfast room tell her that you insist upon them marrying papa please you will have this house i cant marry him youll save your sister from destitution i cant go back now and say youve changed your mind no think of your family you cant make me mr bennet say something so your mother insists on you marrying mr collins yes or i shall never see her again well lizzie from this day on you must be a stranger to one of your parent who will maintain you when your father is dead your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do thank you papa elizabeth turn around and walk into the drawing room elizabeth enters the drawing room in the drawing room mary is trying to read through the family din jane sits very still her face is white there a letter in her hand mr bennet charge in lydia and kitty in tow and speaks to anyone who will listen oh ungrateful child i shall

jabber on but her voice fade were with jane re reading the letter whats wrong jane close on janes pale face shes staring at the letter but it is always so those who complain are never pitied bingley caroline and darcy sit grimly in a carriage which drive off darcy look severe and stern caroline cant help a little smirk on her face bingley look back longingly elizabeth and jane in bed i dont understand what would take him from netherfield why would he not know when he wa to return i have no reserve from you jane pass elizabeth the letter mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and we are scarcely le eager to meet her again i really do not think georgina darcy ha her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishment so much so i must hope to hereafter call her my sister it is my duty to indulge you in no hope in this respect for your own self is that not clear enough miss bingley see that her brother is in love with you and is gone with him to persuade him otherwise but i know her to be incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone he love you jane do not give up go to our aunt and uncle in london let it be known you are there and i am sure he will come to you jane is in a carriage mr bennet kiss her goodbye through the window a all the bennet look on give my love to my sister and try not to be so much of a burden dear janes carriage move away and the family wave mr bennet talk to elizabeth poor jane however a girl like to be crossed in love now and then it give her something to think of and a sort of distinction among her companion im sure that will cheer her uppapa it your turn now lizzie since youve turned down mr collins youre free to go off and be jilted yourself what about mr wickham he is a pleasant fellow and would do the job credibly thank you but a le agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect janes good fortune still it a comfort to know that whatever might befall you you have an affectionate mother who will be sure to make the most of it a small smile from elizabeth elizabeth is making the bed and tidying janes belonging there is a knock at the door and charlotte enters my dear elizabeth ive come here to tell you the news what news mr collins

home and considering mr collins character and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is a fair a most people can hope for and thats all you expect for woman in our situation what choice is there dont speak like that charlotte to become an old maid at best tolerated at worst a burden dependent on the kindness of others or to seek the protection of marriage and we only have two choice yes an appalled silence elizabeth gaze at her closest friend charlotte ha recovered herself she now look cool and composed unnervingly so you can still change your mind charlotte shake her head im twentyseven year old we hear the sound of the militia drum the militia are leaving meryton hundred of soldier and officer in the red coat marching out of the village to the sound of pipe and drum the villager are out to bid them farewell lydia and kitty run through the crowd very distraught they find elizabeth coming in the other direction it too dreadful theyre leaving for

you elizabeth charlotte and mr collins walk hurriedly across the lawn towards the great house beyond the toparied hedge the grey building loom ominously above them it is grand without being elegant one of the most extraordinary sight in all europe is it not the glazing alone cost upwards of twenty thousand pound mr collins charlotte and elizabeth are led up a vast stairway which is painted with vision of hell elizabeth stop in front of a painting of a devil she stare at it it seem to speak but she realizes the voice is collins chiding her a the devil this way the salon at rosings is spectacularly grand hideously so heavy furniture row of servant the three guest are shown in by the footman again mr collins scrape the floor with his bow your ladyship to the daughter miss de bourg lady catherine is a haughty bossy woman pretty unspeakable really her daughter is a sickly irritable looking creature so you are elizabeth bennet i am your ladyship looking her up and down hmm indicates her daughter this is my daughter it very kind of you to ask u to dine lady catherine lady catherine ignores her whisper to lizzie the chimneypiece alone cost but lizzie doesnt hear darcy

gratefully they move towards the dining room mr collins lean towards lizzie you know mr darcy is a good a engaged to miss de bourg really miss bingley will be disappointed to hear that look at the girl and whisper to charlotte what a sickly cross little thing oh yes they should suit each other very well charlotte smile back a little fearfully shes more intimidated by rosings than elizabeth is and indeed ha more at stake int dining room rosings night f the dining room is laid for a very grand dinner footman waiting thousand of candle lady catherine seat herself at the head of the table the guest wait for their order you sit there and you sit there mr collins you cant sit next to your wife after some awkward shuffling around they all sit down lizzie much to her discomfort find herself

fortunate enough no lizzie look at him he colour slightly lady catherine address lizzie in a loud voice from the head of the table do you play the pianoforte miss bennet a little maam and very poorly oh do you draw no not at all your sister do they draw not one that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of the master my mother would have no objection but my father hate london ha your governess left you we never had a governess mr collins squirm in embarrassment darcy watch elizabeth keenly no governess five daughter brought up at home without a governess i never heard such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education cant help smiling at this not at all lady catherine mmmm are any of your younger sister out yes maam all all what five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger one out before the elder are married your youngest sister must be very young yes my youngest is not sixteen but i think it would be very hard on younger sister not to have their share of amusement because the elder is still unmarried and to be kept back on such a motive it would hardly encourage sisterly affection upon my word you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age with three younger sister grown up your ladyship can hardly expect me to own to it lady catherine look astonished mr collins shift in his seat mr darcy glance sharply in fact admiringly at lizzie shes enjoying herself dinner is over and they are drinking coffee darcy move towards elizabeth but lady catherine interrupt by shouting from her seat come miss bennet and play for u no i beg you for music is my delight in fact there are few people in england who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient so would anne if her health would have allowed her please i told you i play poorly come come elizabeth her ladyship demand it lizzie reluctantly sits down at the piano and start to play lady catherine take no notice and talk loudly over the music how doe georgina get along darcy she play very well i hope she practises no excellence can be acquired without constant practice i have told mr collins this turn to charlotte though you have no instrument of your own you are very welcome to come to rosings and play on the piano in the housekeeper room thank you your ladyship you would be in nobody way you know in that part of the house darcy flinch at her bad manner he move away to the piano where lizzie is playing not that terribly well it must be said a moment pass you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all your state to hear me but i wont be alarmed even though your sister doe play so well i am well enough acquainted with you miss bennet to know i can not alarm you even should i wish it a beat they eye each other warily colonel fitzwilliam join them what wa my friend like in hertfordshire you really care to know the colonel nod prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time i saw him at the assembly he danced with nobody at all even though gentleman were scarce and there wa more than one young lady who wa sitting down without a partner i knew nobody beyond my own party true and nobody can be introduced in a ballroom fitzwilliam come here and talk to u fitzwilliam move away darcy and elizabeth are alone i do not have the talent of conversing easily with people i have never met before maybe you should take your aunt advice and practice ouch darcy flinch lizzie turn away from him and carry on playing darcy gaze at the curve of her neck she play a false note stumble and grimly carry on elizabeth is writing a letter in the drawing room she start dear jane the doorbell ring in the background she think nothing of it and continues the maid open the door to the drawing room and mr darcy enters mr darcy an awkward pause please do be seated im afraid mr and mr collins are gone on business to the village a pause what on earth doe mr darcy want he pace up and down this is a charming house i believe my aunt did a great deal to it when mr collins first arrived i believe so and she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful another pause mr collins seems very fortunate in his choice of wife he is indeed lucky to have found one of the few sensible woman who would have accepted him darcy sits down shall i call for some tea no thankyou the sound of the front door and voice darcy jump up good day miss bennet it been a pleasure he bow to her and leaf elizabeth sits there bemused and intrigued charlotte in the hallway taking off her bonnet darcy hurry past her with a swift bow and leaf abruptly charlotte gaze after him in surprise charlotte head to the drawing room where she find elizabeth sitting bemused what on earth have you done to poor mr darcy i have no idea she truly doesnt charlotte give elizabeth a look sunday service is over and worshipper are leaving the church mr collins in his vestment obeises himself to lady catherine who is sweeping out with her miserable looking daughter and downtrodden governess elizabeth join colonel fitzwilliam they walk down the path together how long do you plan to stay in kent colonel a long a darcy chooses i am at his disposal i do imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly to have someone to order around i wonder he doe not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind she would be a lucky woman really darcy is a most loyal companion from what i heard on our journey here he recently came to the rescue of one of his friend just in time darcy waylaid by various people come out of the church his eye search for elizabeth he see her with fitzwilliam and hesitates too late mr collins step up to him and engages him in conversation elizabeth stop at the churchyard gate what happened he saved the man from an imprudent marriage who wa the man his closest friend mr bingley a silence did mr darcy give you his reason for this interference there were apparently strong objection to the lady what kind of objection her lack of fortune i think it wa her family that wa considered unsuitable so he separated them i believe so i know nothing else elizabeth grows pale she turn to look at darcy who is joined by his aunt i wish mr darcy and all his friend well in finding partner suitable to their very high standard good morning col fitzwilliam elizabeth see that collins are still busy with their parishioner and slip away darcy see her from a distance lizzie walk across the park anywhere she hardly care she is in a turmoil of misery and fury how could darcy do such a terrible thing it start to rain a grecian summer house by the lake the rain is now bucketing down lizzie hurry into the summer house and sits down heavily on a bench her poor sister lizzie gaze in despair at the rain lashed landscape a man approach across the park he draw nearer it darcy elizabeth stiffens he hurrying towards her sodden breathless he come into the summer house he is in a state of agitation far too agitated to notice her upset face miss bennet i have struggled in vain but i can bear it no longer the past month have been a torment he pause unable to speak elizabeth stare at him in astonishment he struggle on i came to rosings with the single object of seeing youi had to see you me ive fought against my better judgement my family expectation the inferiority of your birth my rank and circumstance all those thing but im willing to put them aside and ask you to end my agony i dont understand i love you most ardently elizabeth stare at him please do me the honour of accepting my hand a silence elizabeth struggle with the most painful confusion of feeling finally she recovers sir i appreciate the struggle you have been through and i am very sorry to have caused you pain believe me it wa unconsciously done a silence gathering her shawl she get to her foot is this your reply yes sir are you laughing at me no are you rejecting me im sure that the feeling which a youve told me have hindered your regard will help you in overcoming it a terrible silence a this sink in neither of them can move at last darcy speaks he is very pale might i ask why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus repulsed trembling with emotion i might a well enquire why with so evident a design of insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your better judgement if i wa uncivil that wa some excuse believe me i didnt mean but i have other reason you know i have what reason do you think that anything might tempt me to accept the man who ha ruined perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister silence darcy look a if he been struck across the face do you deny it mr darcy that you separated a young couple who loved each other exposing your friend to the censure of the world for caprice and my sister to it derision for disappointed hope and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind i do not deny it how could you do it because i believed your sister indifferent to him indifferent i watched them most carefully and realized his attachment wa much deeper than hers thats because shes shy bingley too is modest and wa persuaded that she didnt feel strongly for him because you suggested it i did it for his own good my sister hardly show her true feeling to me pause take a breath i suppose you suspect that his fortune had some bearing on the matter no i wouldnt do your sister the dishonour though it wa suggested what wa it wa made perfectly clear thatan advantageous marriage did my sister give that impression no an awkward pause there wa however i have to admit the matter of your family our want of connection mr bingley didnt vex himself about that no it wa more than that how sir pause very uncomfortable it pain me to say this but it wa the lack of propriety shown by your mother your three younger sister even on occasion your father forgive me lizzie blush he ha hit home darcy pace up and down you and your sister i must exclude from this darcy stop and gaze at her he is in turmoil elizabeth glare at him in a blaze of fury and misery and what about mr wickham mr wickham what excuse can you give for your behavior to him you take an eager interest in that gentleman concern he told me of his misfortune oh yes his misfortune have been very great indeed you have ruined his chance and yet treat him with sarcasm so this is your opinion of me thank you for explaining so fully perhaps these offence might have been overlooked if your pride had not been hurt my pride by my honesty in admitting scruple about our relationship could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstance and those are the word of a gentleman from the first moment i met you your arrogance and conceit your selfish distain of the feeling of others made me realize that you were the last man in the world i could ever be prevailed upon to marry darcy recoil a if slapped a terrible silence forgive me madam for taking up so much of your time

the table behind her elizabeth doe not turn but watch him through the mirror im not going to renew the sentiment which were so disgusting to you but to address the two offense you have laid against me i had not long been in hertfordshire before i saw that bingley preferred your eldest sister i observed my friend behaviour attentively and i could perceive that his partiality for miss bennet wa beyond what i have ever witnessed in him elizabeth can not bring herself to look at darcy she stare at her own reflection a he speaks yet when i observed your sister detected no symptom of peculiar regard and witnessed only the family coarse appetite for having their daughter married favorably and so in london perhaps erroneously i persuaded him of the unfitness of the match citing your sister coolness towards him we zoom in on elizabeth reflection it wa unknowingly done and though the motif which governed me may to you appear naturally insufficient they were done to protect a friend a to the other more serious matter a elizabeth turn she realises darcy ha gone darcys voice carry my father provided for mr wickham a valuable living elizabeth tear open the envelope her hand shaking and read the letter a darcys voice carry on but upon his death however mr wickham told me that he had no intention of taking order and would i recompense him to the tune of so he could go to town and study the law we circle elizabeth a she read this i did though by now i had some doubt about his character these were confirmed by report that he had sunk into a life of idleness gambling and dissipation the money wa soon used up whereupon he wrote demanding more money which i refused whereupon he severed all holding the letter she look out of the window to see darcy riding away but last summer he wa unwillingly obtruded on my notice when he connived a relationship with my sister whom he persuaded to be in love with him and made her consent to an elopement she wa but fifteen darcy ride off mr wickhams prime objective wa her inheritance of thirty thousand pound but hope of revenging me wa a strong inducement i wa lucky enough to persuade my sister of her folly i hope this go someway to mitigating my behaviour in your eye if you doubt my word please have it confirmed by my cousin fitzwilliam elizabeth with the letter charlotte walk in elizabeth is shaking lizzy are you alright i do not know i hardly know myself elizabeth look at charlotte utterly shaken elizabeth riding in a carriage through cheapside reading the letter p a we shall never meet again i wish you all

elizabeth coat from her how fortunate you are here just in time to catch everybody coming through from longbourn how is jane mr gardiner smile sadly she is outside through a window elizabeth see jane sitting quietly alone at her needle work elizabeth and jane sit together in the small walled garden jane is all smile but behind her eye is a sadness unseen before elizabeth is desperate to unburden herself but feel unable i am quite over him lizzie if he passed in the street i would hardly notice london is so diverting oh jane it true what with the theatre and but tell me what news from kent nothing everything a you might imagine elizabeth try to smile there is a crash a all the bennet arrive at the house kitty rush into the garden cry her eye out she is followed by lydia and mr bennet lizzie tell mama tell her mr forster ha invited me why didnt she ask me a well kitty whats happened because she like me better ive just a much right a lydia oh if i could but go to brighton and more

wail from kitty im sure i cried for two day when colonel millars regiment went away thought i should have broke my heart mother are you all mad she glare at them deeply upset by them by everything elizabeth ha found a quiet corner with her father please papa dont let her go lydia will never be easy till she ha exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little inconvenience a under the present circumstance with great emotion if you dear father will not take the trouble to check her she will be fixed forever a the silliest and most determined flirt who ever made her family ridiculous and kitty will follow a she always doe we shall have no peace until she go really angry now peace is that all you care about colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is far too poor to be an object of prey to anyone father it dangerous im sure the officer will find woman better worth their while let u hope in fact that her stay in brighton will teach her her own insignificance at any rate she can hardly grow any worse without authorizing u to lock her up for the rest of her life elizabeth gaze at her father will nothing touch him he gave up on his daughter long ago for this just now she hate him no wonder our family is treated with contempt she leaf tear stinging her eye her father look puzzled at her outburst mr bennet follows elizabeth in well at least the house will be quieter i dont wish to be stuck with such a foolish family any longer with your constant talk of men and marriage surely there is more to life lizzie dear you would be very welcome to accompany u oh yes we plan to journey through the peak district youd be most welcome oh the glory of nature what are men compared to rock and mountain believe me men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity and if theyre amiable theyre so easily led that they have no mind of their own whatsoever take care my love that savour strongly of bitterness no they bring nothing but heartache a usual elizabeth and jane share a bed they lie next to each other in the darkness i saw mr darcy when i wa in rosings why did you not tell me did he mention mr bingley pause no he did not elizabeth ha never felt more alone in the company of her sister a ravishing landscape of savage and romantic beauty scudding cloud mountain wild rocky outcrop elizabeth is walking freely the wind in her hair a she nears the peak of a promontory mr and mr gardiner are below making their way towards her they smile at her she stride off determined to reach the very top when she get there she stand with her arm outstretched her head back laughing into the wind the view is magnificent she breathes deeply an establishing shot of lambton a charming market town through the window of an inn we see elizabeth and mr and mr gardiner at a table in the inn the gardiner and elizabeth are eating supper an air of high spirit at the next table another amiable tourist

breathtakingly beautiful set in great boulderstrewn park land a mansion built of golden stone glowing in the sunlight elizabeth walk through the magnificent ground imagine being mistress of all this it is a big a all cheapside elizabeth is lost in admiration elizabeth and the gardiner are being taken on the tour by the housekeeper mr reynolds who witters on in the background with description of each room elizabeth is apart and we witness the exquisite house from her point of view a book lie open on a reading desk elizabeth turn it over to read the title keep up they walk through room after amazing room a breath taking library an unbelievable staircase the huge picture gallery elizabeth is apart from the rest looking at the picture she stop by a painting of darcy she look at it

sunlight the view of the garden and valley beyond is exquisite outside the music we heard before is louder elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace being unconsciously drawn by the music suddenly elizabeth recognizes the tune perhaps it is one she ha played earlier but this time it is played exquisitely she follows the music round a corner intrigued a she get closer and closer to it source she finally realizes she is outside the room where the music is being played she steal herself a moment but her curiosity get the better of her and she discretely peep in through the window she see georgina darcy a beautiful fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and fluency she is moved by the music and listens after sometime then someone step into her view but is mostly hidden by shadow in the room he is directly behind georgina and gently put his hand over her eye georgina stop playing and laugh uproariougly she stand and kiss the figure the sunlight hit his face it

now jane and bingley are alone facing each other with extreme embarrassment miss bennet you have been the victim of a huge misunderstanding suffice to say i have been an unmitigated and comprehensive as and therefore i would like to ask you mr bennet kitty mary and mr bennet are all jostling for a position at the door in order to overhear event inside ssssshhh elizabeth is apart from her family she can not bear to be there she walk down the corridor and out of the house into the garden through a window she see bingley on one knee her eye fill with tear a she walk away from the house bingley look at jane desperately worried a pause yes a hundred time yes mr bennet and the girl throw open the double door to the drawing room and come crashing in bingley and jane beam at them thank the lord for that i thought it would never happen elizabeth is sat under a tree cry darcy look down at longbourn mr bennet and mr bennet are in bed i am sure they will do well together their temper are much alike they will be cheated assiduously by their servant and be so generous with the rest they will always exceed their income exceed their income he ha five thousand a year i knew she could not be so beautiful for nothing the camera move through to another bedroom where mary is reading a book out loud to kitty then to yet another jane and elizabeth lie in bed he ha made me so happy you know he wa totally ignorant of my being in town last spring how did he account for it he thought me indifferent unfathomable no doubt poisoned by his pernicious sister bravo that is the most unforgiving speech youve ever made oh lizzie if i could but see you so happy if there were such another man for you there is a noise outside perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time what is that more noise it sound like a carriage then a loud banging on the door downstairs the girl look at each other mr bennet mr bennet and the girl lit by only candle have gathered the door bang again maybe he changed his mind timidly mr bennet open the door revealing a wideeyed lady catherine de bourgh everyone gasp lady catherine lady catherine doe not acknowledge her but come in uninvited inspecting the assembled company of aghast bennet to mr bennet and these are your daughter i suppose all but one the youngest ha been lately married your ladyship and my eldest wa only proposed to yesterday afternoon you have a very small garden madam i am sure it is nothing compared to rosings but it is larger than sir william lucas i can assure you could i offer you a cup of tea perhaps absolutely not i must speak to miss elizabeth alone a a matter of complete urgency the bennet all look at each other bewildered by this strange turn of event elizabeth lead the way into the drawing room light an oil lamp lady catherine walk in the door close behind them you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand why i amhere lit only by the oil lamp lady catherine resembles a flickering ghoul indeed you are mistaken i can not account for this honour at all miss bennet i warn you i am not to be trifled with a report of a most alarming nature ha reached me that you intend to be united with my nephew mr darcy elizabeth stare at her amazed i know this to be a scandalous falsehood though not wishing to injure him by supposing it possible i instantly set off to make my sentiment known if you believed it impossible i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far to hear it contradicted miss bennet your coming here will be rather a confirmation surely if indeed such a report exists if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ha it not been industriously circulated by yourself i have never heard of it and can you declare there is no foundation for it i do not pretend to posse equal frankness with your ladyship you may ask the question which i may not choose to answer this is not to be borne ha my nephew made you an offer of marriage your ladyship declared it to be impossible let

revision a quieter tune just piano soft and tender and melancholy a melody we and mia instantly recognize it mia and sebastians song mia look at sebastian he look at her then back at his key this is the most beautiful weve ever heard his playing the most tender and full of emotion it ha ever sounded we move closer on sebastian we recognize this image it recall the visualization of his dream back at the restaurant that night in winter year ago gradually a sebastian play his surroundings seem to grow darker slowly subtly at first with just shift in lighting then a shift in perspective the interior of the club change and we find ourselves back at that same restaurant back when mia laid eye on sebastian for the first time within this fantasyflashback sebastian finish his piece we stick on mia watching him a his bos talk to him all is a before a we remember it and sure enough mia approach sebastian a he walk near her and i just wanted to say i saw your playing and i but instead of brushing past her sebastian deck her with a kiss for the age a burst of orchestral music the diner in the restaurant spin around to face mia and sebastian and snap their finger in time even the bos

covered bungalow and the ivydecked lamp the jacaranda tree and the giant hill and griffith and the santa monica pier all painted all prop all figment of a studio backdrop imagination weve entered a fully fantastical realm the realm of the old hollywood ballet of the and everyone dance the pedestrian and the street performer and the cop and the guard amy brandt race up to mia seems to beckon her to audition we see the audition silhouetted against a wall we dont hear mia sing but the music take on the melody of her song carrying u paris sebastian travel there with mia we chart the journey through an old globe the same one we saw mia use for her play a miniature plane and dissolve the old hollywoodmovie way finally we find ourselves looking at a painted backdrop of paris the same one mia used for her play the sacrcoeur and the arc de triomphe and the eiffel tower etched in bright color the ornate lamppost and the cobblestone stretching before u and then a sign caveau de la we see a jam session at the caveau a cryptlike jazz club sebastian play on cloud we see a movie shoot mia surrounded by light and crane decked in moviemovie glow were back to the caveau the light go out except for the trumpeter playing out a lovelorn solo rimlit we move in close on his horn dive into the bell and emerge into nighttime paris all painted mia and sebastian wander through this wonderland pedestrian frozen around them finally they stop and look at one another and a the city light behind them start to glitter like all the star of the galaxy they dance revision this is the last time well ever see them dance and they seem to recognize that so graceful and poised are their movement remember this is a romance more perfect than a real romance could ever be we dissolve again to a projector beam footage play on a screen full of scratch and pocket of light mia and sebastian sit down to watch together and we see the following moment in brief vivid glimpse a we move in closer on the the first home mias pregnancy the newborn child the child first birthday the child first day of preschool all dressed up everything here glow with the warmth of old home movie these are memory fluttering by grabbed at random and yet all concocted dreamed up out of nothing the score continuing to sway and taking u right up sebastian and mia husband and wife father and mother hiring a babysitter because

like sebastians club they sit down to listen and then and this is how our imagined montagemusical number end the combo pianist who of course is not sebastian launch into mia and sebastians melody and mia and sebastian look at each other recognizing it the music go fullcircle back to where it started a mia and sebastian look into each others eye lean in and softly but with all the love in the world

sebastian he look at her their eye lock a hint of a tear in both and ever so subtly for just a fleeting second mia smile it the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked but it enough to signal to sebastian that she recognized the melody he played and that she still remembers it and still think of it to this day then she walk out the door sebastian glance at his fellow musician then he nod and they launch into a new chart it silent outside you cant hear the music mia and david reach their car they get in it pull out passing by sebastians club the car continues on we stay put the jazz club

hayworth and shawshank redemption by stephen king a dark empty room the door burst open a man and woman enter drunk and giggling horny a hell no sooner is the door shut than theyre all over each other ripping at clothes pawing at flesh mouth locked together he grope for a lamp try to turn it on knock it over instead hell with it he got more urgent thing to do like getting her blouse open and his hand on her breast she arch moaning fumbling with his fly he slam her against the wall ripping her skirt we hear fabric tear he enters her right then and there roughly up against the wall she cry out hitting her head against the wall but not caring grinding against him clawing his back shivering with the sensation running through her he carry her across the room with her leg wrapped around him they fall onto the bed camera pull back exiting through the window traveling smoothly outside to reveal the bungalow remote in a wooded area the lover cry spilling into the night and we drift down a wooded path the sound of rutting passion growing fainter mingling now with the night sound of cricket and hoot owl and we begin to hear faint music in the wood tinny and incongruous and still we keep pulling back until a car is revealed a plymouth parked in a clearing andy dufresne wire rim glass threepiece suit under normal circumstance a respectable solid citizen hardly dangerous perhaps even meek but these circumstance are far from normal he is disheveled unshaven and very drunk a cigarette smolder in his mouth his eye flinty and hard are riveted to the bungalow up the path he can hear them fucking from here he raise a bottle of bourbon and knock it back the radio play softly painfully romantic taunting him you stepped out of a dream you are too wonderful to be what you seem he open the glove compartment pull out an object wrapped in a rag he lay it in his lap and unwraps it carefully revealing a revolver oily black evil he grab a box of bullet spill them everywhere all over the seat and floor clumsy he pick bullet off his lap loading them into the gun one by one methodical and grim six in the chamber his gaze go back to the bungalow he shuts off the radio abrupt silence except for the distant lover moan he take another shot of bourbon courage then open the door and step from the car his wingtip shoe crunch on gravel loose bullet scatter to the ground the bourbon bottle drop and shatters he start up the path unsteady on his foot the closer he get the louder the lovemaking becomes louder and more frenzied the lover are reaching a climax their sound of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasp and grunt oh godoh godoh god andy lurch to a stop listening the woman cry out in orgasm the sound slam into andys brain like an icepick he shuts his eye tightly wishing the sound would stop it finally doe dying away like a siren until all thats left is the shallow gasping and panting of postcoitus we hear languorous laughter moan of satisfaction oh godthats sooo goodyoure the bestthe best i ever had andy just stand and listens devastated he doesnt look like much of a killer now he just a sad little man on a dirt path in the wood tear streaming down his face a loaded gun held loosely at his side a pathetic figure really the jury listens like a gallery of mannequin on display palefaced and stupefied mr dufresne describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she wa murdered is on the witness stand hand folded suit and tie pressed hair meticulously combed he speaks in soft measured tone it wa very bitter she said she wa glad i knew that she hated all the sneaking around she said she wanted a divorce in reno what wa your response i told her i would not grant one refers to his note ill see you in hell before i see you in reno those were the word you used mr dufresne according to the testimony of your neighbor if they say so i really dont remember i wa upset what happened after you and your wife argued she packed a bag and went to stay with mr quentin glenn quentin the golf pro at the falmouth hill country club the man you had recently discovered wa her lover andy nod did you follow her i went to a few bar first later i decided to drive to mr quentins home and confront them they werent thereso i parked my car in the turnoutand waited with what intention im not sure i wa confused drunk i think mostly i wanted to scare them you had a gun with you yes i did when they arrived you went up to the house and murdered them no i wa sobering up i realized she wasnt worth it i decided to let her have her quickie divorce quickie divorce indeed a caliber divorce wrapped in a handtowel to muffle the shot isnt that what you mean and then you shot her lover i did not i got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off along the way i stopped and threw my gun into the royal river i feel ive been very clear on this point yes you have where i get hazy though is the part where the cleaning woman show up the next morning and find your wife and her lover in bed riddled with caliber bullet doe that strike you a a fantastic coincidence mr dufresne or is it just me softly yes it doe im sorry mr dufresne i dont think the jury heard that yes it doe doe what strike me a a fantastic coincidence on that sir we are in accord you claim you threw your gun into the royal river before the murder took place thats rather convenient it the truth you recall lt minchers testimony he and his men dragged that river for three day and nary a gun wa found so no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullet taken from the bloodstained corps of the victim thats also rather convenient isnt it mr dufresne faint bitter smile since i am innocent of this crime sir i find it decidedly inconvenient the gun wa never found the da hold the jury spellbound with his closing summation lady and gentleman youve heard all the evidence you know all the fact we have the accused at the scene of the crime we have foot print tire track bullet scattered on the ground which bear his fingerprint a broken bourbon bottle likewise with fingerprint most of all we have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying dead in each others arm they had sinned but wa their crime so great a to merit a death sentence he gesture to andy sitting quietly with his attorney i suspect mr dufresnes answer to that would be yes i further suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of september this year of our lord by pumping four bullet into his wife and another four into glenn quentin and while you think about that think about this he pick up a revolver spin the cylinder before their eye like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune a revolver hold six bullet not eight i submit to you this wa not a hotblooded crime of passion that could at least be understood if not condoned no this wa revenge of a much more brutal and coldblooded nature consider four bullet per victim not six shot fired but eight that mean he fired the gun emptyand then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again an extra bullet per loverright in the head a few juror shiver im done talking you people are all decent godfearing christian folk you know what to do camera track down a long table moving from one juror to the next these decent godfearing christian are chowing down on a nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county smacking

imperial at which point she hears a loud wail coming from the other end of the phone what the are you ok me yeah im excellent intercut between hazel on the patio and isaac head is buried in gu couch he wailing like a banshee having some kind of nervous breakdown i am however with isaac hazel hears more wailing ha no idea what to make of it dude hey doe support group hazel make this better or worse hazel genuinely ha no idea what the hell is going on isaac focus on me hazel wait a few beat for gu to come back on finally how fast can you get here hazel think about this and on her face cut to hazel descends the step she hears an ungodly moan before she see anyone what ha she gotten herself into gu appears at the base calling to isaac isaac hazel from support group is coming downstairs gu wait for a response none come he gesture for her to follow him into the room before he doe a gentle reminder isaac is in the midst of a psychotic episode you look nice by the way hazel blush follows gu into the room to find isaac sitting upside down in a gaming chair tear are flowing down his reddened cheek empty soda can and bag of junk food lie around him how ya doing isaac again no response hazel look to gu for an explanation seems isaac and monica are no longer a going concern oh im sorry do you want to talk about it isaac start to sob again he just want to cry and play video game fair enough it doesnt hurt to talk to him however if you have any sage word of feminine advice i actually think his response is appropriate pain demand to be felt light up at that youre quoting my book gu wink at her at which point isaac let out another howl gu gesture for hazel to sit the two of them flank isaac he finally speaks she didnt want to do it after the surgery said she couldnt handle it im about to lose my eyesight and she cant handle it hazel rub his shoulder in sympathy i kept saying always to her always always always and she just kept talking over me and not saying it back it wa like i wa already gone you know always wa a promise you cant break promise sometimes people dont understand the promise theyre making when they make them right sure but you keep the promise anyway thats what love is love is keeping the promise anyway that could be an encouragement it silent for a beat and then isaac stand up a funny look on his face isaac suddenly isaac start kicking his chair across the room here we go the chair land against the bed gu hand isaac something else to throw a pillow isaac grab the pillow and slam it against the wall he dive on it and being pummeling the pillow like a maniac thats it punch that thing and so he doe a he continues to gu look at hazel cigarette dangling from his mouth ive been wanting to call you on a nearly minutely basis but i have been waiting until i could form a coherent thought in re an imperial affliction i cant stop thinking about it i know right the only problem is the ending it is rather abrupt it torture i mean i totally get that she died or whatever anna but there is an unwritten contract between author and reader and i think ending your book in the middle of a sentence kind of violates that contract but thats part of what i like about it it portrays death truthfully you die in the middle of your life in the middle of a sentence but i do god i do want to know what happens to everyone else yeah like her mom the dutch tulip man sysiphus the hamster hazel beam gu totally get the book a bond between them have you tried contacting this peter van houten ive written letter he never responded apparently he moved to amsterdam became a recluse hasnt published anything doesnt do interview sad hang on turn to isaac isaac gu stand and take the pillow out of isaac hand pillow dont break gu hand isaac one

backyard staring up at the star she ring him back and a she doe splitscreen w hazel in the grass and gu upside down in bed a laptop on his chest hazel grace hello augustus so i read it again and i

still silent michael drive trying to keep it together frannies in the back with hazel head in her lap hazel continues to scream in silence whether from pain or terror we do not know id been poked and stabbed and poisoned for year and still i trod on michael carry hazel into the chaotic emergency room theyre practically running there still no sound but make no mistake the doctor rally to assist the screaming cry child shes wheeled away from her family who can only watch we stay with her and we hear in that moment i would have been very very happy to die the sound return and it the sound of a heart monitor beep beep beep it also the sound of a working heart hazel ha made it through her eye open a nurse is there hello hi youre ok hazel even hazel seems surprised by that would you like to see your parent hazel nod the nurse go to get them soon they come bounding in cry and kissing her repeatedly so much relief cut to later hazel bed ha been raised up so she can talk to her parent comfortably they thought it wa a brain tumor it wasnt thank god so what happened the usual fluid in the lung preventing oxygenation they put that in there a tube in hazel side draining fluid into a plastic bladder that hang off her bed drained a liter and a half last night thats a lot of fluid the good news is no tumor growth no new tumor in your body hazel nod that is a relief were all so relieved frannie embrace her daughter this is just a thing hazel it a thing we can live with hazel nod again only in the universe of hazel grace lancaster is something like this just a thing meanwhile

along with dr maria and three other oncologist her whole cancer team the great news is phalanxifor continues to control your tumor growth the not so great news is were still seeing serious problem with fluid accumulation so how should we proceed silence hazel look around the room wait for someone to answer no one doe um i feel like im not the most qualified person to answer that i wa talking to dr simmons dr simmons late white beard old school speaks next it a strange case normally the tumor start resisting the treatment but that hasnt happened here yet hazel hears the yet the loudest unfortunately the drug may be worsening the edema but if we stopped it entirely were likely to face even graver danger so were gon na do nothing thats what we have to decide the truth is very few people have been on phalanxifor a long a hazel ha we dont really know the long term effect that comfort no one cant i just get like a lung transplant or something the doctor look at one another like who want to take that one eventually you would not be considered a strong candidate for a transplant hazel take that in nod try to pretend it didnt bother her sensitive michael on the other hand start to cry a little bit he grab frannies hand were trying to prevent endothelial growth while at the same time preventing immunosorbent a dr simmons drone on with some cancer gobbledygook hazel eye remain firmly fixed on her parent she hate what shes doing to them and seeing them holding hand cry but trying not to cry it jog a memory cut to we saw this once before it look like the end for old hazel her father is weeping off to the side while her mom stand over her holding her hand and asking through the tear are you ready sweetie old hazel nod the doctor get to work the anaesthetic take hold and

staring at them she try to shake it off dr simmons is still talking nonsense when i have a question yes hazel can i still go to amsterdam dr simmons cant help himself he laugh everyone look at him he clear his throat that would not be wise at this juncture why not excuse me why not dr simmons the doctor are trying to be delicate here it would increase some risk so doe going to the mall yes but an airplane they have oxygen on airplane it my life right youre stage iv i have this opportunity i may never have again if the medicine working i dont see why because hazel look i dont know any other way

on a park bench his arm around her looking out over the water seed blow from the elm tree and the reflection of the city ripple in the water below them hazel lean into his body just a little they stay like that savoring the best night of both of their life cut to a crisp spring morning in amsterdam the buzz in the air outside is equalled by the buzz in where hazel excitedly pace through the room i really dont get that shirt hazel wear a screen print tshirt of magritte ceci nest pa une pipe a painting of a pipe with word below that mean this is not a pipe van houten will get it trust me there are like fifty magritte reference in imperial affliction this is not a pipe exactly but it is a pipe no it not it a drawing of a pipe see all representation of a thing are inherently abstract a drawing of a thing is not the thing itself nor is a tshirt of a drawing of a thing the thing itself frannie is still at a loss but shes impressed when did you get so grown up i feel like it wa yesterday i wa telling old hazel why the sky wa blue you thought i wa a genius back then why is the sky blue because i say so a knock on the door gu poke his head in who ready for some answer gu and hazel stand outside van houtens white house im so excited i can barely breathe a opposed to other day she playfully hit him he take her arm pick up the oxygen tank and up they go towards his front door a they approach there a noticeable noise coming from inside the house it the deep thump of a bass beat loud like obnoxiously loud hazel grab the brass ornament and knock they wait there no response maybe he cant hear over the music gu try again this time with more force still nothing he try a third time finally the music stop they wait still excited a moment later the door swing open it a man in pajama with a huge potbelly thinning hair and a weekold beard all he say is what gu and hazel look to one another could it be mr van houten at which point the pajama man slam the door in their face hazel and gu are too stunned to react through the closed door they hear this are they here peter so it is peter van houten gu and hazel cant believe it there are two who the hell they they

open opened by the woman whose voice theyd been hearing van houtens assistant lidewij dutch pretty in a bookish way she virtually shove van houten towards a stunned gu and hazel and they are again facetoface with van houten one beat two beat no one know what to say finally which of you is augustus water gu raise his hand tentatively van houten size them up without another word he turn and walk inside at least this time leaving the door ajar please i am sorry come in hazel and gu share one more awkward glance before gu take a step hazel follows they walk lidewij lead gu and hazel into a living room so sterile it creepy the wall are empty and white there a single couch a small ottoman and a single lounge chair thats it van houten sits in the chair off to the side are two large black garbage bag full and twisttied trash fan mail year worth he never open it van houten kick his foot up on the ottoman and cross his slipper he motion for them to sit on the couch yours are the first missive to which ive replied and look where that got me hazel and gu take their seat scotch um no thanks augustus water it just me then lidewij scotch and soda perhaps some breakfast first peter she

houten say nothing to that i do not have a drinking problem i have a churchillian relationship with alcohol i can crack joke and govern england and do anything i want to do except not drink he glance over at lidewij who dutifully refill his glass incidentally thank you for dinner last night we bought them dinner last night it wa our pleasure youve come a long way so what is it i can do for you we have some question uhhuh about what happens you know after the end of your book specifically to those who anna leaf behind like her mom the dutch tulip man sisy how familiar are you with swedish hiphop hazel look at gu is he kidding i would say limited but presumably you know afasi och filthys seminal album flacken um lidewij play bomfalleralla immediately lidewij sigh but she doe a shes told a few second later some loud swedish rap song blast from the speaker hazel and gu sit through this totally baffled yelling over the music im sorry sir we dont speak swedish who the hell speaks swedish the important thing is not what nonsense the voice are saying but what the voice are feeling the song continues another awkward ten second or so before gu ha enough he get up and turn off the music are you messing with u pardon is this some kind of performance rudolf otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous then his work wa not for you and i say to you my friend if you can not hear afasi och filthys bravadic response to fearfulness then my work is not for you hazel is really getting worried at this point they came all this way for this so anyway when the book end anna mom raising a hand to silence let u imagine that you are racing a tortoise hazel and gu fidget in their seat lidewij frown clearly feeling bad for them van houten continues the tortoise ha a ten yard head start in the time it take you to run ten yard the tortoise ha moved maybe one yard and so on forever you are faster than the tortoise but you can never catch him you see you can only decrease his lead now certainly you can run past the tortoise a long a you dont contemplate the mechanic involved but the question of how turn out to be so complicated that no one really solved it until cantor proof that some infinity are bigger than other infinity hazel and gu have no idea how to respond i assume that answer your question i dont know whats going on and yet you seemed so intelligent in print mr water under his breath must be all that cancer in your brain peter gu could throw a punch right now hazel try to calm the situation can we please maybe talk about anna for a sec i mean i understand that the story end mid sentence because she dy or she becomes too sick to continue im not interested in talking about that book but that doesnt mean her family and everyone she love doesnt have a future right i said im not interested but you promised mr van houten you said you would tell u what happens and thats why were here we i need you tell me surely youve thought about it i mean a character nothing happens to them theyre fiction they cease to exist the moment the novel is over this is not what hazel came all this way to hear she wont accept it they cant again ha to calm i mean i understand in a literary sense but it impossible not to imagine some future i cant do this lidewij get rid of them please lidewij doesnt move he turn back to hazel i wont indulge your childish whim i refuse to pity you in the manner in which youre accustomed i dont want your pity of course you do like all sick kid your existence depends on it peter on a roll you are fated to live out your day a the child you were when diagnosed the child who belief there is life after a novel end and we a adult we pity this so we pay for your treatment for your oxygen machine we give you food and water though you are unlikely to live long enough you are a side effect of an evolutionary process that care little for individual life you are a failed experiment in mutation lidewij ha tear in her eye gu ha balled his fist but not hazel van houtens word have not phased her one bit she rise from the couch hey listen douchepants youre not gon na tell me anything i dont already know about illness i need one thing and one thing only from you before i walk out of your life and thats for you to tell me what happens to your goddman character i can not tell you bullshit i can not van houten go to take a

houten realizes he alone in this id like you to leave now youre really not gon na tell u i would like you to leave hazel is furious gu stand next to her touch her arm is if to say come on enough of this guy cut to gu and hazel come out of the house practically shaking a they get to the street van houten ha one more thing to say have you ever stopped to ask why you care so much about your silly

hazel thats when lidewij come outside clearly shes been cry too im so sorry circumstance ha made him cruel i thought meeting you would help him if he would see that his work ha shaped real life but im very sorry hazel say nothing gu hold her in a very protective way perhaps we can do some sightseeing have you seen the anne frank house im not going anywhere with that monster he is not invited lidewij walk back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news im afraid there no elevator oh um thats alright no there are many stair steep stair i can do it i can do it hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointment today they are going inside cut to a video play on a monitor showing the nazi invasion of holland hazel and gu stand with lidewij in a pack of backpacker and traveler about to take the tour many of them begin to walk up the first flight of stair shall we hazel nod both hazel and gu walk slowly up the stair so far so good they find themselves in an office space this is the bookcase that hid the frank family and four others the bookcase is half open behind it is an even steeper set of stair only wide enough for one person at a time some of the traveler begin to walk up the stair gu look at hazel are you sure we should continue she begin the climb determined lidewij trail behind carrying her oxygen tank hazel move very slowly we are aware of her labored breathing the entire time angle on other tourist watching and quietly commenting just like at the airport except now in foreign language hazel arrives on the next floor an empty room shes definitely starting to struggle she lean against the wall to catch her breath gu come to her side wipe her brow youre a champion hazel smile when shes feeling up to it they walk into the next room also empty and another staircase even more narrow and steep practically a ladder when gu see this he look at hazel thats enough im ok hazel very slowly begin the climb again were aware of her every breath it dark and it becoming very difficult near the top hazel stumble but is finally able to pull herself through once there she fall to the floor slumping against the wall trying to catch her breath gu crouch next to her were at the top thats it hazel becomes aware that tourist look at her with concern she smile stand up nothing to see here and now theyre in the final room a long narrow hallway this is where anne

how you go on without your family lidewij stay behind to study part of the exhibit gu lead hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a video detail the last day of anne frank life over it we hear a young girl voice reading from the diary the traveler stand to watch and listen gu and hazel do the same the room is dark at such moment i dont think about the misery gu and hazel stand very closely together the video is the cherry on top of a very emotional day hazel watch it but about the beauty that still remains gu meanwhile is just watching hazel the same way she watched him on the airplane after a beat she catch him their eye meet the emotion build try to recapture the happiness within yourself think of all the beauty in everything around you and be happy and hazel kiss gu a most passionate intense youandme againsttheworld kind of kiss better than any theyve experienced or could even imagine it seems to last for a small eternity eventually they break away and open their eye they quickly notice all the traveler staring at them for a brief second they wonder if that wa a very inappropriate thing to do when suddenly everyone start clapping for them moved by the whole

sequence crane shot we see chris stop the datsun in the middle of the desert road we crane down to a closeup through the windshield chris look left then right into the rearview mirror and suddenly turn the wheel veering the datsun off the paved highway into the vast desert a we crane back up the datsun move into the horizon the datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just before darkness slide over the desert it is positioned at the foot of a wash wall that edge the soup bowl the datsun a yellow speck in the frame coyote yap at the moon other than that no sound on the desert floor in the distance voluptuous cumulonimbus cloud boil upward catching the last rosy glow of the westsetting sun over the rim of the upper detrital watershed we see strobe burst of lightning followed by muffled thunder illuminating the thunder cloud from within short series of angle a we move in on the distant gully and ravine starting to run with copious amount of water chris mccandless in the same clothes he had been in back in the rooming house sleep in the back seat of the datsun his head supported by his backpack we begin to hear a rumble but this rumble is not thunder it rapidly build into an alarming roar the roar grows to a deafening level chris awakens a he peek up from the backseat looking forward through the windshield he just barely catch sight of the leading edge of a flash flood a fourfoot high wall of water mud and debris make impact with the datsun momentarily enveloping it in water suddenly the car is slammed against the cliff crack chris sits upright disoriented pov a far a the eye can see in the desert moonlight water ha taken over the desert with a flash flood however there no panic in chris face a we observe him past a new crack in the wet windshield the water while violent seems to have topped off just above the wheel chris get a slight smile on his face a the car settle into it new position below the cliff he return to sleep what remains of chris travelling money burn in a pile beside the datsun on the sunlit but muddy desert floor we follow a very long set of footprint camera trackingtrue vertical away from the burning cash through the mud finally tilting up to the footprint maker chris slogging toward high ground wideshot we see the abandoned datsun nearly a mile behind chris a he walk toward u wearing his backpack he come very close to camera

nail inthe hatchway from below he climb down the step wherehe exchange his hammer for his microphone from an offcamera source well it look like weve succeeded we hear the monster growl from above at least for the moment in sealing the beast back into the vault your humble reporter chris mccandless will now struggle with the journalistic question of ethic will he retain his reporter objectiveness or save the future of human truth by slaying this awful beast he give u a look of vaudevillian puzzlement what will he do we pick up with chris in a corridor outside a door with a cheap paperandtape label announcing the adjacent room a the office of ted turner once again your humble reporter chris mccandless we hear o student commenting on chris and his video crew what is this filmmaking point

solo of tender isthe nightcamera tilt up to the monster looking out the hatchwayslowly dying from the song being sungas the song continues to be sung and the monstercontinues to die the audio recedes and video image go when we were little chris wa very to himself he wasnt antisocial he always had friend and everybody liked him but he could go off and entertain himself for hour he didnt seem to need toy or friend he could be alone without being lonely the secret our parent kept though unknown to chris and i led to bout of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young it seemed like they never fought without u i remember the first family meeting to let chris and me in on their plan for getting a divorce they wanted u to choose which of them wed live with i cried my eye out but the divorce never happened though the threat and meeting never stopped it wasnt long before chris and i shut off we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce chris and i just wanted to get away from their fight and mom kept promising to get out and take u with her a soon a their company made enough money dad had been the young genius that nasa enlisted to do crucial design for the american satellite radar system that would be our answer to the russian sputnik and mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her getup andgo resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge by the time the company actually made it first million the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise shed made u i think this is when chris began to see career a a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent money and the useless priority people made of it in their life hed begun planning to slay the beastto make himself free the beast dy we see a pile of berry sitting atop a handkerchief beside them a survivalist guide to edible growth the glare of the sun penetrating the canvas a fly buzz and land hanging

johnson mccandless walt billie and carine sit around the kitchen table in august a copy of chris ticket ha been sent to the annandale address and sits before them billie and carine sit silently walts on the phone if chris were trying to disappear it would have been a pretty uncharacteristic lapse for him to give the police his real place of residence though my parent had already contacted the annandale police with their initial concern this ticket arriving from california made them frantic my father called one of his old government friend who put him in touch with a private investigator someone whod done work with the dia and the cia using the willow creek ticket a a starting point the investigator began chasing down lead most of them led far afield to europe and south africa ultimately turning up nothing what my dad couldnt believe wa that hed given up his car he seemed to love that datsun so much it sounded just like chris to me though he wa very much of the school that

walking across the idaho panhandle cooking the last of his rice on the montana border hitchhiking in the montana sunset we see chris hitching down a lonely twolane road surrounded by field and distant mountain in early september mom and dad got a call from the annandale police notifying them that chris abandoned car had been identified by the arizona highway patrol after a group of rare flower hunter stumbled upon it in the desert there were no sign that chris had intended to return to it but there wasnt any evidence of struggle the police said they thought chris had chosen to leave it behind and not that it had been taken from him nonetheless the initial comfort that gave mom and dad quickly turned to their realization that chris wa actually trying not to be found we see walt he walk out the door of his house into the street he keep walking and we go with him in his silent but internal armageddon we pull him in cu throughout all that followsrefer to scene dad call it

into our house in annandale he had a scruffy beard his hair wa long and tangled and he wa rail thin a soon a i heard he wa home i ran into his room to talk to him in california hed looked up some old family friend who still lived there hed found out that long after he had been born our dad had continued a relationship with his first wife marcia in secret brief cutaway to chris hitching on the montana highway and that one lie had led to another that two year after chris wa born dad had had another son with marcia worse yet wa that it wa marcia to whom he wa still legally married at the time and it wa chris and i who were the bastard child walt dad arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused and mom in the shame and embarrassment of a young mistress became his accomplice she and my dad had decided to bend thetruth about this other child saying thatdad wasnt the father and they maintainedthat their fraudulent marriage wa real chris wa quiet when he told me this hesaid it made his entire childhood seemlike a fiction that the truth had beendying everyday if something botheredchris hed usually keep it to himselfand he made me promise to do the same he never did tell mom and dad that he knew but chris measured himself and those around him by an impossibly rigorous moral code he loathed what he considered mom and dad hypocrisy and resented what they considered guidance chris submitted to dad authority through college but i knew he raged inwardly the whole time it wa inevitable that chris would rebel and when he did he did it with characteristic immoderation walt suddenly collapse to his knee weeping heartbroken and ashamed on a quiet annandale street in the shadowless light of dusk my father is a brilliant man but he had made some terrible mistake and to some extent it seemed chris wa making him pay an awful price the image of walt dissolve into a pickup truck pull over for chris a chris jump in we see on the passenger side door the

onto the boulevard she see a hitchhiker roadside she crane her head is it chris it not she convinces herself it chris that it her son whenever she pass a stray and i fear for the mother in her we see chris hitchhiking in a barren desert instinct that seem to sense the threat of a loss so huge and irreparable that the mind balk at taking it measure i begin to wonder if i do understand what chris is saying any longer but i catch myself in doubt and remember that these are not the parent he grew up with that in the forced reflection that come with loss indeed everything chris is saying ha to be said and i trust for him that everything he is doing ha to be done this is our life chris is in the passenger seat of a mac truck cab both chris and the trucker look outward a though to find an

favorite song which wa hard i like all type of music turn out they really just needed one i knew all the word to i went with james taylor you got a friend i hope it hasnt been too torturous that wasnt the point the point is that you learn it and for u to have that knowledge in common who the fuck are you people oh right okay let me back up and give you the cliff note the armitages and i are a part of a society a pretty extraordinary society actually one whose sole purpose for many many year ha been a search for a very powerful object armitage lineage redefined the nature of that search they proved that the power didnt just exist in that object you see with science the armitages created a miracle you hypnotize me break my will make me a slave like the others this is some crazy racist shit no not racist chris we dont hate you we want to be you you are not going to be a slave youre going to be a vessel wait what missy hypnosis wa merely to sedate you oh that and to prepare you psychologically for what jim smile for the procedure whats the procedure are you ready drum roll please brain transplantation some say it could never be done they experimented for century but it turned out relinking the brain to a foreign central nervous system wa impossible the nerve connection are far too intricate and delicate what the fuck dean the only guy who really get the science he the one who discovered that full brain transplantation isnt actually necessary to transfer the soul and that partial brain transplantation solves the little nerve ending problem no jim hold up a color coded diagram of the human brain there is a big red part that take up of the image the other is blue and located near the lower back of his skull okay so you see the blue part thats the piece of your brain thats all rooted in the nervous system so that stay keeping those tricky little connection intact the rest is discarded then theyll remove the red part of my brain from my skull and put in yours your blue and my red basically absorb each other and apparently the brain heals surprisingly fast so assuming everything go a planned we should be up and functioning in a couple week and my brain your red part itll be discarded but dont worry you wont be gone well not completely youll still be in there somewhere limited consciousness of course youll still be able to see and hear but your existence will be a a passenger an audience you will live in the sunken place yes thats what she call it good so you understand ill control the motor function the will of our body effectively me you will be me a far a the world is concerned it still a pretty new operation some kink were supposed to stay away from flash of light for example they can trigger a momentary lapse in control of motor function why black people jim is disappointed in the question well because you get the highest bid for the last decade or so anyway i wish it wa le simple than that but it not youre in fashion baby final hope sink from chris shoulder honestly though personally i couldnt give two shit about race i dont care if youre black brown green purple whatever what i want is so much deeper your eye man i want those thing you see through thats crazy take it a a compliment youre not going to get away with this we have and we will well be together soon brother the television turn off chris clench his body trying to pry

hardboiled egg in a bowl a shaker of salt and some change heroux salt the egg and the beer his piercing eye stuck on he devours the egg down the beer then let out a belch the man next to him give a friendly nod heroux doesnt respond he kick back from the bar dragging his ax behind heroux walk past a piano being played whisper something into the player ear then throw the change from his meal onto the piano top the piano player tip his hat and change tune to something more festive manic almost heroux continues into the back walking like a man in a half dream at the table el katook deal out a

sound come from deep in the pooping hole he look down just in time to see stugleys boot disappear through the pool of shit and piss heroux step out of the outhouse into the carnage of the back room exhausted and bloody from tip to toe he take a seat at the card table prop his ax next to him and start drinking whats left of the slaughtered men beer no one in the saloon seems to pay much mind to

bryan wood scott beck we hear very clearly the sound of light wind we come up on a streetlight there is no illumination and no movement we hold on it for a long moment when suddenly the streetlight bob and then begin to sway we slowly begin to rise up on the streetlight to reveal a small bird ha landed on it we continue to rise to reveal behind the bird wind blow through the gargantuan evergreen that seem to engulf the narrow main street of a small town in upstate new york shop window and car on either side covered in dust the place seems frozen in time there is no movement in the very middle of the road one can see sand a bizarre incongruity a long pathway about a shovel width run the full length of the street with offshoot into open doorway of some of the shop we hold for a long moment slowly pushing through the doorway of a large general store also covered in dust to the left a cash register with small shelf of nearly empty candy box below to the right a towering shelf full of bag of potato chip nacho chip and pretzel none are missing we move slowly across the floor down the middle of a general store amid the towering shelf of good on either side one may recognize a barely perceptible pattern of which shelf are bare and which are not there is no movement no sound suddenly tiny foot jump into our moving frame then a fast a they appeared theyre gone we now move up the side of the store looking down one aisle and the next a we arrive at the next aisle we catch a glimpse of a small dark figure and then it gone we continue along the side of the store until we arrive at the last aisle at the far end of the store we see a counter with a window and shelf suddenly a woman we go close on the woman a she scan the shelf slowly lowering herself to the ground until behind her we see an year old boy sitting slumped against the wall he is barefoot on closer inspection we see sweat on the boy brow his skin pale from fever the woman knee touch down on the ground next to the boy a she see what shes been looking for she reach out her hand we go close on her hand a it reach toward a shelf of orange prescription drug bottle her hand suddenly begin to shift certain bottle ever so slightly at a bizarrely slow pace she doe not make a sound a she doe this we get our first glimpse of name name of drug name of people her hand finally arrives at the very back of the shelf a she gently twist a bottle that read amoxicillin on the mother a she inhales slowly and then a if doing surgery she slowly close her hand around the bottle and gently begin to move it through the shelf toward her her hand once again move incredibly slowly her now wider closed hand shift even more bottle a it pass just a she get to the end of the shelf a bottle shift with a rattle of pill this is the first deliberate sound weve heard the mother freeze we rack focus to the boy on the ground who now look up with panic the mother eye look all around the room the way one doe when they are waiting for something listening for something after a long moment she pull the bottle in her hand the final few inch and off the shelf the mother draw a huge breath of relief a she stand up we reveal just over the counter two eye looking up at a year old girl stand on her toe barely able to see over the wooden counter to her mother she smile at her mother and give her a thumb up with that shes off we follow her a she run lightly through the store she is also barefoot the girl turn down an aisle to reveal a small boy sitting on the floor he too is barefoot a the girl approach we see in the thick dust on the floor he ha drawn a rocket ship she sits with him he silently put his hand to his chest palm to the side cross his first two finger of his other hand with deliberate focus and then slowly put his two hand together he then look up at her and quickly shoot his crossed finger into the air like a rocket she beam with pride for a moment and then sign back to him very good job thats how we get away the girl smile fall ever so slightly then the boy suddenly tap her on the shoulder and scurry away shes it a the girl slowly get up to follow him we see for the first time a hearing aid the boy disappears around a corner the girl come around the tall shelf into the next aisle when suddenly her eye go wide what she see is the boy standing on a small box stretching to reach a toy on a high shelf she walk quickly to him when suddenly the toy the girl instinctively slide to the ground and catch the toy just a it about to hit the ground on her face we can see she is terrified she close her eye taking a breath with relief when she open them in the foreground we see the toy she is holding a small toy space shuttle then in the distance past the toy we see a figure she sits up to see a man standing outside the door of the general store holding a large box with what look like a quilt hanging out of it a look of fear on his face softens a he mime wiping his brow with relief she smile put the toy back on a shelf and run to him the father gently put the box on the ground and pull back the piece of thick quilt to reveal that all the content are actually wrapped in it he then reach for a large hiking back pack and beginstransferring the content of the box into the bag a hedoes we see can of food a variety of prescriptionpills bandage and wrapped syringesthe girl arrives at his side and excitedly start rummagingthrough the box a well a she doe we see thickpaintbrushes bottle of glue bottle of lighter fluid and astack of old newspaper then her face light up fromthe box she pull

surgically remove the battery and place the shuttle in the hood of her brother sweatshirt covering it from view she hold a finger up to her lip in the obligatory big sister way of telling him not to get her in trouble he beam she then stand up and place the battery back on the counter smile at her brother and gesture let go the daughter exit the general store and follows her mother and father who are walking down the street only stepping on the sand path their step are almost silent after a moment her four year old brother follows behind her we watch everyone walk in total silence then we slowly push in to the counter of the store and then realize the battery are gone a long road slice it way through a heavily wooded area which further block the already fading sun in wide profile we see the family walking in a line continuing only on a sand path the father is in front carrying their sick son then the mother with the backpack then their blonde daughter and trailing a bit behind rumble their robust year old from the ground we look up at an old and rusted bridge towering over u eerily the sand path continues across it we track with the family a they walk across the bridge there are minor creak underneath the sand suddenly we see the four year old stop just before the entrance of bridge the family continues not seeing him we follow the boy hand a he fish around in his hood and pull out the toy shuttle head on we walk with the father each member of his proud brood can be seen walking behind him we can hear his strained breath and the tiniest swish of the footstep in sand head on walking with the daughter we now suddenly hear nothing a she look to be in her own world so we are in hers a smile break on her face a she walk and breathes in total silence we walk with her for a long moment when suddenly behind her the girl doe not turn she just keep walking still smiling a she look up to her mother we go into from the girl pov we see her mother and father spin around with a frantic shock on their face back on the girl she look confused at her parent behavior light again flash eerily behind her on the father rushing to put the boy on the ground and turning to run on the mother spinning around with terror in her eye she look to be holding in a scream back on the girl slowly beginning to turn around at what her parent could be looking at a we a loud playful beeping rush in from the blinkingshuttlethen from the wood we hear the most unmistakeable on the mother a she slowly lower the backpack to theground and her leg begin to fail her on the father running violently shaking his head itlooks like he holding in a scream the tree behind them rustle and snap a somethingbarrels through on the boy holding up his space ship proudly to hisincoming father an enormous smile on his face on the father foot away his face is a still frameof pure fear a he run to camera then a shriek a scream a crunch thenon the father a a thin line of blood splatter on hisface mid run the father body immediately go limp failinghim a he come to a halt just in front of camera then a quickly a it came the sound is gone in wide profile the father stand lifeless the twochildren stand frozen with fear the mother drop to herknees and a space shuttle blink silently in the sandthe four year old is goneonce again only the wind can be heard still in black a new sound almost like that of the ocean the new sound continues in the last of the day sunlight we track looking straight down on what appears to be an empty beach the pink lit sand now combined with a sound like the ocean feel serene almost otherworldly slowly coming into frame we see the face of the daughter this is regan abbott her hair is much longer she is now two year older she just look different regan lay in the sand with eye closed but she is not asleep with her brow furrowed and her closed eye darting back and forth she look oddly pained almost a if she is wishing herself to another place there is movement in her hand a her finger caress an object her eye suddenly pop open a she sits up violently close up into our frame she look around with eye wet and red attempting to regain her bearing we slowly move around her to see what she see and are met with a jarringly incongruous landscape instead of a glistening ocean there in front of regan stand the tall swaying stalk of a cornfield a regan look to her lap we slowly travel down to reveal she is holding the toy shuttle a she maneuver it through her finger we see the shuttle is damaged there are large gouge in the fuselage suddenly something startle her a she snap her head to the side we go close on her hand driving the toy shuttle into the sand not wanting it to be seen now only the shuttle tail is exposed in the foreground a we see a figure walking toward regan coming into focus is her mother this is evelyn abbott evelyn too ha changed hair longer frame lower she carry a basket of vegetable she is bare foot evelyn stop and look down at her daughter giving her a comforting smile regan cant seem to return the same evelyn gently gesture with her head regan nod and evelyn walk on after a moment regan place the toy shuttle into the large pocket in her dress and follows her mother a she go we pan to follow regan a she join her mother and then slowly rise to reveal that the two woman are walking along a long and wide sand path in the middle of a farm in the distance we can see they are heading to a weathered red we end our rise just a we reveal in the foreground christmas light like parallel telephone wire cable of large bulb one with red and one with white they dance playfully in the wind close up profile of a steering wheel in the foreground a weathered chevy emblem reflects the fire orange sky in the background hand come into frame and gently grip the steering wheel the right hand then slowly move to the ignition block and turn there is no sound after a moment the hand turn againagain without sound the hand turn a third time this time the hand begin to bob ever so slightly a if the old car ha started up a the hand retracts we pull back to reveal the little brother this is marcus abbott now moving ever so slightly marcus is obviously pretending to drive though his impassive face betrays the idea that he is having any fun marcus seems to have aged much more than the mere year his vacant eye tell u a large toll ha been taken on him though perhaps not a easily recognizable on the exterior we move slowly in pov along another large sand path with high grass on either side when suddenly it open up into a large clearing and we see a tractor shell of untouched farm equipment litter the open area we slowly move left making our way through what is now nothing more than an eery farming vehicle graveyard suddenly a dark figure enters the frame marcuss hand move silently along the steering wheel a he stare out the windshield his body move ever so slightly his face relaxes the hint of a smile for a moment we could almost believe he is driving his eye routinely check the side mirror then the rearview mirror then stop his hand and face fall through the rear view mirror we see a figure standing behind the truck amidst the sea of farm equipment behind the figure we see a towering silo over the dark figure onto the truck a we see marcus expertly slip out of the cab window of a vintage chevy pickup that sits at the edge of a descending driveway connecting to the road that head back toward the barn he land in the sand without a sound and begin to walk head held low toward the dark figure who reach his hand out and briefly touch marcus shoulder marcus walk straight past a marcus exit we boom up the dark figure a it turn revealing leon abbott lee lee too ha changed though much more obviously he ha lost weight on his strong farmer frame he wear a beard and his sunken eye indicate that he hasnt slept well in a long time we pull back wide to reveal the sea of farm equipment sits in front of a long dilapidated work shed roof a makeshift repair shop the word repair is written in flaking white paint that cling to the wood above the line of christmas light dance in the foreground we tilt down to see that the light run right in between two towering door of a weathered red barn the door have been left open by a gap of just over foot the edge of the door are wrapped in foam suddenly marcus walk into frame and enters the barn we tilt down from the line of unilluminated christmas light running below the high reaching ceiling and onto marcus back a he walk through two heavy quilt at the entry of the barn hanging from the ceiling through the quilt a dirt floor guide u through this barn the surroundings are too difficult to fully comprehend at first glance to the left are several large horse stall we quickly pan inside to see they are now bedroom mattress perfectly made up lie on the floor next to lamp and small stack of book clothes on hanger dangle between each of the bar providing not only storage but limited privacy to the right is a large pen with railing once a holding area for cow awaiting milking it is now a living room hay bale draped in blanket and old wooden chair surround an overturned pig trough now serving a a coffee table covered in book and dripping candle a marcus continues we notice the wall every inch is meticulously covered in a bizarre but elegant cornucopia of trash foam cardboard and old newspaper are glued to the wall in thick layer if one were able to look past the obvious first assumption of a hovel or domicile of hoarder they would see almost a deliberate beauty in the decor a warmth this is a well maintained and loving home we follow on marcus back a he suddenly come to a mattress laying on the ground marcus bend down and after a brief struggle push the mattress to one side to reveal a large hole we follow just behind marcus a he descends down the ground we now see marcus ha descended a makeshift stairwell into a small excavated room illuminated by work light lodged up against the wall and across the ceiling are wooden beam in between each beam are varying stage of an elaborate process of insulation and sound proofing that consists of a thick layer of newspaper a a base and then blanket and pillow squeezed in on top there is a hay bale up against one wall and a mattress leaned up against another in the middle of the room marcus walk past evelyn who is bent over behind an odd wooden box suddenly she stand up holding a beautiful and delicate baby mobile a she turn and reach the mobile high in the air to a beam above her we get a clear shot of her protruding belly even a layman guess would put her over month evelyngently tap the mobile a weare now close on the small duck and cloud moving throughthe air evelyn below looking up with a smilemarcus sits down next to regan who is on the floor next to astack of old newspaper and bottle of glueshe remove a large sheet of newspaper from a plastic tray ofglue let it drip and then applies it to the wall with athick paintbrush a she move the paintbrush vertically downthe dripping white a piece of an image can be seen it isa bra ad regan slowly look over to marcus who stare atitback on evelyn a she remove the top of the odd wooden boxwe follow her hand in to reveal a heavily quilted insidewith adorable baby blanket a small teddy bear and aclear plastic air maskevelyns finger fumble with something in the corner untilshe finally thread through a thin plastic tube andconnects it to the air mask it look similar to anemergency breathing apparatus one might see in an ambulanceor hospital because it isback on marcus a he now remove a large piece of drippingnewspaper out of the tray and place it on the wall like hissister he swipe his thick paintbrush vertically down thedripping white this time partially revealing a front pageheadline it read marcus look at it inquisitively and then swipe thepaintbrush horizontally across the whole headlineit read marcus freeze then look below to see the top of a grainynewspaper photograph all we can make out is a twistedhuman arm his hand slowly begin to shake a he raise thepaintbrush to reveal the rest of the image when suddenly marcus jump only to see his mom holding a pillowover the newspaper with a knowing look after a beat shehands marcus a long piece of tape to secure the pillow to thewall on the back of lee perched on what look like the top of the world from this great height we get our first wide shot of the large farm that we now see sits in a clearing on a ridge surrounded by the tangled forest of the appalachian a puff of smoke rise from lee silhouette a he suddenly raise a hand into frame and check his watch a moment later a if on cue a line of christmas light flicker to life above the wide sand path regan wa laying on another line of white christmas light flicker on this time revealing a path that connects the weathered red barn to an old white farmhouse then another line of light and another like the image of a city power grid coming back to life we see a labyrinth of countless sand path meticulously laid out illuminate all over the farm in a beautiful expanse now in profile lee stare down seemingly at nothing the unfiltered cigarette burn to his finger causing lee to snap out of his stupor he look around at the horizon it is officially sundown he reach for a plastic bottle of lighter fluid and spray all it content into a shallow metal drum in front of him another cigarette appears from below frame he put it in his mouth and then reach his hand into his jacket his right arm jiggle slightly there is no sound his arm jiggle again then from his jacket lee pull a fully lit lighter that he protects from the wind he light his cigarette and then lean his hand to the metal drum a in the glowing orange we see lee take a long drag of his cigarette his face ha no affect after several moment the flame begin to weaken and slowly fade suddenly far far off in the distance on the ridge another flame illuminates lee doesnt even look up then mile past the first another flame then another until we can see behind lee glowing fire scattered far off across the ridge on lee a he glance over and register then back to staring front a we move around behind him to see where his gaze is focused then we see it there in his left hand lee hold a nursery school photo of a year old boy lee take a last drag of his cigarette and then place the photo in a small box at his foot we are tight on the box a lee stand and walk toward two curved bar on the side of the silo he turn around and begin to descend a ladder we hold on the small box then just a lee head disappears we slowly begin to rise now looking at the opposite side of the ridge than we did in the beginning the rising moon light now spill across the vista of rock and tree and onto an enormous and bizarrely out of place crater we hold on the crater for a long moment then we are close on a small mound of dirt suddenly two hand covered in winter glove enter frame and begin to dig down about inch to reveal a plank of wood wider now we see evelyn on her hand and knee just behind the living room set up in an open very makeshift kitchen one wall of shelf cluttered with stack of paper plate bowl and cup another wall is a workbench acting a a counter top and a mid refrigerator evelyn extract from the dirt a long wooden box beneath it red hot rock let off a combination of steam and smoke evelyn brings the box to the counter top and carefully lift the lid to reveal a perfectly cooked fish with lemon and rosemary and garlic scattered all around we track with regan a she walk down the row of horse stall bedroom regan arrives at the threshold of lee and evelyns bedroom lee is faced away from her washing his face in a long trough like sink that run the length of the room suddenly through the mirror leaning on the wall lee see her but doe not turn through the mirror the two of them looking silently at each other for a moment too long it is heartbreaking regan pathetically gesture eating a lee nod trying to muster a polite smile we can see very clearly something is broken lee wipe his face with a towel and then turn to face an empty doorway the family sits down together for dinner around an old workbench their head bowed in prayer after a moment evelyn lift her head and they begin to eat there are no plate the food sits on various childrens plastic placemats there are no utensil the family us only bread to collect food we slowly pull back on this silent but comfortingly familiar scene regan and marcus lie on the floor playing monopoly by the dim light of an oil lantern we can see the game board is the same but the piece are small colored bobble of wool the kind you would find on a childrens christmas sweater the house and hotel are empty sugar packet blue and pink and the money small piece of green red blue and orange fabric rectangle all equally sized marcus is five space away from his sister hotel on boardwalk he take a sip of water and place the cup on top of a tall crate being used a a makeshift side table marcus look at his sister who cant hide her smile he mime a prayer before rolling the dice on the dirt floor where it make no noise marcus slowly look up to regan knowing his fate regan smile pointedly and then reach for marcus money a marcus thrust his arm back to protect his bank his elbow hit the oil lantern a booming crash a the oil lantern hit the ground and shatters the sound feel huge a it is the first big sound weve heard fire erupts on the floor the child stare frozen in horror lee immediately jump up from the table and instinctively grab a quilt and throw it on the fire with a few silent pat the fire is gone regan shoot marcus a look of concern marcus shoot lee alook of terror lee shoot a look to the roof on lee a he stand up into frame he ha almost physically transformed from a man into protection incarnate he slowly raise a stiff finger to his lip his body so tense it look painful this is the unwanted version of himself that lie just millimeter under his skin hour a day after a long moment nothing it would have happened by now lee finally nod that everything is ok marcus stare at regan with a painfully apologetic face a she lean in and touch his hand the whole family startle in silence something ha hit the roof second later a high pitched shrieeeeeek of claw sliding down the aluminum roof the family follows the sound exactly with their eye then silence lee crouch down and walk to a small window where the sound stopped above marcus wildly shake his head no evidence of his traumatic anxiety resurfacing regan slowly stand looking on with wide eye lee arrives at the window crouched from his low vantage point we can see the lip of the gutter and the eerily swaying christmas light lee begin to stand up slowly his face now virtually pressed against the glass suddenly a whir of screeching and growling a large shape a two raccoon hit the ground fighting then scamper off into the dark lee somehow exhales slowly and calmly a trick that no doubt took much practice and walk away from the window the two raccoon round the corner onto a moonlit path heading toward camera just a they come into close up head and then rip it out of frame we hold on the second raccoon running off with a soft but piercing scream it is night from high above we look down to the sand path between the red barn and the white farmhouse in the foreground we see the shadow of a telephone pole sitting on the wire in silhouette are bird from the ground we see the farmhouse in the distance but something is different the color seems wrong the angle is odd the foreground is over exposed and tiny dot fly in and out of the frame suddenly a giant foot step into frame and then another a we watch two bare foot then the hem of a dress and then the silhouette of evelyn walk silently toward the house we slowly pull back from that same shot of the farmhouse and reveal a plastic frame a red light button we realize this image is being viewed on a small monitor cctv footage from a security camera we continue to pull back slowly a another monitor come into frame with another stacked on top of it then one next to it and another until we reveal like something out of a dr seuss book a wall of tv all shape and brand sit on top of a large workbench covered with open notebook and sliced up newspaper on each screen we see element of tree sand path the barn the silo this is a diy version of a security console that overlook the entire farm and it ha taken a long time to put together we begin to track past the empty security console and onto a cinder block wall covered in note and newspaper clipping then suddenly a portion of one visible newspaper clipping show aclose up and much more detailed image of the enormouscrater the headline read a postit note stick to the clipping that read we pas by more clipping catching glimpse of dramaticheadlines and surreal image we pas by a grainy newspaper photo of a military standoff with one creature the headline read again we hear that familiar sound a it get louderwe continue to travel a a map enters frame like one youwould get at a gas station it is covered in illustratedforests and river it is a map of the state of new yorkthe portion above manhattan is covered in hand drawn redcircles and pin each accompanied with a date and namesof the deadwe move further along to reveal low quality still ofsecurity footage barely showing the creature each stillis drawn on and analyzed then a large white boardcovered in writing come into frame leaning against thewall amidst the scratch of written and rewritten thoughtswe can make out two list labeled question and in the question column are listed no demand no sign in the confirmed column are phrase like confirmed inpack do not attack small sound then we see the phrase we move to the very bottom of the white board where we seethe word weaponlisted below word are crossed out explosive we move off of the white board and scan past anatomical drawing of a shark sensing prey using magnetic field spectrum and finally image of the inner ear we now move through meticulously organized shelf covered in tool and wire and various piece of salvaged electronic equipment and finally onto lee back he is hunched over the workbench working intensely on something he is wearing large black headphone we see him reach out of frame a we we push past an old microphone that is connected to an old transatlantic ham radio in the glowing light from the box we see all kind of knob and needle below a switch labeled with two sticker that say radio and speaker lee hand come into frame and turn a large knob revealing the suddenly he press down on a button on the microphone we follow lee hand off of the button and onto a small soldering iron a he pick it up we go to lee at his workspace with magnifying glass in front of his eye he work with surgery like precision on a small contraption a small string of smoke rise from his work we are over the warmly lit from above stairwell with lee at his work station in the background a delicate bare foot touch down softly and deliberately on the step like a child knowing where to step so they dont wake their parent we boom up to reveal evelyn a she stare at her husband who hasnt heard her worried admiring lost a flicker of a memory echo through her face a she smilesand then walk to him evelyn is wearing ear budson lee a a hand touch down gently on his shoulder hedoesnt flinch at all there is immediate recognitionthere safety the hand then reach down and removelees headphone the sound of the searching radio in theheadphones is nearly inaudiblelee sits back and hold up a hearing aid it look like asomewhat common hearing aid but with handcraftedmodificationsupgrades there is a wire extension thatextends from the top almost like an adapter or plugthe hand gently grab lee face and turn it lee look upat evelyn who he now see is wearing lipstick ha pulledher hair back and ha changed into a beautiful dressthis is date night lee smile a evelyn take a stepback and with the gentlest of movement she sweetly beckonshim to herlee look back at his work for just a moment his face onceagain focused then he lay the hearing aid down on thetable and stand upwe hold on the hearing aid and then slowly pull back toreveal a pile of more hearing aid each with a variety ofdifferent modification scattered all around his work benchthis is something he ha been working on for a long whilewe tilt up from the workbench to see lee arrive at hiswifes side a she put her hand up on his neck and smile upat him warmly a if there is no where else to be nothingto make her happierface to face now lee finally allows a smile looking down athis time tested partnerevelyns eye close a she place her forehead to his and thetwo begin to gently sway in total silencesuddenly evelyn take lee hand from around her backand place them on her protruding belly after a moment shelooks up lovingly at her husband to see knowing this man inside and out evelyn keep her gaze firmlyinto her husband eye and slowly move her hand up leesarms and gently onto his face holding more than his visagein her hand lee finally look up at her evelyn smile with recognition of the man she married a her right hand travel to her right ear she remove the earbud from her ear and seamlessly place it in his a the only record on the record player this is the song they were married to this is perhaps it due to the lack of sound thus far in the movie or maybe the marrying image of the two dancing but the sound of the song are crystal clear we can perfectly hear every chord every tremor of vocal chord a we pull back on this perfect moment through the basement to the small rectangular basement window to reveal water hitting the glass we see a strong rain pouring down around the house a beautiful crisp morning from the porch of the farmhouse a water drip down from overhead we slowly travel along the sand path toward the barn when suddenly we arrive at a small stream of water cutting right through a now washed away segment of the sand path suddenly lee bare foot enter frame and then a large hiking backpack enters frame next to him on lee a we see a momentary glimpse into the painstaking and never ending workload that go into maintaining this farm close on hand a lee bare finger gouge into the unforgiving earth at the edge of the sand path to divert the water stone come into frame to form a temporary wall then lee hoist the very obviously heavy hiking bag onto his knee he then slowly and silently undoes a handmade flap at the bottom of the backpack from the opening of the bag pours sand quickly and silently sand pile up on the ground a we witness for the first time lee ingenious system that ha kept his family safe all this time close up of a gauge very faint burst of air can be heard we slowly pull back to reveal evelyn sitting on a hay bale with a blood pressure sleeve on her arm and a stethoscope in her ear behind her is a shelf full of bandage and iv bag she stop pumping the bulb stare down at the gauge and then gently let the air out and remove the sleeve evelyn mark her daily blood pressure on a calendar next to her on this calendar we see her estimated due date is week away after a moment she lean over and place the bottom part of the stethoscope onto her belly a faint sound of adjusting and then we creep slowly along the sand path heading toward the front door of the farmhouse suddenly regan step into frame walking deliberately a if tiptoeing regan reach the front door of the farmhouse and stop at the threshold a she look down at the worn wood floor scanning we can notice deliberately painted marking on the floor just then regan take a dramatically long step inside placing her foot down directly on the first colored marking silence looking almost relieved regan once again scan the floor and then focus on another marking she take another long step this time far to her right and touch down on the next marking silence it almost look like shes playing twister getting more confident she scan the room find another spot and step quickly we look directly up the basement stair toward the warm hallway at the top suddenly regan take a long step into frame her silhouette look down the dark stairwell after a moment she slowly put her foot down on the first step when suddenly close on regan a she is placed down onto the sand path a regan spin around we see lee kneeling in front of her you can not go down there you know why i wont make a sound im not a child lee pause that line sting just dont the two stare into each others eye communicating more than any sign language could suddenly lee reach up to her face his still dirty hand push the hair back over her right ear it seems so uncharacteristically warm and gentle when suddenly lee reach into his pocket with his right hand and pull out the hearing aid from the night before this time i wa able to use small amplifier from the stereo speaker to it wont work no our problem ha always been power but this should increase the frequency to it never work but well keep trying til it doe regan look up at him blankly a lee reach to bring the new hearing aid up to her ear when suddenly regan push his hand away lee reach up to her ear to try again regan push his hand away again giving him a cold stare with so much history behind it it a bizarrely heartbreaking altercation he try again she push again even harder lee look at his daughter a she look at him her venomous face betrayed by the large tear that roll down her cheek after a long moment regan snatch the hearing aid from her father hand and walk away on marcus back a he scribble in a notebook we go close to see marcus is writing in a math notebook his pencil suddenly pause move up the page through a long math problem and stop again suddenly a finger come into frame and point at a different part of the problem we pull out to reveal evelyn and marcus sitting in a small curated area with a desk book shelf and a white board covered in various phrase shape and equation we suddenly realize evelyn is home schooling him marcus suddenly nod and once again begin writing a evelyn look out the small door of the hay loft and down to the sand path below a lee arrives suddenly please dont make me go evelyn look over to see marcuss face awash with panic you will be fine your father will always protect you marcus grab her arm tight it startle her with tear in his eye he mouth to her please listen to me it is important that you learn these thing he just want you to be able to take care of yourself marcus look at her take care of me evelyn lightens the conversation by pretending to age in front of our eye when im old and grey evelyn lean on him marcus cant help but smile and i have no teeth evelyn pretending to have no teeth is too much for marcus to hold back his silent laugh over lee large shoulder we barely see marcus moving ever so slightly in one direction and then another on lee with a large hiking pack on his back he adjusts the strap of a backpack on marcus too tight marcus shake his head no good no i dont want to go lee look up at evelyn then back to marcus there nothing to be scared of of course there is suddenly behind lee we see regan appear ill go lee look over at his daughter and pause no no i need you to stay here and help your mother lee stand up to evelyn well be back before dinner i want to go just stay here youll be safe lee turn to evelyn who look at him with slight disappointment next time lee pause and then kiss evelyn lee and marcus walk down a sand path toward the wood evelyn turn to regan who is already walking away regan enters and throw the hearing aid her father made her onto the dirt floor this is the first time we have seen her bedroom it is sparse a hay bale covered in bed sheet a small crate with a neat pile of book inside and several candle on top a small wooden mirror leant against the wall regan drop to her knee on the ground we now see all kind of electronic equipment and tool architectural drawing are pinned to the wall it is like a mini version of her father work bench regan grab her pillow rip the pillow case off and begin furiously packing she grab clothes a water bottle a notepad and then the toy shuttle she get up to leave and then look back at the hearing aid on the ground close on regans profile a her hand come into frame and move to the hearing aid she currently wear suddenly a long wire is slowly pulled from deep in her ear canal regans eye wince with almost a snap of pressure a the wire come loose regan then gently feed the new hearing aid into her ear and pause suddenly regan click on the new hearing aid nothing we watch the thin veil of anger on regans face cascade into honest sorrow a regans eye squeeze shut brutal disappointment we pull out to see regan sitting quietly on the floor the quake of her shoulder betray her a we watch her cry after a moment she reach for a pillow case and exit from a distance lee lead marcus down a thin sand path that cut down the steep valley side and through the lush and learned evergreen of the mountain canopy marcus walk rigid like one would in the dark his saucer eye furtively clock every detail of his surroundings lee walk casually and confidently periodically turning to wait patiently for his son this is a day of teaching on marcus a lee put a hand quickly but gently on his son chest stopping him in his track lee focus down the path off marcuss quaking face peering around his father we too move around from behind lee to see a deer sitting in the middle of the sand path an adolescent buck it hold it impressive but still delicate antler upright and proud a it stare directly at lee and marcus an image obviously long thought impossible the moment carry a certain calm almost spiritual after a long moment the buck effort it way to it foot then turn and deftly step perfectly along the sand path and disappears close on the roof of the farmhouse water from the previous night storm still drip off the edge we slowly travel down the drainpipe running along the side of the house when suddenly the drain stop and we see pvc pipe ha been attached instead we continue along the pvc piping to the bottom where we see the pvc pipe bend and go from inside the shattered pane we now follow the pvc pipe into an old washing machine now filled with rain water suddenly a piece of clothing slowly come into frame and silently descends into the water we widen out to see evelyn place more clothes into a washer that is unplugged we see that she is simply using the corrugated tumbler inside a a wash board she remove a large plaid shirt just above the water line still inside the tumbler and squeeze it dry the action is virtually inaudible close up on a small pile of clothes being stacked onto other clothes then a cinch evelyn stand up over the newly packed cloth laundry bag then bend backward attempting to relieve a pain in her back when shes done she pick up the full laundry bag with one hand and another full laundry bag with the other evelyn struggle to the foot of the stair with the two bag and put them down she then take a deep breath look up the stairwell and begin to ascend again carefully placing her foot on specific spot on each step holding one bag a high a she can and dragging the second behind her it uncomfortable watching a fully pregnant woman traverse in this manner we go close on several stair a evelyns foot step up and drag the bag up the first step then the second her foot disappear a she drag the bag up onto the third it catch on a bent nail in the stair on evelyn not seeing the cause pull again and begin to she catch herself on the wall her eye lit up breathing heavily shes ok she quietly pick up the bag again and pull once more on evelyn satisfied a she drag the bag to the top of the stair and disappears we rack focus to reveal in the foreground close on bare foot walking along a sand path we boom up to reveal regan walking with purpose in her hand she carry a pillowcase inside the pillowcase an irregular shape after a moment she look up to the telephone pole sitting on the power line are more bird there is something buoyant about them something oblivious an immediate and jarring sound of water rush in a we are tight on moving water over rock we tilt up to the tall grass of a riverbed suddenly lee and marcus exit from the tree on marcus a he take in the picturesque landscape he ha never been here before suddenly his eye slowly move down to the ground close on his bare foot at the very edge of the sand path there is nowhere else to go marcus watch a lee take off his backpack and place it atthe edge of the river then he kneel down and looksintently into the water suddenly lee face softens hetakes one more look back at his son and then plunge hishands into the rivermarcus look on confused a his father seems to yank and pullat something suddenly lee hand burst out of the waterholding a handmade wooden contraption marcus start to backaway pulling that contraption out of the water definitelymade a sound marcus

back to the trout repeat big sound not unlesslees hand move to the moving water of the river repeat there is a constant sound nearby that is louder to mask it suddenly the trout flap again marcus look down then up to his dad his brain processing you know what lee check his watch then look up river then back to his son i want to show you something disoriented we move through a wall of dancing color then suddenly we see evelyn a she hold up a piece of clothing and pin it to a clothes line the scene is oddly beautiful a the clothes on the line dance we can suddenly see behind we track slowly along through the bannister of the upstairs hallway when suddenly evelyns head appears we continue with her a she slowly walk up the stair almost a if compelled a she ascends looking right past camera we get a clear look into the bedroom behind her in one room we catch glimpse of a pop music poster a pink desk and an empty bed frame in the next we see a nerf basketball hoop a life sized pokemon doll and half built lego strewn across the floor neither room ha door evelyn finally crest the top of the stair and walk out of frame a bizarre and beautiful image and sound light dance and bend through a cascading rampart we finally identify a a we pan over to see lee and marcus enter from outside and slide along the rock wall marcus look up to his father incredulous lee look down at him after a moment with a mischievous smile on his face marcus eye shoot up to his father immediately scared again his father look out at the waterfall and hoot again the way one would walking in a tunnel with their child lee turn to marcus and crouch down gently holding his trembling son shoulder youre alright we are on marcus face staring shaking somewhere between terror and wonderment i promise his father smile and nod comfortingly finally marcus meekly hoot his father head gently tilt a if to say you can do better marcus look back out the rushing water then back to his father and hoot loudly now thats more like it the smile on marcus and lee face can only be described a once in a lifetime we move slowly along a road panning down from gargantuan tree until we finally reveal regan walking towards camera suddenly coming into frame all around her is the bridge we follow regan a she walk across the bridge now more overgrown with weed and root then suddenly regan come to a stop and kneel down in sand a we continue to move back slowly suddenly coming into frame is the top of regan reach into her pillow case and pull out the toy we follow regans hand a she deftly remove one of the colored plastic piece underneath it quietly slide off to reveal a battery panel and several multicolored wire she reach into the front pocket of her dress and pull out plier and quickly cut the green wire regan reach into the pocket of her dress again and pull out battery she slide the battery in confidently we follow regans hand a they move to the base of the cross and place the toy shuttle in the sand we now see that the shuttle sits amongst a pile of other weathered toy and flower regan pausesand then flip the tiny switch but no sound we are tight on evelyns back a she walk through another doorless threshold a she continues into the room we begin to see the wall covered in rocket ship over evelyn a her eye stop on a cartoon mobile of the planet she tap it exactly a she tapped the mobile in the baby room this time watching it orbit around without a smile wide on the room for the first time we see the room is meticulous the bed is made the toy perfectly placed on the shelf close on the bed a evelyn sits down slowly light flood through the original paned window casting the shadow of a cross on the floor in front of her evelyn look over to the small night stand by the bed where a lamp and a hand made mirror sit suddenly she lift up the mirror and dust the table with the washcloth from the line evelyn stare out the window oddly at peace a lee ha his ritual atop the silo to contemplate on the irreversible loss of his son evelyn ha this evelyn keep her son spirit alive close on a water bladder poking into the rushing wall of water filling immediately we pull back and follow lee a he sits down on a rock next to his son and hand him the bladder marcus drink a lee look on a brightness washing over him this is a moment of calm a moment of family a moment of real life we follow the bladder a marcus hand it up to his father who happily take a large swig suddenly we hear why didnt you let her come with u lee look down at his son because i need to keep her safe is it because you blame her for what happened lee freeze instantly his heart stop finally he look down at his son in shock in awe because she blame herself lee eye blink and flutter a he try to gain control of his thought no i dont bl it wa no one fault you still love her right of of course i do pause you should tell her close on evelyn in the hand made mirror a she stare at the frame made up of colorful

she reach the doorway she stop her body tightens her face change her hand shake a it reach out to the side of the doorway we hold on her a moment and then go close on her foot rocking slightly in the doorway suddenly lee and marcus appear through an oddly beautiful exit from the wood and begin walking along a path profile on lee a we see the tall thin tree of a swamp behind him profile on marcus from the opposite side a swamp tree are also behind him suddenly a dilapidated house come into frame marcus turn to look marcus pov of the eery housethat stand a a reminder that people once lived here happily close on marcus looking up on the house his face now fearful suddenly behind marcus just out of focus in the short distance no sooner ha the figure exited frame marcus crash into marcus look up at his father who stare off sharply intothe short distanceover marcus a he slowly lean around his father to see whathes looking at when suddenly we see a human form unlike anything most of u ever will orshould get to see the man emaciated body quake and thenshudders a if a synapsis misfire his face is sunkenalmost ghoulish and the look in his pitch black eyescommunicates something far beyond fearful much worse thisis the rare look of a brain that ha accepted a livingnightmare a an everyday realityon marcus a he slowly raise his hand into a waveon the man who doesnt moveon lee a his eye travel slowly down the man frameon lee perspective a we see the man dirt covered facethen a ratty and ripped flannel shirt and then bloodcovered hand blood covered jean and finally at hisfeet in the high grass on lee a his eye slowly come back up to meet the manslee now also raise his hand and place a tense finger onhis lipson the man a two large tear run down his face in hiseyes the knowing fear of the end of his life a hetakes a deep breath inlee immediately grab marcustight on lee sprinting down the path carrying his son overhis shoulder the man in the background a bottomless sound of pain and surrender the soundblasts onto u like a wavelee suddenly dive behind a hallowed out tree trunk andthrows marcus back up against iton marcus a his father clasp his hand over his mouthmarcus eye widen a overwhelming panic take over on lee a he look down at his son with the most beautiful sense of calm the way one hold the hand of someone in their last second on earth lee smile is pure comfort pure love suddenly we hear the familiar terrifying screeeeeeeech on marcus who begin violently shaking his head his soul seemingly coming out through his skin then suddenly we hear the snapping of tree on lee a his look now shoot to the tree line behind the man when suddenly we hear the man primal scream of pain turn into an animal sound of death back on marcus a he cover his ear through the muffle of marcus covered ear we can still hear the most horrific sound of ultimate pain crunching and then a deafening marcus eye almost seem to dim right before u a he go limp from the floor we follow drop of fluid down the hall leading to evelyn gripping onto the railing with both hand a she slowly traverse the stair going down focusing intently on each step on evelyns face a she take slow deep breath her eye surging with panic and pain suddenly evelyns eye go wide close on evelyns belly a she slowly sink down into the step and into a close up in evelyns face we will witness many of u for the first time the complex and overwhelming sensory overload that is a contraction all swallowed back with every fiber of her being in order to remain silent just at the moment it look a though evelyn may explode the contraction subsides we are on evelyns back a she struggle up onto her foot and down the remaining stair a she round the banister and out of frame we hold on the front hall out the front door and onto the sand path warmly lit white from the christmas light above we are low looking up the basement stair a suddenly evelyn appears in the narrow doorway and grab hold of the wall still carrying the childrens mirror she take a moment and then begin to descend the exposed stair with the same deliberate effort coming towards camera evelyn get bigger and bigger in the frame until her head disappears then her belly just a her foot come down into close up we rack focus to the nail standing straight up evelyns foot step straight down on it we watch the nail pierce into the bottom of her foot and then erupt through the other side the sound cut out a we go close on evelyn a the shock and searing pain collides in her brain behind her eye then close on the mirror a it silently crash down the stair then rattle around in a circle before coming to a standstill on evelyn a full blown fear wash over her that sound wa most definitely heard she look down close on evelyns foot a she slide the foot slowly up the nail and pop it free blood immediately begin to drip from the wound evelyn rush down the remaining stair wincing with every other step we follow on evelyns back a she hurriedly shuffle through this basement that once felt familiar in the romantic glow of their slow dance but now feel stark and desperately lonely finally evelyn arrives at lee security console she desperately push past stack of notebook and file box of various electrical equipment like cellphone cassette player and egg timer that have been pillaged for part evelyn finally move the box of hearing aid to reveal that there on the wall is a large hand made switch evelyn grab the knob at the top and thrust it down suddenly flickering to life against the dusk colored sky like the white light before the power grid like system illuminates the farm in bright red regan lie in the sand next to the cross behind her we see red light through the tree regan doesnt see them on evelyn leaning on lee console her eye closed she take slow deep breathes a if to convince herself that it will all be ok now the signal ha been sent for a brief moment a smile a she then open her eye and move back to the stair a she clutch the support beam and go to take her first step up evelyn spin back away from the stair in terror a sky begin to settle into dusk above the towering tree lee enters carrying a limp marcus he trudge up the sand path looking down at marcus marcus eye are open but he is not present on lee back now a he and his son crest the hill we boom up to see the dark horizon line of sky give way to the top of the silo and then the fire red ground illuminated by christmas light on lee a we see his face register exactly what this mean he break into a full sprint close on one of the basement window a red light pours through we pull back slowly a evelyns hand enter frame she desperately push on the window nothing evelyn roams around the basement like a caged animal searching for any way out she move back to lee security console scanning the desk think think suddenly her eye fall upon the box of small electronics she just moved to get to the switch suddenly we hear evelyn freeze with fear then evelyn close her eye a the same sound that preempted her son death wash over her then her eye shoot open in pain larger than the second one this one brings evelyn to her knee her head dip to the ground a she grimace in intense pain close on evelyn a her head suddenly shoot back up the red light pouring in from the basement window cut a line across her face revealing her exploding eye trying to swallow the pain tear begin to fall she is unable to breath then suddenly air slowly escape a she exhales the contraction ha passed after a moment of realization disbelief she stand up and out of frame we hold and then slowly pan down to a small pool of blood on the floor now looking down the stair from the doorway in the first floor hallway we see evelyn rush through frame past the stair on evelyn a she quickly slide in behind a large boiler we can see the basement stair in the background evelyn squeeze her eye shut and begin murmuring to herself the nondescript sound is slightly louder a and then evelyns eye shoot open what now suddenly we are on evelyns face a she endures this immeasurable pain in this unthinkable moment then we hear whatever it is it coming down the stair evelyn crush herself even tighter against the wall behind the boiler closing her eye and exhaling in pure painful silence a the contraction subsides suddenly we hear evelyn turn and peer through the water tanksin evelyns pov a she scan the room through the sliver of aview then suddenlywe can barely make out more than a sliver of a creaturesshoulder or back from in between the tank we can see thatit is covered in small armor like plate suddenlythe small plate on the creature shoulder begin to liftup like the piece on a colander or an old satellitedish the small plate open up with the crackle and pull ofanatomical goo underneath then all of the sudden theplates begin to rotate like directional microphone theplates begin searching the room for soundfrom behind the tank evelyn watch a the creaturesplates turn toward the wall of monitor suddenly each ofthe screen begin to flicker then the picture goescompletely darkevelyn then suddenly roll her back against the tank to lookfrom one side of the room to the othersuddenly we now can identify the nondescript sound fromearlier a tickingthen sitting on a shelf on the wall opposite the console wesee when finally just a we land close up on the egg timer evelyn open her eyesthats it her plan worked evelyn thrust herself awayfrom the tankswe track with her a she move a quickly a she can to theexposed stair and begin to climb door suddenly evelyn burst out of the doorway from the basement we follow on her back a she maneuver her foot desperately from painted spot to painted spot down the hall to the front door and to freedom she grab the stair post for support a she cross through the front hall only step from the door when over her shoulder we barely see evelyn immediately spin around into close up a we now lead

blankly lee immediately dig into his back pack and pull out a lee place the flashlight in marcuss hand marcus look up to him with familiar panic in his eye lee then slide closer to his son and gently place his hand on marcus shoulder suddenly lee place his left hand straight up against his chest cross the finger of his right hand brings the two together and shoot his right hand into the sky this is the same exact sign his four year old son made in the general store at the beginning of the movie this mean rocket marcus shake his head no lee gently place his hand on marcus face and look directly in his eye no doubt informed by the heart opening day theyve had it is a beautiful moment of strength a lee communicates so much to his son first and foremost there is understanding and even an apology for the situation they are in but then the look turn to imploring your mother need help i need you to do this for her marcus look to his dad his eye change please and with that marcus is gone on lee a he watch his son run down the side of the barn and disappear around the corner he take a deep breath god protect his son god protect all of them lee turn and run around the barn from above we see evelyn enter the room carrying the thick blanket from the stair and turn on the bathroom light spot of blood smear on the floor on evelyn a she slowly get into the bathtub tear fall down her face a she reach over the wall of the tub and start stacking the blanket from her knee to her chest a she fold the last blanket over herself this time her eye go wide with the electric shock like

force from above we see evelyn in extreme pain but somehow keeping it all in suddenly a small stream of blood begin to trickle by her exposed foot lee rush into his room and reach under his mattress and pull out a shot gun not the first choice when trying not to make noise but he ha no other choice marcus walk down a thin sand path suddenly stop and look up to a huge overarching figure above him it is a watering device found in cornfield that tower high above the corn and roll slowly through the field on giant wheel on the bathtub all that can be seen are evelyns eye a she peer over the bathtub wall through the door and to the step suddenly we hear again just then the light bulb above evelyn begin to dim quickly back on evelyn a she begin to cry preparing for the end and then from above a evelyns face shoot to the sky with no affect her eye wide the rest of her face is calm then we see blood and fluid now pool around her foot a the light above her go out from only the light from the window we see evelyns face finally crack in pain her mouth open releasing the most guttural and now two person but right at that moment the scream of mother and baby are drowned out by a thundering we track with lee a he sprint down the sand path holding the shot gun like a civil war soldier rushing into battle a red green white large plume small sparkle falling down in the midst of this unthinkable nightmare it gorgeous huge burst of firework light up through the top of the towering tree regan sits up abruptly into the firework silhouette close on regan a the color illuminate on her face from the dining room we look into the front hall in the background suddenly from the doorway the muzzle of a gun poke through then moment later lee walk in stealthily moving the gun exactly where his eye point he clear the room on lee back a we look down the gun barrel he look to the dining room he look to the living room he look to the stair lee pov a he walk up the stair on each stair drop of blood to the left along the wall the wallpaper ha been intermittently ripped in three equidistant meandering through a doorway onto the now exposed wood floor landing with the bannister outlining the upstairs hall suddenly the top of lee head enters frame just a the creature had only moment before then his gun facing into the bedroom to the side lee move the gun confidently in all direction making sure the upstairs is clear a lee gaze come around to face directly at u his gun lower and we slowly pull back into the room to reveal the bloodstained edge of the bath tub on lee back a he rush to the tub to find just blood in an empty bath tub lee turn into his own close up profile a his back slide down the bathtub and onto the floor his hand release the gun to the floor his eye close and he begin to softly weep a mirror behind lee reflects the room back to him revealing for the first time a beveled glass shower door at the opposite end of the room suddenly a bloody hand hit the glass and the shower door slowly open over lee a he scramble to the shower and open the door stuffed inside is a quivering pile of blanket lee drop to his knee and pull back the blanket to see his wife pale with eye closed shes breathing and in her arm a sleeping newborn baby we hold on the top of the dense corn the creature like silhouette of the giant watering device looming a the last of a series of bottle rocket fire into the darkening night sky we move above the corn and then descend through it onto a thin sand path and onto marcus we follow with him a he safely walk back toward the barn holding his flashlight a the final burst of firework illuminate behind him on marcus face is genuine pride he know he ha done something heroic suddenly marcus frantically whip his light around the path behindhimwe follow his light a it scan the path and the stalkseven with nothing there it terrifyingjust then his flashlight begin to dim marcus whip his light around to the thin sand path in frontof him nothingsnap crunch snap crunch something else ismoving toward him fastmarcus turn around away from the barn and run weare on marcus face a he run scanning scanning marcus turn and begin to run into the corn cross right past lens the flashlight not able to castlight on anything thats not right in our face creatingalmost a strobe effect marcus is making a ton of on marcus face pure panic when suddenly we arriveinto a small clearing to see a tractor completelyovergrown with corn marcus immediately climb onto thetractor and frantically whip his light around theclearing and into the dense corn crunch something is moving toward him fast the lightbegins to flicker and then go outsuddenly off in the corn in front of him and for the firsttime we hear a loud screeeeeeeeeeeeeeech the lightsuddenly blare bright a all in an instant marcus fly back in fear slipping fromthe top of the tractor and slamming his head into the fade in the night is now dark we are behind regan walking a we are with her we are in she look around at the remnant of the last horrifying moment more reminiscent of a soldier returning to a battlefield then a girl returning to a farm we see countless streamer of firework smoke still falling gracefully from the sky the tip of dry cornstalk flicker alight with small flame off in the distance we see light of the silo shining like a beacon regan walk along the eerie shadow of corn stalk when suddenly at her foot crack of light regan lower to her knee and put her head to the ground to see a bright light cutting through the bottom of the stalk of corn suddenly the plier regan used to work on the toy shuttle slip out of the pocket of her dress regan doesnt even notice because she didnt even hear it regan sits back up to kneeling position when suddenly the cornstalk behind her begin to lay down a a shadow emergesat that exact moment we begin to hear the oddest and unpleasent beeeeeeeeeeeep suddenly regans eye begin to squint slightly then her hand slowly reach up to her ear suddenly the shadow move closer to regan and the beeeeeep grows now at a near deafening level we see the shadow behind regan stop regans face now scrunch up in agony a she grab her ear regan dig into her right ear rip out the hearing aid and launch forward regan suddenly kneel back up into frame the shadow is breathing wildly regan look at the hearing aid in her hand her face is almost electrified a excruciating a that wa that is the first sound she ha ever heard regan slowly put the hearing aid back in her ear nothing we follow regan a she walk down the small path leading to the clearing one ladder stand the other ladder on the ground bottle and firework litter the ground and then there in the center of the clearing lit by the flashlight one half of a deer carcass no sign of marcus regan slowly bend down to pick up the flashlight when suddenly the carcass move regan jump back terrified then from under the neck of the deer a hand regan run over and push the carcass off of marcus who ha been safely lying underneath covered in blood he scramble to try to get to his foot regan grab him and hold him tight she place her finger to her lip just like her dad she look around to see if they have a chance to run and then think better of it she look back to her brother and place her hand on his chest we rise above the clearing above the overgrown tractor and once again into the night we are wide on the farmhouse the red christmas light sway gently in the now calm night air after a long quiet moment lee appears at the doorway he carry evelyn in his arm the baby in hers he slowly descends the porch stair and begin to walk toward the barn his eye locked firmly on his cargo for a moment a lee walk this all feel almost like a dream or the end of a nightmare respite we are tight on evelyn who we see is unconscious from the trauma and the loss of fluid then down to the tightly wrapped baby sleeping in her arm lee look ahead to the door of the

corn creature and a the corn pours out the side the corn marcus sits atop begin to give way and slide toward the faintly the whirring sound slowly begin to fade back in and with it a muted boomboom tiny shaft of light begin to poke through our dark world a the sound grows boomboom suddenly the cascading corn is actually sliding away at such a fierce rate that it unearths regans face a it pop out from the corn regan take in the deepest breath of air her lung can handle low on a sand path cutting through thick cornfield on either side a lee round the corner and sprint a fast a he can his flashlight thrash through the night sky on marcus a he wrap his arm around his sister and pull her up to the steel door on regan sweating breathing heavily she look to marcus who is looking away

to shake her head then wave her arm a best she can no no no but lee doesnt see her lee begin to walk slowly toward the silo we are over the stair looking through the basement to the monitor suddenly a dripping wet foot step into frame and then another a evelyn descends the stair holding the baby through the rearview mirror we see reflection of lee flashlight a it scan up and down the silo behind on marcus a the dim light reflects onto his closed eye and he wake up in the rearview he see the flashlight and immediately spin to look out the window at his father standing only yard from the hole the smallest whisper dad no no overcome with fear marcus instinctively slide to the driver side door and open it a the driver side door wrench open the age of the truck and the year without use become painfully evident a almost transported back to that fateful day on the bridge we watch a lee head slowly turn a he raise his light onto the truck and his son then just a he did on the bridge knowing what come next lee run regan roll out from under the car grab her brother and safely tackle him into the car closing the door behind them regan put her brother down onto the floor of the truck

can hear the full sound of the violent attack from underneath the truck we see the front wheel slide forward in the sand the front wheel slide again this time they begin to disappear over the edge of the clearing and down the long driveway on regan and marcus a she hold her brother and look around the cab for option suddenly out the passenger side window she see glass shatters and the truck lift up on lee back sprinting now only twenty yard away when he see the right side of the truck lift high into the air for a moment it look a though it is going to tip all the way over then smash back down to the ground we now bear witness to something eerily familiar a lee we circle around lee a his foot scrape to a stop his we end our move on lee face a he scan the smashed truck his eye seem to actually flicker a his brain fire and misfire trying to process this nightmare this loss when suddenly on regan jammed down into the floor of the passenger seat she reach over to her brother and lift his head marcus open his teary eye shaken but alive regan slowly rise up onto the seat and through the smashed window we are close on lee a he register this miraculous sight of his daughter and watch
