Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes          sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in.          In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his          mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of          WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he          finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA          FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap.           Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the          one who told me not to mess up the          precious picture piles!          he gives him a long, slow kiss.           Minty fresh.           That was nice.           It was nice.           Hey from now on when you change the          toilet paper, could you just make sure it          is out?            Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's          over!           Oh, believe me, we're just getting          started, Phil.           (reaches into picture pile)          Look at this one of your Mom with me. I          mean that woman can't contain her 'Love!          ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands          stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle          deep in a manure bin.            She just takes a while to warm up. You          guys are gonna be best buddies. You          picked a favorite of us yet?                                      Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara.           That's exactly the one I picked!          Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed.          It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look          joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front          of them.           Man, I wish I was them.          Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades          as she stares at the picture. He notices.             I just... when I was growing up my Mom          and Dad had a picture just like this.          Now they can't even acknowledge each          other.          Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.           Let's always remember to have some time          that's just for the two of us. No matter          what else comes up in our lives - if it's          work or friends or when we have kids-           We're having kids? With an ""S""?           OK fine. But I promise you it's never          gonna happen to us.           Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that          when I'm long in the tooth.           You'll be even hotter long toothed.          Right now to be honest Clara they're a          little stumpy.            Oh really?          As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and          turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of          pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.                                                                                                               Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures.           wasn't the pictures.           You know how long that took?           We'll fix the picture piles, Clara.          We've got all the time in the world.          From now on everything's gonna be just          about us.          Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.            The Talking Head's ""Once in a Lifetime"" kicks           Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an          ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am.            Mo-om!          It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan          in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER          while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a          T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each          side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite          directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the          hall and Phil to the bathroom.           Mom! Mom! Mom!           I'm coming, Ollie!           As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's          bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil          showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the          doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack          of PAPERS in his hand.           Uh Phil?                                                                                                               Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers.           Yep?           I need to switch. I've got an open          house.          Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but          contains it.           Really?           Yeah. Really.          As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands          together.           OK, so I say today we go for the slacker          look - cool yet approachable.           Yeah, well Mom says that.          Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.           Oh. Well... that's cool too!           The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly          through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin          SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open.          She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then          stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing          a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror.          As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as          well.           Ech. Mine.          She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts          brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of          razor hairs and bits of toothpaste.          Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to          discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and          shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.                                                                                                               Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the          holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT.          As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fad           Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as          Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits          at the table. Phil finally notices.           What?           Breakfast?            Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob          today. What's it gonna be?          Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign          of his tom.           How about... some Captain Crunch?          Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.             Captain Crunch?The cereal?           Uh... yeah. Sure.          Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out          cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed          in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.           Ah ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a          bowl yesterday.           But Dad already said yeah sure.          Clara glances at Phil.          said it. I said it                                                                                                                  Yeah, sure! You know it's only one bowl             A week.           One bowl a day a week.          Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already          in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.           This is not for you today!            Yeah right.            Worth a try.           Did you get his lunch together?           Oh. Whoops.            You just get his breakfast and I'll do          it.          As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie          and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton. Peeking          back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the          phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch. He          stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly          returning the carton to the fridge.            Hey Jane? I'm getting a late start but          I'll be there as soon as I can.           Sorry I dropped the ball. It's this          Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today.          You know how he freaks me out with all of          his mixed animal metaphors that I don't            (focusing on Ollie's lunch)          Ollie, do you want a banana?                                                                                                                Did you hear me?           (not looking at him)          Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed          animal metaphors that you don't          understand. Banana Ollie?            So I should probably get going. With the          highway construction it takes forever to          get downtown these days.           OK. Have a good day.          Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it          off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly          kisses Phil on the cheek.           Sorry. Your mouthy was still ail milky.           Sorry for the milky mouth.          He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1�1          dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink,          then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk          in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her          head, she tosses the carton in the trash.           As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport          next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks          a newspaper off his lawn.           Well, well! We're up bright and early,          aren't we!           Yes we are!          (under his breath)          ike you say to me every morning.          Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and          Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'          car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few          inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING          STUCK halfway.                                                                                                                 Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and          peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room.          Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger          side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the          front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear          and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's          seat.            The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD          CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of          it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his          window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in          slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR           HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his          watch.            Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her          30's, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW          SIGNS on the sidewalk.           His name's Juan and he's some kind of          Spanish, I think. He knows all these          exclusive, underground places downtown.          It's so exciting. And in bed...           I never knew I could still get my leg          back that far.           Too much information, Jane.           Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each          move quickly around different parts of the vacant home,          cleaning and inspecting.          The divorce was the best thing that ever          happened to me. Seriously. You know          that great nervous feeling in your          stomach? Where you don't know what's          going to happen next?                                                                                                               On her way down the hall, Clara spots a mark up ahead on          the wall. She reaches into her large purse and pulls out          a mini-409 mister and a rag. With the aim of a          SHARPSHOOTER, she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she          passes.           With Larry, I lost that. Everything had          just become routine, you know? Boring.          Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through          the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a          weird, loud buzzing noise.           But now, all of a sudden I'm alive again!           Good for you, Jane.          Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki          the side and silencing it.           Good for you.            Clara and Jane sit on the floor, together          prospectuses.           There's this g---eat restaurant downtown we          went to the ot__ar night that you guys          would love. _""st amazing view of the          city. You guys should check it out on          your next date night.           (focusing on stapling)          Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have          those that much anymore.           't have date nights:           (shrugs),          You know, we're pretty tired all the time          between work and Ollie. And some of the          shows on TV these days are really great.          Ah. I see.                                                                                                                They staple in silence for a second. Jane and Clara look          at each other.           I know that's really lame.           So it's Phil?            No, it's not Phil. It's the both of us.          I don't know. It just... happened.           So why don't you change it? All you have          to do is stir things up and have one          great, sexy, exciting night again.           I guess. Maybe.           Not maybe. Tonight.           Nah. Tonight's no good.            Why not? Seriously think about it.          What's really gonna be more important          tonight than that?          Clara takes this in. Jane's right.           Checking his watch, Phil shakes his head as he rushes          through the large bullpen of the Chicago Mercantile          Exchange. In the pits all around him, BUYERS and SELLERS          scream out their orders.           In a dark wood office with STUFFED AR '� L HEADS lining          the walls, a young, smartly dressed man in his 20's,          GEORGE, quietly goes through a binder with MR. RIVERS,          60, at the older man's desk. As Phil bursts in they both          look over.           I'm sorry I'm late. The construction on          the highways is insane these days!                                                                                                               Don't worry about it, Phil. It's fine.          Catch your breath.          George gives Mr. Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake, then          heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil. Phil nods          back warily, then takes out his binder, ready to launch          into his report.           Uh, Phil. Listen, before we start...          I've been thinking... this next quarter          we need to venture into open tundra.          Start really ripping the meat.           (beat, trying to decipher)          Uh. OK. You mean... take the fund in a          more high risk direction?           Yeah. That's wha: I - -aid.          Sure. OK, fine. I can work up some          higher risk options and come back          tomorrow.             OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want          George to give me his thoughts on where          we need to be hunting too.           Oh.           s nothing personal.           So let me get this straight. You're          telling me that tomorrow I'm going to          have to interview for the job I already          have? Against George?           I wouldn't put it like that. I Just need          our pack leader to be more like... like a          momma kangaroo. Ya get me?           Kinda.           Actually, no. Not really at all.                                                                                                                The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth          and knows its momma's teat is just always          there, ready to suckle. But at the same          time, momma kangaroo's still a wild,          dangerous creature.           Sorry. Still not totally getting you.           I've had a wife and a family. Three of          them. It's hard to stay the fastest          cheetah when you need to mind the pack,          Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't          have a family to worry about. He can rip          the meat.           Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to...          I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat          and eating them like tartare when George          was still... in the jungle!            What does that mean?           I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just          can't.           Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta          say that lately your leadership on this          has felt a little... well... tame.            That's all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers!          I'll see you tomorrow.          Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River's office.           Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from          school.            So it's OK if we drop him off at 7? Our          reservation's at 7:45.          She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a          Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose.                                                                                                               Without breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and          hands the grateful mother a tissue, then takes out a mini-          bottle of Purell and cleans her hands.            Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it.           Mrs. Foster?          Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned          MRS. CARDIGAN, 45, walking toward her in the parking lot.           Oh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you          later.          Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a          warm smile.           I've been meaning to tell you that you          can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan.           I'd prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries          matter.             Can we speak a moment? Alone?           Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car.          As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan.           Is everything OK?           Well, I'm afraid not. Oliver's been          antagonizing the girls in the class a          great deal lately. Especially Jenny          Diggs.           Really? Oh no. Why do you think that's          happening?           I'm going to leave that to you and your          nd to figure out. But beyond that,          ,i: overall attitude these days is          just... sub par. E                                                                                                                 His penmanship is sloppy. He lacks          motivation and tries to just ""get by"" o          assignments. You know, this is a very          competitive school, Mrs. Foster. In my          opinion, maybe you should consider          whether this is really the right          environment for him.           (beat, stunned)          Uh... wow. OK.          Mrs. Cardigan starts away. Clara climbs into the car,          watching Mrs. Cardigan.           (under her breath)          Wow. What a bitch.           Did you just call Mrs. Cardigan a bitch?           (remembering Ollie's in the           No.           Yeah you did.            I didn't. I really didn't.          Clara quickly pulls out.           Phil SQUEEZES out of his drivers seat with folders full          of RESEARCH. As he walks toward the house he spots the          TONS of room on the other side of Clara's car and shakes          his head.           Unbelievable!           Still carrying his research, Phil peeks in on Ollie, who          packs a suitcase.           Hey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta          tell you it's about time.            I'm going to Nana's tonight.                                                                                                                On a school night? Why?            Mom says you guys are going out.           Tonight? What? No.           Clara?           Phil marches into the bedroom.           Clara? Cl-          He stops in the doorway as he spots her. Made up in an          evening dress in front of a full length mirror, Clara          looks STUNNING as she finishes putting an earring on.           Wow. Wow.          Clara tns and smiles.            I thought I could take you out to          celebrate you finally getting that report          in. A romantic dinner downtown like the          old days, and teen...          (raises :,er eyebrows)           Ollie's going to stay at Mom's so we have           the house all to ourselves. All night.           Wow... It sounds... great.           Great!          She turns back and continues getting ready.           It's just... is there any chance we coul          take a rain check?            A ""rain check""?           Yeah. Unfortunately I really need to do          a bit of work tonight. E                                                                                                                I thought all the cramming was for this          report today. Did something go wrong?            Uh, no. Nothing like that. I just          decided I could play with it a little          more. Make it a little better.          Clara takes him in a moment.           Oh. OK.          Controlling herself, Clara starts putting her jewelry          back in the case.           Listen, I'm sorry...           You don't need to apologize, Phil.           Listen, if I had more warning-           Then something else would have come up.          You know it. That's the thing, Phil. We          used to do things on the spur of the          moment all the time. Even after Ollie          was born. Now we never do anything          together.          They stare at each other, then Phil breaks           Listen... any other night.           OK. Maybe another time. Let me just get          out of this and call my Mom then.          As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her,          feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around          the room, Clara's SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their          romantic night. He looks down again at the papers in his          hand and sucks in, conflicted.           As Clara starts to take her dress off, Phil scoots past          her, humming to himself. She looks over to see him          choosing a tie and jacket from his side. Clara looks          him, still unsure.                                                                                                                That dress really wasn't playing fair,          Clara.          With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie.           Well get a move on, girl!          She zips her dress back up.            RUTH, Clara's mother, opens her front door and brightens.           (to Clara and Ollie)          Hey sweeties.           Phil.           Ruth.           Nana rented us a special treat tonight          before bed, Ollie! The Wizard of Oz!           Wow. Wizard of Oz. Don't you think          that's a little scary for a 5 year old?           (not looking at him)          No, Phil, I don't.           OK... not so sure about that.            Clara? What do you think?           (putting her pressure on)          Yeah, Clara. What do you think?                                                                                                                Phil's flustered as he and Clara head out the door          towards Phil's car.           I'm sorry, Phil. I just felt like she's          doing us a favor tonight.           fine. Fine.          oust as they climb into the car, Clara stops.           You know, I should pee before we go.            OK. Sure.          As Clara runs back to Ruth's house, Phil plops down in          the driver's seat.           I'll just wait in the car as you go back          E inside to pee. Again.           As the sun sets, Phil and Clara sit in BUMPER TO BUMPER          TRAFFIC. It extends for MILES toward the center of the          city.           Phil turns on the air conditioner and adjusts the vents.           You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor          Diggs. Tries to widen all the highways          to get reelected, but all everyone's          going to remember when it's time to vote          is all this mess.            You're hot?           Yeah. That's why I turned on the air.                                                                                                                  Clara shuts the passenger side vents which causes AIR to          GUST out of Phil's vents, into his face. He glances at          Clara, oblivious, then reaches over and turns down the          air.           You know, Mrs. Cardigan told me today          that Ollie's been antagonizing his          daughter.           Antagonizing? How does a five year old          ""antagonize?"" I'm sure she wouldn't have          mentioned it if it wasn't ""the Mayor's          daughter.""           She also went on that Ollie's          penmanship's sloppy and he's not          motivated enough.           (trying to make a joke of          Got all my best traits, huh?          He looks over to see that Clara looks out of the wiF n,,          not responding - a response in itself. He sucks in.           I think he's fine.           She actually had the gall to suggest we          should think about sending him somewhere          else.           Maybe she's right if the school has that          kind of attitude.          Clara's about to object bit stops herself and takes a          breath, playing affection-.-ely with the back of Phil's          hair.           You know what? All we ever end up          talking about is Ollie or work. Let's          just focus on us tonight.            Great. I'm all for tha          Beat. They sit in silence in the traffic.                                                                                                              Ga.           So what are you thinking about?           Right now? Traffic.           Oh. Well, I heard this unbelievable          story from Jane today.           Yeah?           She has this old classmate who went into          labor with her second child the other          day. She's totally healthy and          everything's normal with the pregnancy.          So she goes into labor and walks into the          emergency room, and the second the nurses          and attendants see her come in, they go          into a panic and start yelling A,LA! ATMiA!            What's AMA?           Advanced Maternal Age!            No! You've got to be joking me!           kid you not!           That's unbelievable!           I know.          Beat. Clara looks out the window.           The funny thing is she's my age,          actually.          Suddenly, Phil's smile fades as he realizes the possible          ulterior motive.           Huh.                                                                                                                 Clara picks up on his change and figures out what he's          thinking. A bit flustered, she opens her vents again.          Phil looks over at her.           I thought you were cold.           I was, but then you turned it down and I          got hot.           But I turned it down because... you see          when you open and close your vents it          makes my... never mind.          Phil reaches over and turns up the air again. Tapping          his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he gets fed up,          suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding          toward the exit.           What are you doing?           I'm just gonna take a shortcut.           Phil, please don't. You think they're          shortcuts but they always take longer.          And we're already-           Clara, please just trust me, OK          They zoom ahead for a moment in silence. Frustrated,          Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a POWERFUL GUST          OF COLD AIR onto Phil's face. Biting his tongue, he just          leaves it blowing on him as they drive.           Phil and Clara rush off the elevator and enter the          Signature Restaurant on the 95t Flcor of the John          Hancock Center, with dramatic s- Lng views over          skyline of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan.           I promise you it wouldn't have been any          faster. I promise!          OK, Phil. Will you just tell them we're          here? I'm gonna go pee.                                                                                                                 Now?           What?           Nothing.          As Clara hurries off, Phil, shaking his head, makes his          way through the crowds to the SUPERMODEL HOSTESS.           Good evening. Welcome to the Signature          Room.           Thanks. The name is Foster.           Foster... Oh, I'm sorry. We just had          give away your table.           You gave away our table? We're just ten          minutes late!             Actually, you're 11 minutes late.            OK. But don't you guys have, like, some          kind of grace period or something?           have an eight minute grace period.           You have an eight minute grace period?          How did you come up with an eight minute          grace period?            I just work here,           So what if someone's 9 minutes late?           We're allowed to give a two minute grace          on the grace.                                                                                                                OK. Which adds up to ten minutes! We're          11 minutes late. That's just one minute          later than the grace on the grace.           I'm sorry sir, but management          specifically said no grace on the grace          on the grace. After ten minutes, we send          a host around calling your name and if          there's no answer, we give the table          away. Sorry.           So how long's the wait for another table?           Well, let's see...          Phil looks on as the Supermodel Hostess runs her finger          down a LONG LIST OF WRITE-IN NAMES. As she turns to the          next page...           Oh boy.           Even the bathroom has sweeping views of Chicago. As          Clara leaves a bathroom stall, she notices a NERVOUS          YOUNG WOMAN washing her face over and over.          A knock and a SLICK LOOKING MAN quickly peeks his head in          the Women's room.           We've gotta leave now.           Whoops. Sorry.           It's OK.          The Nervous Woman quickly leaves the bathroom with the          Man. Clara looks after them a second, then washes her          hands.            Clara finds Phil at the bar, downing handfuls of peanuts.           How lc= -until they seat us?                                                                                                                Two hours. They gave away our          reservation. Peanut?           What?!? Did you tell them that we hit          traffic?           They wouldn't care, Clara. If they call          your name at the bar and you don't          answer, they give your table away. So          how about a nut?          A YOUNG HOST (not the Hostess) mills around the bar.            Clara sighs, frustrated.           I mean, did you try something like          telling her it was our anniversary, or my          birthday, or slipping her some money-           Oh, I see. Lying and graft were the          answer!          Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST          searching for the party and starts focusing on him          instead of Phil as she thinks.             I'm sure if you had been there instead of          peeing again you would have done it          better.               You're not even listening to me, are you?           (repeats, still watching)          Yeah I am. You're sure if I had been          there instead of peeing again I would          have done it better.                                                                                                               Clara, Just because you can repeat the          words I say doesn't mean you're-             Sorry! We're right here!           Wait. What are you doing?           Shhh!          The Young Host approaches.           Gale party of three?           The third's running a little          going to start without them.           eat. Follow me.          Phil shoots Clara a look, but she ignores it. He falls          into line after her as she follows the Young Host to th          restaurant.           hields his face as they pass the Supermodel Hos          at the Greeting Station. The Young Host leads them          secluded table right by the windows - THE BEST TABLE            (handing them menus)          Enjoy your dinner.          The Young, Host leaves.           See? Was that so hard to do, Phil?          bad to be the Gales, eh?          Clara opens her menu as looks nervously around the          restaurant.           Look Phil! It's white truffle season!          I'm totally doing it!                                                                                                                 We can't do this, Clara.           I'm taking you out.           Not the truffles.           This is stealing.            Stealing? You're kidding, right.           We're not the Gales.           So? You said yourself - if you don't          answer at the bar they give your table          away.           Well, what if they show up now?           u get spanked'           I'm serious!            I don't know. What if they do, Phil?          Clara picks up her menu and reads, shaking her head.           What?           It's just... I don't know. You used to          be the one who would think up stuff like          this all the time.          This hits Phil. He takes in his wife reading the menu          for a beat.           You know what? You're absolutely right.          Clara lowers her menu and they look at each other for          what feels like the first time tonight.           I'm sorry, Mrs. Gale.                                                                                                                  It's OK, Mr. Gale. And might I add you          look very handsome tonight?           You're not looking too shabby yours          Mrs. Gale.           Mr. Gale?          They turn, surprised, to see TWO BURLY MEN in suits at          their table. The Older of the two politely speaks to          them.           We need to have a word with you both.           What's this about?           k you know what this is about.          you could please come with us.           Why can't we talk here? u           (beat, smiles)          I think it would save everyone a lot of          embarrassment.          (gestures with hand)          Please...          The Younger Burly Man comes behind Clara's chair to pull          it out. Getting up, Phil shoots Clara an ""I told you so""          look as he follows the older Burly Man through the          restaurant toward the kitchen doors, the Younger Burly          Man walking behind them with Clara.           The Burly Man leads them through the kitchen. A WAITER          stops, surprised.           Can I help you?          OLDER s _ �'LY MAN          Nah. We're fine ®          Walking to the rear service elevator, the Older Burly Man          pushes the down button. The elevator opens.                                                                                                                Whoa. Wait a minute. Where are we          going?           Get in, please.          The Younger Burly Man coming up behind them crowds them          into the elevator.           Hey! Jesus!          The elevator doors shut and the older Burly Man pushes          the G Floor then nods to his partner. They reach in          their pockets.           Listen, this is all getting out of hand,          OK? I admit we maybe did something a          teeny bit wrong, but-          Suddenly, they grab Phil and Clara, putting HANDKERCHIEFS          over their noses and mouths. Phil and Clara veil and          struggle for a moment, then PASS OUT.           An AMMONIA STICK waves back and forth under Phil's nose          and he startles awake, disoriented, to see he's TIED TO A          CHAIR in the middle of a GIGANTIC MEAT LOCKER. A VIDEO          CAMERA on a tripod aims at their faces and across the          room, the Younger Burly Man sorts through items from          Clara's purse and Phil's wallet scattered all over the          table.           Whoa. What the hell is this?          Tied in the chair next to him, Clara jumps as the Older          Burly Man waves the stick under her nose.            Phil?!? What's going on?           I don't know.          A VOICE speaks from a speakerphone on the table           The chloroform may make you feel dizzy          for a few moments, but it will go away.                                                                                                                Phil takes in what's going on, freaked.           Listen... you can just have all our          money, OK? Whatever's there, it's yours.          We're not looking to cause problems or          put up any kind fight. We'll just walk          away and not report anything, OK? All we          want is for you to let us go unharmed.           We need to discuss your little stunt          tonight first, Mr. and Mrs. ""Gale."" Or          should we say... what is it Harry?          HARRY, the Younger Burly Man reads Phil and Clara's IDs,          which he's grabbed off of them.           Phil and Clara Foster.            That's what this is abo           else would it be about, Mr. Foster           Wait. `'This a joke, right? Some funny          little bald guy's gonna jump out and          scare us and say, ""Gotcha!"" or somethi          OK, where is he? Where's that guy?           You think this is a joke?          Phil looks at the faces of the two thugs. No one's          joking.            No. Are you insane?!? You don't drug          people and tie them up for that! This i          I just- I hope you know this is gonna go          way beyond a shitty review in Za          I'm seriously pissed off!           SHADOWY FIGURE talks on a phone as he looks at a screen          showing Phil and Clara in chairs.                                                                                                                  Yes. Well, I'm a little upset as well,          Mr. Foster. And confused. It would help          me to know why a couple like the two of          you would try to pull something like          this.           Phil's now getting really annoyed.           You must be kidding! Like a million          people don't do it every single night of          the week! This is unbelievable! I'm          just in shock here!          Harry and Frank look at each other, puzzled.           I enjoy your humor, Mr. Foster. Now why          don't you start by telling me how you got          into the Rainbow to set it uD-           ""Into the Rainbow?"" What the hell's          that? Restaurant code?            -and then you can tell me where the          photos are that you arranged to bring          tonight.           Photos?          Clara figures out what's happened.           Wait a minute. I think there's been a          really big mistake here. We're not the          Gales.           know you're not the Gales.           They know we're not the Gales. Don't you          get it!           No, Phil. I think they think we're          actually ""the Gales"" who made the          reservation tonight.                                                                                                                 Ohhhhhh. Oh. No. She's right. We're          not those Gales. You've got the wrong          people. Really.           Then why were you two at the Gales'          table, Mr. Foster?           OK, listen, what happened is we lost our          reservation and when the host came around          yelling the Gales' name and no one          answered, my wife said that we were them.          I swear on my life to you that's what          happened.           You're saying you just took someone          else's reservation you didn't know?          That's what you want me to believe?           I know that seems really weird. Listen,          I agree, that's what I said to her.           One problem with your story. When I came          over to the table - and you guys were all          alone - you were still calling each other          Gale.           That was just... we were... no, you don't          understand...           We'll need to move things along, Frank.          With a nod, Frank reaches into his pockets, slowly taking          out a GUN and a handful of BULLETS. He loads the gun as          Phil and Clara watch.           Wait a minute. What's going on?           I don't t don't like          this.          Clicking the loaded gun, Frank and Harry both come toward          Phil and Clara.                                                                                                                 If in ten seconds you don't tell us where          the photos are, you lose a knee, Mr.          Foster. Ten more seconds, you lose          another. Then we go to your wife.           Please! You can't do this! We're not          lying!           One... two... three... four...          Frank clicks the loaded gun at Phil's knee.           Oh Jesus. Don't do it!           Five... six... seven... eight...           Jesus!              Everyone looks over. Phil's surprised.           But we can't just tell you where they          are. We have to take you to them.           In the middle of the deserted warehouse district, Clara          and Phil exit the meat packing plant behind Frank, who          carries Clara's purse, Harry holding a gun as he follows          them. As they head toward a Towncar, Frank throws the          keys back to Harry.           You drive with her in front.            So what's your plan here?            I don't have a plan Phil.            You don't have a plan?                                                                                                                 No. I was just trying to keep our knees          for the time being.            Well, if we end up in that car with them          we're as good as dead.           Quiet!            Well, any time you want to help...            What's that supposed to mean?           I said quiet!          They continue walking toward the Iowncar, Phil thin ing          hard. Suddenly, his expression changes and he star s          weaving dizzily, putting his hand to his forehead.           Phil?          He drops to the ground.           Whoa.           Phil? What is it?           I'm... not feeling so great...           's wrong with him?           I don't know.            I didn't... eat dinner and when I don't          my blood sugar... Hypoglycemic...           You're not hypoglycemic.          Phil shoots Clara a quick LOOK OF                                                                                                                 You're diabetic! You never get the terms          right, Phil! Oh no! This is bad, guys.           I just can't... go any further.          Harry and Frank look at each other, not sure what to do.           Should we call Mr. Stockton?           Don't say his name, you idiot!           Sorry! I was just-           We'll just throw him in the back and have          her show us.          hey move over to pick up Phil. Clara thinks fast.           Wait! In my purse there's a Luna Bar.          If you give it to me I can find it for          him.          With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her purse. She rummages          inside...          and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing          Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back          grabbing his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a          dash and grabs it. As Frank blindly lunges after her,          she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on the ground,          whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at          Harry.           Drop the gun and the keys.           oa! Clara! No          Harry drops them, raising his hands. Phil gets up and          grabs the gun and keys, then awkwardly hits Harry as hard          as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the          gun.          Harry looks at him, confused.           Ow! Why, man?                                                                                                                 Sorry. i was trying to knock you out.           Why,           ought that's what you do when-           Phil! Just c'mon!            Sorry.          Befuddled, Phil meets Clara at the car and they climb in          and speed away.           OK, let me just start from the very          beginning...           Phil excitedly chatters next to Clara at a table in an          interrogation room in the police station. Across the          table, a YOUNG POLICE OFFICER takes their statement           We got to the restaurant late because we          hit all this traffic on the highway-           the shortcut.           What?            I just think we might have made it on          time if we stayed on the highway. Your          shortcuts end up being long cuts most o          the time.           OK, are you going to tell the Policeman          or and I gonna tell him?           You can tell him.                                                                                                               Because you always interrupt me when I          try to tell stories, and every time you          do it disrupts my flow.           Fine, you tell it. I won't say another          word.           Fine.           See, now I've totally lost where I was.           You got to the restaurant late-           Yeah. Even using my shortcut which, by          the way, was a shortcut - and they gave          away our reservation. So we were at the          bar and the host was calling out for          these other people over and over-           Which is what they do right before they          cancel a reservation anyway.           I thought you said you weren't going to          interrupt me, Clara.           I just want him to understand we weren't          really ""stealing"" someone else's           Across the table, the Young Police officer, eyebrows          raised, watches Phil and Clara volley back and forth.           Do you think he really cares, Clara?          were just kidnapped, CHLOROFORMED and          almost shot! I don't think he's going          turn around and book us for reservation          theft! Am I right?           Please. Go on.           So all of a sudden Clara yells out that          we're these other people.            You just took someone else's reservation?                                                                                                                Yeah. I know! Even the guy on the          speakerphone couldn't believe it!           You two kinda bonded over that, didn't          you?           We didn't ""bond"" over it. I'm just          saying, speakerphone guy obviously          thought it was weird to do.           Guys, you lost We were in the          restaurant.            Ah, you mean the speakerphone guy who's          kidnapped and drugged us thinks it's          weird to do so it's weird to do?           Guys?          You're new ""buddy.""           Oh c'mon!          And we found out speakerphone guy's name,          Phil. It's Mr. Stockton.          The Young Policeman looks up, interested.           Mr. Stockton? Hold on a minute.          The Officer dials an extension on the phone.           Lieutecant Manning? �eeird story. Havea          couple '.n here who claim --o have escaped          a kid- 7-ng this evening and the name          Stockt came up. OK. Will do.          He hangs up.           Lieutenant Manning likes to be notified          ere's anything involving Mr.          n.                                                                                                                 Wait. So you already know about this          guy? You know who he is?          A knock at the door and a handsome man in his late 40's,          LIEUTENANT MANNING, enters the room with a smile. He          reaches over and shakes their hands.           How do you do. Lieutenant Manning.          The Officer offers him his note pad.            Nah, as long as they're here might as          well get everything from the horse's          mouth, right?          As the Officer heads out of the room, Lieutenant Manning          sidles down into his seat.            Can I get you guys anything to drink?          Coffee? Water? Maybe a shot or two of          r whiskey?            That sounds more like           So why don't you tell me all about your          incident with Mr. Stockton.           You tell it, Clara.           Oh, don't be like that, Phil. Please.           Guys... you've obviously been through          something traumatic tonight. Thankfully          it's over and you're both safe and sound.          Maybe you should cut each other a little          bit more of a break.          Phil and Clara look at each other, each letting out air.          Manning's right.           Seriously, Clara. You tell him.           Well, we never a. t_::ally ""met""          Stockton.                                                                                                                 He was in another room on a speakerphone          where these guys who kidnapped us took          us. But he was obviously the one pulling          the strings.           Who is this Stockton guy anyway?            Let me fill you in on all that later.          Now, why would he have wanted to kidnap          you two?           Honestly, you wouldn't believe this, but          it's because we sat down at the wrong          table tonight for dinner.           (looks up, interest          Really? The wrong table?           We pretended to be someone else who          didn't show up for their reservations.          My idea. And it turned out that these          people must have something this Mr.          Stockton wants.            Do you know what?            Photos.          Lieutenant looks up, interested, then writes again.           That's all you know?          Phil and Clara look at each other. Nod.            OK. I'm just confused about one thing.          When you took this other reservation, how          did you know for sure that the real Gales          weren't going to show up late?            Excuse me?                                                                                                               How were you so sure the Gales weren          going to show up if you don't know the          at all?          Clara looks down at the table, furrowing her brow.           Clara?           Sorry. I... I lost my train of thought.           Well, I can pick things up then.          Phil notices Clara giving him a LOOK.           What? Why are you looking at me like          that?           (intensifying the look)          I'm not looking at you like anything.          doesn't pick up on it. Shrugs.            OK, well, I had the same question for her          when we sat down, which she thought was           Rubbing her forehead, Clara KICKS Phil's leg HARD under          the table.           OW! Jesus!          Clara stink-eyes Phil AGAIN, trying to get the message          across.           And there's that look again!           look! No. Looking. At all.          RINGING. Lieutenant Manning reaches into his jacket          pocket and checks the number on the cellphone. He hops          up.           Can you excuse me a moment?                                                                                                                utenant Manning gets up and exits the room. Clara          does to the window in the door and watches him walk down          the hall to his office as he talks on the phone. Phil          puts his leg on the table, pulling up his pant leg to          inspect.           OK, I'm not dense, Clara. That was not          an accident and if those weren't looks-           Phil, we're in trou           What are you talking about?           He's in on this. He's got something to          do with it.           The police guy? Clara, that's tota            never told him about the Gale           What do you mean?           He said, ""How did you know the Gales          weren't coming."" I never told him that          was the name of the reservation we           be I said it to the other           He didn't take the other notes,          Phil. Remember?          s hil as well.           Oh God.           How do we get out of here?           Manning talks in his off ice.                                                                                                                 Uh huh. I know you don't. It will be          contained. Right now.          Hanging up the phone, Manning walks quickly back through          the police station to the interview room. He stops in          the doorway...          .it's EMPTY. Confused, he turns to an OFFICER outside          at the desk.            Where'd they go?           They said you were done with them.          Manning walks quickly back to his office.          Sitting behind his desk, Manning enters a password on his          computer and starts typing out an ALL POINTS BULLETIN.          We are CLOSE UP on the computer screen as the words come              Clara drives as Phil scans the rearview mirror from the          passenger seat.           We can't just go to another police          station, Phil! We don't know how big          this is! It might not just be Manning!           Well then we're screwed! Who do we go          to? The FBI? The CIA?            They're not going to believe us over a          Police Lieutenant!           Shit. This is their car, Phil. We gotta          lose it too.          Searching the street, Clara spots a OPEN PARKING SPACE.          She whips the wheel around, trying to parallel park into          the space.                                                                                                                  You've got it, Clara. Spin it back now!           just let me do it,          She spins too late and too severely, hitting the curb.           Dammit! I hate this!           It's all right. You just should have          spun it when I told you to.          Flustered, she pulls back out and tries again.           rn! Quick!           Would you stop it? You're stressing me          out!          Angry, Clara whips the car back into the spot, NAILING          the car behind them and setting off a loud CAR ALARM WITH            Hearing the alarm, a LARGE MAN rushes out of a restaurant          nearby, looking at them.           Hey! You just hit my          The Large Man stomps toward them.           Run!          Phil and Clara get out of the car and run away on          The Large Man marches over and inspects his bumpe          yells after them.           Assholes!           They catch their breath in the alley.          OK. So we've got no car. They know          where we live. So where can we-           shit.                                                                                                                Clara's eyes go wide as it hits her as well.           Ollie.          Phil takes out his cellphone and quickly dials, listening          as Ruth PICKS UP.           Hello?          Suddenly, GUNSHOTS RING OUT over the phone.           Oh God! Ruth! Is everything OK?           No it's not, Phil!           What's wrong?           Feet up, Ruth eats Fiddle Waddle as she watches an action-          packed CHASE SCENE on TV.            It's CSI night! Call after 11!          Ruth hangs up the phone, shaking her head, and takes          another mouthful of Fiddle Fiddle.           Phil looks at the phone, incredulous.           What's wrong?              What? Just call her again and tell her          what's happened!          Phil dials the number again. Ruth picks up.           Ruth, I need you to listen. We've                                                                                                                  We sure do Phil! We sure do!          Ruth slams the phone down and pulls out the phone cord so          she won't be bothered again.           Clara tries on her phone, then hangs up, frustrated.           Great, Phil. Now she's not picking up at          all!           You think this is my fault, don't you?          T - ft           No. I just don't know why you two can't          get along is all.           You know, your Mom shows me no respect, 0          Clara. And you just pretend like it          isn't happening.           So you think it's j1y fault. Listen,          Phil. Every single other boyfriend I          ever dated got along with her just-           Wait a minute! Holbrooke Peterson!           What?          Clara starts looking through her purse for her phone.           Holbrooke Peterson does something hush          hush with the FBI! I think he even lives          down here.           Holbrooke Peterson? You mean the tongue          guy?           What?                                                                                                                Holbrooke was your prom date who you said          had the really long tongue, right?            Oh yeah.          (catching herself, shrugs           Uh, yeah... something like that...          She finds her phone and dials.           Since when have you been in touch with          Holbrooke Peterson?            We found each other on Facebook®           Facebook? I didn't know you were on          Facebook!           It's a networking thing for work.          Everyone's on Facebook.            0 yeah? Who else are you ""in touch""          h on Facebook?            Hello? Holbrooke? Thank God you're          there. It's Clara Foster...           HOLBROOKE PETERSON, a thoroughbred of a man in his mid-          30's, opens the door to his candlelit apartment with a          smile to find Phil and Clara.           Wow! Clara! You look exactly the same           So do you!          He gives her a big, tight hug, lifting her a little.           You feel exactly the same too.          Phil double-takes. Did he hear him right?                                                                                                                 This is my husband, Phil.           Ah! The man who actually landed Clara.          Holbrooke gives Phil the up and down with a winning smile          and holds out his hand.           Philly Cheese Steak. Nice to meet you.           Um... yeah... I don't go by... it's 1 - usL          Phil. Nice to meet you, too.           Well, c'mon in. If you don't mind, take          off your shoes.           Oh.Sure.           Cutsdown on the cleaning. Which cuts          downon the use of all those chemicals          andplastics, blab blah blah. Reduces my              Carbon footprint.           Oh. The environmental thing.            Yeah, the ""environmental thing,"" Phil.          As they walk into the apartment in their socks, they          notice the whole place is filled with reclaimed and          recycled furniture and LIT WITH CANDLES.           How beautiful. Or, the candles... Did we           Oh, no. I jus-_. --'-D.> myself off the gr          a few weeks ago.           The grid?                                                                                                                 Power grid. I actually have a negative          carbon footprint now. Making up for, you          know, all you ""Phil""-i-stines in the          suburbs.          Holbrooke chuckles. Phil's about to say something when a          look from Clara reminds him to bite his lip. Holbrooke          gestures to some cardboard furniture.           So have a seat.          Holbrooke starts to sit down himself, then makes a show          of taking a LARGE GUN out of his shoulder holster and          putting it on the table.           Whoa. You carry that around at home?           Yeah. I'm supposed to sleep with her          under my pillow.           Wish I didn't have to, but I just see it          as... I carry the weight so citizens like          yourselves don't have to.            It's so funny. I always knew you'd end          up doing something in public service.            I don't know. That's lust how I          Phil looks to Clara - can you get a load of this guy, but          Clara's focused on Holbrooke.           Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is          not a man you want to get on the wrong          side of.           Phil watches as Holbrooke licks the salt allllll the wav          around his Margarita glass with his extra long tongue.          Clara listens intently, eating some jicama slices from a          platter on the table in front of them.           He's like a Nicaraguan turtle - keeps his          head deep in his shell unless he          absolutely has to stick it out. Those          photos must be really important to him.                                                                                                                  More jicama, Clara? And sure no          Margari-La to calm your nerves?           No thanks, I'm          Holbrooke picks up the plate and Margarita glass, then          crosses to his INDOOR COMPOSTER, adding the extra liquid          and scraps.           What does Stockton do?           Officially, he runs a bunch of these          exclusive private clubs downtown where          his high powered friends go to let their          hair down. Has one place called Le          Passage, another called The Rainbow-           e Rainbow! Stockton asked how we          there to set things up!            Interesting. I've had some of my guys          looking into Stockton for years, but          nothing ever sticks to him. He's very          careful - ties up his loose ends and          covers his tracks. But with this... he          might have accidentally left himself          open.           The th need to do now is keep you          two safe. I'm going to call the office,          put you under some protection until we          figure out the best game           Should we be worried about our s           (shakes his head)          Wouldn't be Stockton's pattern to risk          ing this any larger than it is. Where          is he?           I s staying at my m            Aw, how is Ruth? Always thought the          world of her.                                                                                                                 And she of you.          As it comes out of her mouth, Clara realizes and guiltily          looks over at Phil BRISTLING. Holbrooke goes to a pile          of already used sheets of paper and picks one up along          with a pen.           I'll just need your full names and your          socials so I can get the paperwork          started at the bureau. Not yours, Clara.          Know that by heart.          Both Phil and Clara are taken aback.            Just kidding. But I'm sure Phil-a-buster          knows 'em both, right?          Phil looks on both sides of the paper Holbrooke hands          him.           Uh... there's already writing all over          this.             Does another tree really need to die for          me to get your socials, Phil?          Phil bites his tongue yet again, squeezing the writing          into a side of the paper.           So just one kid, guys? What's keeping          you? Clocks ticking Clara - tickety tock          tuck.            Yeah, well, that's a topic for another-           It's just that by now, you and I woulda          had a whole brood.           (under his breath)          That's... charming.          Phil scoots the paper back to Holbrooke, who squints and          dramatically turns it sideways.                                                                                                                w! Paging Dr. Illegible,           egible to Emergency!           Holbrooke and Clara burst into laughter. Phil            L.O.L,, right?          (thinking he doesn't           It's because you're writing's hard to          read, Phil, and everyone knows how when          doctors write things down-           No. Yeah. I get it.          Holbrook. makes a big show of putting his gun back          holster as he gets up.           We'll have you stay at the bureau for the          night. Safer for you.           Thank you so much, Holbrooke.          (sighs, relieved)          I feel like we're in good hands for the E          first time tonight.          As Holbrooke goes into the other room to call, Clara lets          out a sigh of relief then notices Phil's mood.           What's wrong?           I don't know. Maybe I should have had          one of Holbrooke's eeegerag warn          raaaarrrrghereeeeetas.            Clam::- olbrooke in the front seat and Phil          crt-- - in t=-� back, they pull up and park at the FBI          bui Aing m           smells like french fries back here,           Car runs on cooking oil. I just go          around to restaurants and recycle their          old fry oil.                                                                                                                 Phil's really had enough with this guy.          Your goodness... where does it end?          Clara shoots Phil a look he back, but Holbrooke          doesn't get his sarcasm.            How I roll. Now for some reason they          wanted us to come in the back entrance.          He makes a big show of putting his gun back in his          shoulder strap before getting out of the car.           Through the window, we see Holbrooke, Phil, and Clara          walking toward the back of the building.          In the foreground, A SHADOWY GUY watches them, then          whispers into his walkie.           Positions.           Holbrooke uses a KEYCARD on his keychain with a flourish          to enter the rear of the building, then leads Phil and          Clara through the doors. Suddenly he stops and Phil and          Clara FREEZE behind them.          At the other end of the hallway, an FBI UNIT in          bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of          them. AGENT #1 in the center, obviously the agent in          charge, yells to them.           Continue slowly down the hallway.          sudden movements. Are they armed,          Peterson?           Uh,           What the hell's going o           I don't know.                                                                                                                 Well, tell them to stand down.           Uh.. .           Tell your men to stand down, Holbrooke.           His men?          The Agents look at each other and chuckle.           What do you want us to do, Holbrooke?          Reformat our hard drives?           Our badass I.T. guy!          The laughter builds.           I. I. guy?           OK... I'm not the ""I.T. guy."" I help out           with computer questions out of kindness!          But see if that happens anymore, Harold!           Alright, enough. Point is, Agent          Peterson scored tonight. When I typed in          those socials, an APB shot up with a          whole laundry list on these guys.           What?           crooked cop did it! It's a lie!           It's your booking, Peterson. We're Just          here to back you up.          Holbrooke...          Holbrooke looks nervously between the Agents and Phil and          Clara. He turns to them, taking Clara's arm.           Listen guys. I'll just book you and then          tomorrow we can straighten the whole-                                                                                                                 (pulling arm away)          What? Oh no you're not!          Oooohs from the Agents.           You just gonna take that, Peterson?            All right. Didn't want to have to-          Holbrooke reaches into his holster to whip out his gun...          .but BOBBLES it and it falls to the ground, right at          Phil's feet. Looking down, Phil instinctively GRABS IT,          holding the gun to Holbrooke's head.           All right! Nobody move or he gets it!          Clara's STUNNED. The Agents look at each other, but          don't seem overly concerned.           Holbrooke has a gun? Why does he even          • have a gun?            Listen, man. I'm not that important.          I'm really not. I'm not the IT guy but          I'm just one step above him! No reason          to do something rash, all right?           You think it's even loaded?           I don't.            loaded, guys! It's loaded!           I'm not screwing around!           He's not screwing around! He's not          screwing around!          Pulling a terrified Holbrooke, Phil and Clara back toward          the rear exit of the building. They try the door, but          it's locked.                                                                                                                 Keycard.           What?           He wants your keycard.           Thanks. He and I, the communication          isn't great...          Getting the keychain from Holbrooke, Phil uses the          keycard then lets it fall to the floor as the door          unlocks and they back outside.           Phil and Clara back away, keeping Holbrooke between th          and the agents. Through the door, Agents slowly creep          down the hallway after them, guns trained.           Seriously, Phil. I'm a bad shield. I          promise.           Wow, Phil!          Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise.           Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke.          When we're about to drive off we'll let          you go.           Uh, they were on the keychain.           What?          HOLB'?n`_          The key chain you dre-,~_d with the keycard          inside. The keys were on that.          And so the hero falls...           Shit.           we'll never outrun them.                                                                                                               Searching around, Phil eyes the KEYCARD PANEL outside the          entrance. He aims the gun and FIRES, MISSING BADLY.          Both he and Holbrooke cover their ears.             YOW! Man is that loud!          As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs          the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock.           (stunned, looks at her)          How are you so good at that?          The Agents try the door, but are LOCKED IN. Agent #1          tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass,          but it's BULLETPROOF. He gestures and all the Agents          rush around to the front.           gotta get going! Quick!           Where?          They both look around, unsure.           Across the bridge a few blocks down that          street there's an entrance to the Green          Line subway. Get on it and you can get          anywhere in this city.          Phil and Clara look at him, confused.           Aren't you supposed to be our hostage?            Whatever. I don't know. Sure. What's          the difference? I'm never gonna get          behind that desk now anyway.          my gun! I dropped it in front of          everybody!           It wasn't so much of a drop. it was more          of a... bobble.           Yeah, a bobble's bad...                                                                                                                Listen, if you just leave me here I can          tell them you ran the other way. It'll          buy you time to get there. And maybe I          can work on clearing all this up for you.          Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run          away. Suddenly Phil stops, thinking.           What?           Let me have the gun.          As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and          hands it to Holbrooke           Here. Tell them you got it back from us.          Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful.           Thanks, Phil.          As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of          husband.           A lit up raucous PARTY BOAT in a canal starts to pass          under a roadway bridge up ahead as Phil and Clara, trying          to stay in the shadows, walk quickly toward it. Phil          glances back over their shoulders - the road is DESERTED.           it's just on the other side of that          bridge. I think we're going to make it.          He notices Clara looking at him.           What?           Nothing. That was just nice of you, back          there.           This is crazy, but you know what I'm,          reminded of right now?           Bourne identity?                                                                                                                I'm talking about right now. When we          used to walk home late at night after          going downtown to the clubs. We couldn't          ever find a cab, remember? We'd grab          those ""healthy"" dogs and cheese fries at          the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler          Planetarium to watch the sunrise.           Where I held your hand for the first          time.           I can't believe we used to stay up all          night like that.           It's because we could sleep 'til noon.            If I remember correctly, we weren't          always ""sleeping.""          Beat as they share the moment together, walking.           I just don't understand when we got so...          I don't know...           Old.           No, I was thinking numb. When did we          become one of those couples that we used          to look at in restaurants back then and          think were so sad?           We're not that bad, Phil. I just think we          haven't been that honest with each other          recently.          Phil doesn't understa           Not big things. Just little things          keep adding up and putting this thing          between us.           Like the fact I know you never want to          talk about us having this other baby.                                                                                                                It's not that I don't want another kid,          Clara. It's just... I used to be the          whole pie with you. And now with Ollie          and your work, I'm barely even a piece of          the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a          pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of          me's not jumping at the chance of having          the little pecan I have left of your          attention going into some new baby's          mouth!           But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home          you're the one who seems like your hardly          even there! It's all about your work.          Believe me, if you-          Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive          past them over the bridge.           Shit!           I think we're OK. Just play cool and          keep walking.          The patrol car continues across and down the street. 1�1          Phil and Clara breathe a sigh of relief.          Then suddenly, a few blocks down, BRAKE LIGHTS. The          patrol car turns around and TURNS ON ITS LIGHTS, zooming          back toward them.           Now you can say shit.          Phil looks around - they're in the middle of the bridge          with no place to run. Then he notices the lit up PARTY          BOAT coming out the other side of the bridge beneath          them.           e 's only a few feet.           What u high? No way.          But looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them,          Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the side of the bridge.                                                                                                                  As she's YANKED OVER THE SIDE, Clara CLUTCHES onto the          railing. With Phil hanging onto her other arm, they          DANGLE above the water and the boat.           Ahhh! Are you CRAZY!?!           Let go, Clara!           A GROUP of DRUNKEN PARTIERS on the boat, spotting them,          cheer below. Some even take FLASH PICTURES. Phil looks          down - if they don't let go soon they're literally going          to miss the boat.           go or I'm going to tickle you!            No you're not, Phil. We have a rule!          tickling. I'm not-          He reaches up and TICKLES Clara under her arm. She          giggles.             Ah! Stop it, Phil! Ah! It's not funny!          I mean- Stop it! Ah!          Clara can't hold on any longer...           They land - THUMP! - onto the top deck of the boat, both          groaning as they roll back and forth while the Drunken          Partiers CHEER and FLASH PHOTOS.           Ow! I think I broke my butt.           OW! OW! Dammit, Phil! What's our rule          about tickling?           I'm sorry! I didn't do it for pleasure!          What is our rule?                                                                                                                  ""It's only funny if it's funny for the          both of us.""           Right! And guess what? It wasn't funny          for me, Phil!          Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm. Walking          down the side of the boat, she passes a MAN down on one          knee in front of an EXCITED WOMAN, who nods, accepting          his proposal.            B i g mistake!          They look at her, stunned.           Phil limps along, finally finding Clara alone and calmed          down, looking out over the rear of the boat. He comes          next to her. Beat.           T ' s your elbow?            's OK, How`s your butt?           Well, for jumping off a bridge onto a          moving boat, not so bad.           I can't even fucking believe this is          happening to us.           You know, we're kind of running ou          ons.           Maybe we could just hide or something          until this all blows over.           What makes you think it ever wil           iaybe we should just turn ourselves                                                                                                                  Imagine what it's going to be like for          Ollie when everyone hears about this          tomorrow. I bet our pictures are going          to be all over the papers.          Phil nods, gazing out. Then suddenly an idea comes to          him.           Wait. What if we found the pictures?           What do you mean?           These pictures that everyone's after.          we could get them we'd have some kind o          bargaining chip to get out of this.           But then we'd have to find the Gales.          don't know anything about them.            Except... the Rainbow.            The pictures have something to do with          that place!           Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these          clubs are so secret you have to know          where they are and how to get in-          Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone,          dialing, then notices Phil looking out, shaking his head.           What?           You're not listening to me again!           ""You have to know where they are and h          to get in-""           That's great. Clara wanna cracker?                                                                                                                I'm calling because of what you said,          Phil. I know who can help us.          Clara dials the number.           Hey Jane, it's Clara.           Where am I?          (beat, looks around)          I'm... I'm on a party cruise around          Chicago. Oh yeah. It is turning into          quite a night. Listen, we need to go to          this club called the Rainbow later. Do          you know how we can get in?          Clara looks at Phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her          ear and listens. Phil watches her until he notices the          boat IS TURNING. He looks around the side.          A slew of POLICE CARS on the shore. He taps Clara.           ara...          Clara turns and looks.           Oh shoot. You know what Jane? I've          actually gotta jump off right now.           POLICE swarm all over the tour boat, checking every          compartment. A DRUNKEN PARTIER shows Lieutenant Manning          SNAPSHOTS of Phil and Clara landing, groaning, and          arguing on the back of his digital camera. A POLICEMAN          comes up to Manning and shakes his head.           Check again.          Manning pockets the camera and starts to walk away.           Hey! That's mine, man!           Evidence.          The Partier mumbles ""Asshole"" as he stumbles          Manning si i.s and looks out over the wa                                                                                                                 It's WINDY and COLD as Phil and Clara, soaked, squeak and          slosh down the street. Clara, missing one heel, dumps          water out of her purse as she checks her cellphone.           Mine's totally shot too.           You got the info from her though, right?           Yeah, but we can't get in looking like          this, Phil.           I don't think we have a choice. Not a          big shopping hour.          They walk past the 24 CHICAGO FITNESS CENTER, lights          blazing. Windows show machines filled with young          HARDBODIES working out.           Now if we wanted to do a little cardio,          on the other hand. Who knew that many          people worked out at 1 in the morning?          Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks          back up at the building.           You wanna do a little cardio?          Clara smirks at him, then Phil, thinking, gets it. He          shakes his head.           OK, now that's scary. You know you're          starting to think like a real criminal?          You know that, don't you?          Clara waggles her eyebrows. We hear Devo's ""Secret Agent          Man"" over a TrC _ GE .           - Phil and Clara walk up to the front counter, where the          GYM GREETER boredly watches TV. They say something and          the Greeter waves them through without looking up. As          they hurry on, the Greeter's TV goes to a PROMO TEASER          for the local late night news: a SNAPSHOT of Phil and          Clara from the boat with a caption that reads: BONNIE AND                                                                                                                 - In the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil pulls at the COMBINATION          LOCKS, searching for an open locker. Unable to find one,          he picks up a bench to throw it at them when TWO JOCKS in          workout clothes walk in and look at him strangely as he          holds the bench. Phil moves the bench back and forth,          pretending it's part of his EXERCISE ROUTINE.          - In the WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Clara, wrapped in a towel,          blows out her hair at the mirror. An ATTRACTIVE THIN          WOMAN walks behind her toward the showers and they smile          at each other in the mirror. As the THIN WOMAN          disappears behind the shower glass, Clara makes a MAD          DASH for the lockers.          - Back in the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil lingers as a MAN IN          A DARK SUIT undresses, getting ready to work out. As the          man is about to lock his locker, Phil rushes up to him,          excitedly telling him something and pointing outside.          The man, confused, exits, and Phil MOVES IN, quickly          undressing.          - The Attractive Thin Woman comes back to her locker and          opens it. Her face drops. Inside hang CL A""S DRIPPING           - OUTSIDE THE GYM, Phil, looking slick in a colored shirt          and black suit, walks quickly around the corner, then          stops, stunned. Clara, waiting for him with her hair          blown out and in a tight fitting RED FLAPPER DRESS with •          RED HEELS, looks AMAZING. From her expression, she feels          the same about Phil.           Looking both ways, Phil and Clara walk nervously down a          dark, derelict alley.           Down here?           It's what she said.           And if you die, does Jane get your          commissic-l on the open house?          Up ahead, a TWO S:_=:Y LOOKING CHARACTERS huddle near a          bunch of GARBAGE CANS watching them, a SMALL FIRE nearby.          Nervously, Clara approaches.           Excuse me?          Men shoot her a fierce look.                                                                                                                 Um... do you know which is the way back          to Kansas?          They eye her, then inspect Phil up and down. One of them          LUNGES, and Phil jumps back...          but he's moving aside some trash cans, revealing a          RAINBOW COLORED STAIRWAY going down.           Welcome to the Rainbow.           Reaching the bottom of the stairway, Phil and Clara,          amazed, take in THE RAINBOW.          It's a CAVERNOUS ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION that's been          converted into a GLAMOROUS CLUB. The place is PACKED          with an elite looking CROWD. Everything in the room -          the carpet, the tapestries, the clothes of the waitstaff -          is EMERALD GREEN.          Phil and Clara nod at each other then separate,          disappearing into the mix.           Phil looks around, amazed as he wanders between BLACKJACK          and BACCARAT tables, where well-to-do OLDER guests gamble          large sums of money, fast looking WOMEN cheering them on.           If you wanner be pissed at anyone about          it, be pissed at Stockton...          Hearing the name, Phil spots a BALDING MAN talking to 2          other MEN at one of the tables. He lingers closer.           You know, rumor is he's behind the whole          mess. Raking it in on both ends.          What do you mean?           Hush hush shell companies he owns. One          of them hires all the construction          inspectors. Another he's got rents all          the construction equipment. The more one          slows things down with violations,          more the other takes to the bank.                                                                                                               The Balding Man leans in and speaks more quietly, causing          Phil to lean in even more.           My guess is he's trying to screw up Mayor          Diggs' reelection. Imagine what someone          like him could do if he got someone less          ""squeaky clean"" in the Mansion.          The Balding Man suddenly notices Phil listening. Phil          pastes on an excited face.           you! Gale, right?           What?           Sorry. From the side... confused you          with somebody else.          Phil quickly moves on.           Clara talks to a BUSY BARTENDER at the bar as he          scrambles to fill drink orders.           really get s,-.y names.           Thanks any-way.          With a sigh, Clara starts away from the bar, when she           ough the crowd, FRANK and HARRY walk right toward her -          but they haven't seen her yet. Clara spots the KITCHEN          DOORS nearby and rushes through.          INT. KITCHEN - C vUOUS          Clara peeks out through the double door windows. Frank          and Harry continue through the crowd, unaware.           Watch it!          Clara quickly hugs a large bulletin board covered with          pictures and time schedules as a WAITER carries a large          tray of food past her.                                                                                                               As she moves off the wall, some papers drop. Clara pins          them back on, when something else on the bulletin board          catches her eye...          .Among all the snapshots of staff scattered on the          bulletin board is a picture of a backyard party with a          whole group of laughing young people, and the middle of          the picture, smiling at the camera...          . is THE NERVOUS WOMAN FROM THE SIGNATURE ROOM           Clara pulls the picture off the wall. She catches a          WAITRESS coming back through the double doors.           Excuse me. Does she work here?           Dora? I guess she still does. Hasn't          been showing up lately, though.           Do you know where I can find her?           You could try back tomorrow, see if she-           I need to find her tonight.           Did you try Ray's place?           Ray?           That sleazebag boyfriend of hers. He's          got that place a few blocks from here          where he used to throw those after work          parties.           Do you remember where it is?           Phil scans the crowds, back and forth.           Phil!          Hearing his name, Phil nervously turns. MR. RIVERS and          GEORGE stand together in a corner.                                                                                                                  hit.           This is a surprise! What are you doing          down here?           Uh... well, same thing as you guys, I          would guess. Working those ""extra          hours,"" right?           Phil!          Clara, looking amazing in her red flapper dress, weeds          through the crowd. Mr. Rivers and George take her in,          obviously impressed.           Phil, we gotta go. I found out where-            Clara, you remember Mr. Rivers?          Clara suddenly notices Phil's boss.          Oh. Oh. Yeah.           And I'm George.           Sorry, but I've got to steal him. We've          gotta be somewhere else right now.           At 2 in the morning? Where are you guys          headed?            I'm sorry, Mr. Rivers. We really can          talk about it.          Phil and Clara move off quickly through the crowd as Mr.          Rivers watches the hand_�__e, dressed up couple,          intrigued.           Phil Foster with places to go he can          talk about at 2 in the morning.                                                                                                                  You know what makes kangaroos so damn          dangerous, George? They look so sweet          and tame, so you forget they're wild          animals. Lethal when they want to be.          George, not fully understanding, chuckles and holds out          his hand for another handshake, but Mr. Rivers, still          watching Phil, LEAVES HIM HANGING.           A TV MONITOR IMAGE of Phil and Clara making their way          through the crowd to the exit.          In the dark room, Frank and Harry look expectantly to the          well dressed man in a dark suit, who absently twirls with          two metal balls in his hand.           See where they take you.           Phil and Clara knock on the door of a the deserted          looking row house. No answer. Clara tries the door...           That never really-          OPENS. She shoots Phil a look.           OK. Never mind.          Phil and Clara inch insi           As they start down the dark hallway to the living room,          Phil hunches over, hugging the wall.           are you bent over like that?           sneaking.           Rut why don't you just walk normally and          quietly?           This is the wav I sneak. You sneak in          your way and I'll sneak in mine, OK?                                                                                                                 OK. Fine. I was just asking.          Clara walks quietly behind crouching Phil. Reaching the          living room, they spot TWO PACKED SUITCASES on the couch.          Suddenly, the DOOR SLAMS behind them and RAY holds a gun          to Phil's head, DORA nervously next to him.           Talk! Who are you?           You know, that's like the 5th gun I've          had to my head tonight! Just lower that          thing and cool it, OK?          Off guard from Phil's reaction, Ray, confused, does.           She was in the bathroom at the          restaurant!           Who are you?           Who are we? Good question! Well,          everybody thinks we're ""the Gales""          because we were lucky enough to take your          reservation tonight!            What? Why would you take our          reservation?          Phil shoots Clara a look.           Don't.           Both of you. Stand ov there in the          corner. Dammit Dora, ere's your          goddamn brother? He was E,.--,-Dc.-zed to b          here an hour ago!          I don't know, Ra_, He's not answering          his phone.           Yeah, well, if these guys found u          long do you think it's gonna take          other guys? We're dead! DEAD!                                                                                                                 Excuse me.          In the corner, Clara raises her hand. Ray eyes her          strangely.           Sorry. I have to pee.            You have to nee?          Clara nods. Phil shrugs.           That's my wife.          Flustered, Ray waves Dora to take Clara.           Dora talks to Clara as she washes her face in the sink.           You must just think I'm awful.           I don't think anything about you. I just          want this to be over.           Ray saw Mr. Stockton making all this          money blackmailing people at the club.          When he found out who was interested in          me... he said it would be so easy. We'd          never have to work again.             We're coming!           Ray peeks nervously out of the window, searching the          street.           Listen, it looks like things didn't turn          out the way you planned, but I think all          Stockton wants is his pictures back. As          soon as he gets them I bet-                                                                                                                Stockton's pictures? You.think they're          Stockton's pictures?           You really have no idea what you've          gotten into, do you?          BOOM! The window SHATTERS and Ray and Phil hit the deck.          As Ray starts blindly firing back, Phil crawls on his          knees and elbows across the floor toward the bathroom.             I'm OK! I'm OK!          Ray spots Phil crawling away and gets up, turning to him.           Hey! Get-          Suddenly, Ray is SHOT IN THE ARM through the window. He          drops to the ground in pain, yelling and clutching his          arm.           Ahh!           Phil crabs along even faster.           Clara rushes to the bathroom door, pulling Phil inside          and locking it.          As Clara focuses on Phil, Dora thinks fast, taking an          ELOPE out of her purse and putting it into Clara's          bout them seeing.           Oh God! Are you hit?           No... just... a little ... winded...          that... crawling's... tough... on the          core...           As Harry kicks the gun away from Ray, moaning on the          floor, Frank comes to the bathroom door. He lightly raps          on it, then speaks softly.                                                                                                                 How about you guys let me in before          someone gets really hurt?           Dora quickly opens the window and gestures for Phil and          Clara to climb through. Just as they squeeze outside...          BAM! The door handle's BLOWN OFF and Frank kicks the          door in. He grabs Dora, rushing toward the window, but          Phil and Clara are GONE.           Dammit!          Frank eyes Dora, then SHOOTS HER IN THE FOOT, sending          screaming to the ground in pain.           You stay put.          He hurries back through the house.           Phil and Clara sprint to the street as a BUICK pulls up          in front and a confused looking CHUBBY GUY steps           Hey? Which is 357 Maple Street?           You're Dora's brother?           Who are you?           You're late!           OK sorry! The roads are all screwed          with all this construction-          BOOM! They wince as a SHOT hits the rearview mirror of          the car. All three spin to see Frank aiming his gun and          marching toward them, Harry right behind him.           Hey!          Phil quickly pushes Dora's brother aside as he and Clara          hop into the Buick and PEEL OUT.                                                                                                               Frank and Harry SPRINT for their Towncar down the block.           Phil screeches the car around the corner.           Phil! Careful!          Phil WHIPS the car around another bend.           Please, Phil! It's not going to do any          good if you-           (taking another sharp turn)          Clara! Please! Just leave the driving          to me, OK?!? I know what I'm-          SMASH! - they HIT something head-on, SHATTERING the          windshield.           Shaking glass off himself, Phil peers forward. They're          face to face - nose to nose - with another broken          windshield. In the driver's seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA          h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG BLACK DUDE •          stares at them in shock.           No no no. Tell me you did not just do          that.           Shit!          The Black Dude gets out of his car to inspect, head in          hands.           Oh, man! You did not just do that!          Whew, you gonna be payin' for this!           owe you one.          Phil throws the car into reverse, but his tires just          screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place.          Looking out his window toward the front, Phil sees that            The Black Dude comes toward him.                                                                                                                Oh no no no. You're gonna get outta this          car and hand me over a license and some          insurance. We gonna do this right. Man,          I think I got whiplash and shit.          A SCREECH. Phil looks back to see FRANK AND HARRY'S          TOTnNCAR coming around the corner.           Shit.          Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car and hops into          the Black Dude's souped up Honda.           Hey! HEY! What do you think you're          doing?          The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver's          door, but Phil's LOCKED it. Phil yells to Clara.             What? That's insane!           Frank and Harry's car SPEEDS TOWARDS THEM. It will smash          into them in seconds...            Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to          reverse, and guns it. At the same moment, Phil steps on          the gas.          The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS          as he's THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY          SHAMMY BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The          Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield          into the passenger's seat next to Phil.                Huh?                                                                                                                    Phil, this is-              (to Black Dude)           Mumbling angrily, Clara puts her car in drive and steps          on it. Their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels          smoke and speed up in the OTHER DIRECTION. They race          past Frank again, who angrily whips the Towncar around in          pursuit.          Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their          conjoined cars down the middle of the street, but he and          Clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer :ildly          back and forth. They hit the curb at an angle and -JcK          DOWN a whole row of mail boxes until Phil spins h--'-s v;:-reel,          getting them back into the street.           Just let me out, OK? You can have it! 1�1          You can have it!                I'm not yelling! I'm just talking in an          very animated voice!          Looking back over his shoulder again, Phil sees they're          approaching the lar          ge intersection with Michigan Avenue.           OK, now when I say so, spin your wheel!            On his command, Clara spins her wheel sharply to t1-          right., but it's the wrong way and their cars JACK          across the road. An ONCOMING SUV honks desperately.           Ahhhh! Other way! Other way!                                                                                                               Flustered, Clara WHIPS her wheel in the other direction,          and their two cars tilt up on four wheels (out of eight),          barely screeching past.          Landing again and taking in a deep breath, Phil shoots          her a pissed off look.           What? You just said spin the wheel,          Phil! You didn't say which way.           Yes I did!           No you didn't!           She's right! You di            God! Thank you! Can we take him home?          I need him!          Both Phil and the Black Dude sees that the Towncar's          turned onto Michigan Avenue and is still right behind          E them.            Aw man!            I say our best chance is to reverse          again, then use both engines to floor          as fast as we can all the way down          Michigan.           Why stay on Michigan?           Why stay on Michigan? Because it's a          wider street.           It's also a busier street! I think it          would be better to try to branch off.            Why do you have a problem with every          route I take?          Flustered, Phil turns to the Black Dude next to him to          commiserate, unaware that his STEERING WHEEL DRIFTS.                                                                                                                 She does this wherever we go! Every          time!          Phil doesn't notice the LIGHTS GROWING BRIGHTER behind          him..            LOUD HONNNNNNNKKKKKK. Phil and the Black Dude look over          their shoulders to see they're heading straight for a             Phil SPINS the wheel sharply and they go SIDEWAYS,          jumping the curb and soaring into MILLENNIUM PARK.          In their car following them, Frank and Harry's -mouths          drop.           The conjoined cars sail across the          grass and SMASH          THROUGH a barrier, landing on the MCCORMICK ICE RINK.          Their cars PINWHEEL OUT OF CONTROL across the ice. Phil,          Clara, and the Black Dude are all WIDE EYED as the world          is a SPINNING BLUR around them.          Finally, they hit the other side. Getting his bearings,          Phil sees the Towncar has entered the park after them.          He searches where to go next, then spots something.           Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight          put your foot to the floor. Give it          everything!          Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors          it. The car goes faster... faster...           Oooh. I really woulc_n.'t be doing that.           Doing what? What are you doing?!?          Clara glances over her shoulder. Their heading strai          toward a CONCRETE STAIRWAY.           Oh God.                                                                                                                  Just trust me!          The conjoined cars HIT the steps and their wheels SMOKE          as the TWO ENGINES POWER TOGETHER ALL THE WAY UP THE           The Towncar tries the follow them, but its single engine          doesn't have enough power. Swearing under his breath,          Frank reverses back down the steps.           Phil and the Black Guy both look back over their          shoulders as they speed by Anish Kapoor's large metallic          CLOUD GATE. No sign of the Towncar. The Black Guy holds          up his hand for Phil.           Ha HA! That last move was wicked, man.          Wicked.          They try to give each other a fancy handshake, but Phil,          the WHITEST MAN EVER, muddles it up.           • Sorry.           s cool.            They're back.          They peek again over their shoulders. The Towncar's          driven around and is now BACK ON THEIR TAILS.           Jesus! What the hell are you guys in          trouble for?            f i ght... you name it.           Phil and Clara's conjoined cars barrel across the gr ss          of the Great Lawn in Millennium park, then SPIN onto          Columbus Drive, the Towncar giving chase.                                                                                                                Phil peeks back over his shoulder then sighs, looking at          Clara.           Can we just try to work together at this?             I'm not blaming you. Please?          Clara nods.           Now whatever direction I give you, take          your normal version of it and tone it          down like 85 percent, OK?           35 percent. Fine.           OK. Small left. Now!           Clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel slightly lefts          They ZOOM around the corner.            Yes! That was awesome! Perfect, Clara!          Now give me a medium right. Do it!          She does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another          street.           Yes!           Now we're cooking with fire!          Now tiny le            You act it!          They make the slightest turn.                                                                                                                  Yes!          (spotting something ahead)          No.           Oh no.           What?          Clara turns around to look. LIGHTS FLASH as a BARRIER          comes down across the road - A DRAWBRIDGE ahead is slowly          rising.          Phil looks behind - the Towncar's got them closed in.          The Black Dude peeks back as well, then turns to Phil.           say we can pop you guys up and over.             Excuse me? What are you talking about,          ""pop you guys up and over?""            You climb over, then we both reverse it          and leadfoot the motherfuckers. Send you          flying over the top.           What?          Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control of the car back          to the Black Dude. As the conjoined cars zoom toward the          drawbridge, Phil CRAWLS ON THE ATTACHED HOODS FROM ONE          WINDSHIELD TO THE OTHER, sitting next to Clara.           Phil, don't even think of it.           can do it. Clara.           No, Phil. We can't! It's suicide!           Here we go now... One... two... THREE!                                                                                                                 But Phil reaches over and switches the gear to reverse,          stepping on Clara's foot to GUN IT.            The two cars SMOKE as their wheels spin in opposite          directions, then DISLODGE. Phil and Clara's car flies          reverse UP ONE SIDE OF THE DIAGONAL DRAWBRIDGE...          .and LANDS SPINNING IN A FLURRY OF SPARKS OVER ON THE          OTHER SIDE, causing AIR BAGS to deploy all around Phil          and Clara.          The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing his          Honda across the road, and PUTS ON HIS SEAT BELT. Frank          and Harry's eyes go wide as Frank jams on his brakes, but          the Towncar CRASHES right into the Honda.          ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank          and Harry.           Hope you all got insurance.          Hitting a button, he starts a FIBER-OPTIC LIGHT SHOW on          his Honda.            As their car comes to a SMOKING, SPINNING STOP in the          middle of the deserted road, Phil sandwiched in air bags,          catches his breath.            We did it! We did it!          A DOOR SLAM. Phil moves an air bag aside to see Clara          MARCHING AWAY down the street.           Phil rushes after Clara, trying to catch up.          Where are you going?           I want to make sure that at least one          our son's parents survives tonight!           What?                                                                                                                 You almost just got us killed!           I see. I almost got us killed. Forget          about the people chasing and shooting at          us all night long because of the          reservation you stole.           There's a difference between fleeing from          people shooting at you and knowingly          driving a car in reverse over an open          drawbridge!           Unbelievable! You know, all you complain          about is that I don't take risks anymore.          Then the second I do, you get mad at me          for doing it! I can't win with you!           Poor Phil! You have i so bad, don't          you!           Oh, you have no idea! Every single day          from the moment we wake up you're bossy,          • disapproving, inconsiderate-           I'm inconsiderate? I'M INCONSIDERATE?!?          Have you ever seen our bathroom in the          morning after Tsunami Phil's blown          through? The floor! The sink! You use          my toothbrush.           What's the difference? Afraid you're          gonna get my cooties?           I want my own toothbrush, Phil! Sue me!          And how many years have I asked you to do          a simple thing like put the toilet paper          in right?           Listen to yourself! You have problems          with how I pqt in the toilet paper!           Because under makes no sense, Phil!          Under makes no sense! When it's under it          doesn't pull off right! It just keeps          spinning and spinning and doesn't cascade          properly!                                                                                                                 After ten years of asking you to have          roll the right way, you still can't do          it!           Yeah, how about the fact that I have not          woken up with our comforter over me once          in those 10 nears! You steal the whole          thing away from me every night and          mummify yourself.           What? Phil, I do not ""steal"" the          comforter. It just happens when we're-           (points at her)          Bulls Bull-shit.           Don't you point that at me!           I see your hock leg lock maneuver. Don't          think I don't!           You wrap that leg around and lock the          comforter down then reeeeel it in so I          can't pull it at all.            I do not leg lock the comforter!           Oh yes you do!           u think I don't know your little          icks? Where you leave like half a          thimble of milk in the carton and put it          back in the fridge so you don't have to          be the one to ""finish"" it and replace it?           You're right. I do that. You know why          do that, Clara?           Because you don't want to haul your          ass to the market to buy it yourself!           Because I'm afraid to! God forbid I          the wrong kind of grass-fed bio          homogenized whatever and meet your wrath!          You're like the Nutrition Nazi.                                                                                                                  And I've got to be your little Nutrition          Nazi Goebbels because we have to be this          ""united front"" with Ollie! What's wrong          if he eats two bowls of Captain Sugar          instead of one? Or if his handwriting          isn't perfect? Or if he goes to school          for one day not dressed like Finneas J.          Nerdo!           Poor Phil. I feel so sorry for you. I          must be hard having to be the cool fun          parent while I get to be the one who          makes sure our child's fed, clothed and            How would you even know? You don't give          me or anyone else a chance! You're so          goddamn controlling! You've got to be          Wonder Woman, keeping everyone in line,          looking down on them from her fancy          Wonder Woman plane and controlling          everything with all her wonder          superpowers! You paint yourself as this          victim but you get off on being the          superlady!           Urgh! You know w sometimes I don't pay          attention to you, Phil? Because you give          me a headache!          Clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a          frustrated sigh.           What? No aspirin in the wonderpurse?          How could it be?          Clara, furious, HURLS her purse at Phil's head. He ducks          and the contents spill all over the road.           Screw you, Phil!           Yeah, fine! Sure! Screw me ! Even if I          survive tonight I'm screwed all around          anyway! Screwed with you! Screwed with          my job!           What are you talking about, screwed with          your job?                                                                                                                 was supposed to spend all tonight          guring out a new brilliant plan for the          fund so George wouldn't take it over          tomorrow. Doesn't look like that's gonna          happen!           Why didn't you tell me?           I don't know, Clara. Maybe because I          didn't want you chiming in on how Mr.          Rivers was right. He wants the new guy          for all the reasons you complain about          me! Someone who doesn't ""play it safe.""          Someone who'll ""take a risk.""           I can't believe that's what you think          do.           Yeah, well...           You know, when you set up this whole          ""magical"" night, in that dress... I got          this glimmer that it was going to be like          it used to be with us. But... I don't          know. I guess we're just not those          people anymore.            I guess we're not.          Shaking his head, Phil turns and walks away do-- the          street. Clara, trying to hold it together, h          and starts to gather the items from her purse          something catches his eye. She picks up the          ENVELOPE that Dora put in her bag.           As Phil walks along, Clara comes running up behind him.          Phil! Phil!          She steps in front of him, trying to catch her breath.           I think we said all needs to be said          right now, Clara.          Panting, Clara holds out the manila envelope.                                                                                                                 This... this... this...           What?            Side cramp... Wow.          She hands Phil the manila envelope and bends down, trying          to stop her cramp. Confused, Phil opens it and looks at          the pictures inside. His brow furrows.           What is it?          Clara looks over his shoulder, shakes her head and TURNS          THE PICTURE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Phil's eyes go wide.           Oh jeez. It's... it's...           It's the Mayor.          Phil looks at Clara, taking it all in.           I bet this didn't have anything to do          with Stockton at first.           Phil and Clara walk quickly down the street as they piece          things together.           The Mayor must have gone to Stockton's          club one night. He saw Dora working          there and obviously gave some sign that          he was interested.           So much for ""Mr. Squeaky Clea           Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and          convinces her to take him up on it so          they could photograph it and blackmail          him.           They knew it was an election year and he          would have to pay them whatever they          asked.                                                                                                                But somehow Stockton found out about the          photos too and wanted that power over the          mayor himself.           So he sent his guys to the restaurant to          intercept the Gales and get the photos.           But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed          before the Mayor even had a chance to          show up.          Phil thinks. He snaps his fingers.           What?           If we could find some way to get in touch          with the mayor directly, without anyone          else knowing, there actually might be a          way out of this for us.          Clara thinks for a moment. A light comes to her eyes.           can.           Phil and Clara walk into the lobby of the doorman          building and start toward the elevator, straight past the            Whoa whoa whoa. Where do you          you're going?           Oh, we're guests of Apartment 605          The Doorman picks up the phone to call the apartmen           And you are?          looks at him in shock.           Are you crazy? It's 4 in the morning!           We were lust out for dinner. Trust me                                                                                                                 I'm not really allowed to just let you up          there.           Please. Just look at us!          The Doorman looks at Phil and Clara - a white, well          dressed suburban couple.           OK. Yeah. Go ahead.          The elevator door opens and they get inside.           Have a nice night.           You too.           As the elevator doors close, Phil and Clara look at each          other, then simultaneously slip PAPER BAGS with EYE and          MOUTH HOLES over their heads.           Mrs. Cardigan, in her frilly nightgown with her eyemask          pulled up on her forehead, walks through her dark living          room toward the POUNDING on her front door.              All right. All-          As Mrs. Cardigan opens the door, Phil and Clara, in their          masks, BUM RUSH her. Screaming, Cardigan dodges, running          back to her desk. Phil and Clara give chase, but          Cardigan grabs a LARGE METAL YARDSTICK and starts          WHOPPING PHIL over and over on his paper bag head,          screaming the whole time.              Clara grabs her from behind, bringing her down.           rubs his paper bag head.                                                                                                              9i.            Jesus!           Having put Cardigan's eyenask back over her eyes, Clara,          bag off, holds Cardigan in a chair as Phil comes back          into the living room holding two spools of FUZZY YARN.           I can't find any rope. Only yarn.           Yarn? Fine. Just use that. I'll start          looking.          Phil gets to work, wrapping the yarn over and over, tying          Cardigan's arms to the back of the chair, while Clara          searches Cardigan's desk.           You two weren't very prepared.           Excuse me?            You should have been more prepared.          Thought ahead and brought the rope          you.           OK, why don't you lay off the critiqu           's not a critique. It's a fact.           Oh is it a fact?           Yes. ng word choice.           Wrong word choice? Unbelievable! Well,          let me throw a little word choice          ""correction"" your way.           Partner!           Five year old kids can't be          ""antagonistic.""                                                                                                                  Phil looks over. Clara makes the ""Cut it out"" gesture          across her throat.           If you're done tying her up, come over          and help.          Phil crosses the room and starts going through notebooks          on the desk.           The name's Cardigan, not Rockefeller, if          you haven't figured it out yet! What          idiots!           You must be such a positive influence on          our youth.           You're one to talk!           Partner!           1�1 Listen, lady, just sit tight and we'll be          out of here before you know it.          Phil picks up and flips quickly through a notebook, when          he spots something and doubles back, starting to read.          His brow furrows.          Clara, deep in her own workbook, suddenly brightens.           Got it!          She notices Phil's expression.           What?          hands the book to Clara to read. She does and          darkens.           Oliver told her he's being mean to Je y          Briggs because... he says he wants to          marry her?            And that's what married people do.                                                                                                                 As this hits them, Phil and Clara look at each other,          then at Mrs. Cardigan, blindfolded in the living room.            What's wrong over there? No ""crown          jewels"" yet?           Let's make the call,           The PHONE RINGS in Mayor Reynold's bedroom. He hops up          and peers at the clock - 4:30 am - then at the caller ID.          CARDIGAN, L. He looks over at his wife who snores loudly          with earplugs in, then picks up the phone, confused.            Lucy? Is everything OK?           On the phone in Cardigan's office, Phil is confused.           Lucy? Who's Lucy?           I'm Lucy.           (stunned',          You and the Mayor are on a first name          basis?           You're calling our Mayor in the middle of          the night?           I had nothing to do with this Charlie!           Charlie?!? Lucy!?!? _ appened to          ""°boundaries matter?„ =_.h? What happened          to that, bitch?           Hey ""partner."" How about you put a sock          in it now.            Who is this ? r1                                                                                                                 You don't know me, Mr. Mayor, but I've          recently come into possession of          something that you were supposed to get          from the Gales tonight.          Silence on the line.           Hello?            And?           And whether you realize it or not, we          ended up doing you a favor. You see,          this man named Mr. Stockton - I          know if you know him-           I know who he is.           Well, he tried to steal the photos from          the Gales. He's even got cops on his          payroll helping him out. We think he was          planning to sabotage your re-election.           So what do you want for them?           What do we want?          Phil looks at Clara.           We just want our lives back. We want to          go home, Mr. Mayor.           The Mayor looks over nervously as his wife stirs. She          goes back to snoring and he whispers into the phone          again.             That's it.          Mayor Diggs breathes out and rubs his forehead.                                                                                                                If you really can get me... what I was          supposed to receive earlier without this          getting out, I promise you I'll take care          of your safety.           But now the police think that-           Trust me. Get me the photos and he won't          be bothering you again.           Clara sees Phil furrow his brow, confused.           is it?          Phil's concentrating hard on something. Thinking.            Uh... yeah. We'll meet you at the Adler          Planetarium in 1 hour. Come alone. E           The Mayor rubs his forehead.           Of course. And... thank you.          Click. The Mayor hangs up the phone and quietly leaves          the bedroom.            Downing a glass of scotch, the Mayor sits at his desk and           lets out a sigh of relief. Beat. He picks up his desk          phone and dials.           We dodged a bullet. They calac _e .           Mr. Stockton sits at his desk, staring at a blueish          monitor screen.                                                                                                                 interesting.          ON STOCKTON'S MONITOR in front of him we see that Frank          and Harry hold a wounded Ray and Dora in the meat locker.           They thought you were stealing the photos          from the Gales to try to blackmail me          yourself.           Did they, now? That's great.           They're going to meet me in an hour with          them. Alone.           st keeps getting better.           Phil and Clara sit silently on the steps of the          beautiful, old Alder Planetarium looking at dawn hitting          the CHICAGO SKYLINE.           Man, I love this city. Always have.           When was the last time we watched the          sunrise together?           Probably the last time we were here.            Nope. it wasn't. It was the morning          that Ollie was born.            You're The morning Ollie was          born.          They look at each other, remembering.           Man, I'm starving!           Me too.           Sorry you never got your truffles.                                                                                                                Clara reaches into her purse.           Who needs white truffles when you've got          a lemon zest Luna bar.          Clara breaks it in two and hands half to Phil. They          click the halves together, toasting each other, then          silently chew, looking out. Phil shakes his head and          starts GIGGLING.           What?            OK, what happened to us tonight?          the hell are we doing here?          Clara starts laughing too.           It's not funny.           No, I know it's not funny. It's not          funny at all.           en why are you laughing?           Why are you laughing?          They're both cracking up... then Phil notices a moment          later that Clara's laughter has turned to            Wha e gonna be OK, Cla           No. It's not that. just... this is          nice. Right now.          (tears up again)          You don't understand... I really don't          want to be Wonder Woman, Phil! I don't          At all!           You don't see that this whole time I'm          flying in a glass plane! In a glass          Mane!            Uh, OK, but I think Wonder Woman actua          flies an invisible plane, not a glass          plane.                                                                                                               This makes Clara break into a bigger round of sobs.           You see! It isn't even there at all! I          don't even have a plane! No plane! I'm          running on fumes!           You're not running on fumes, Clara.           I'm not trying to be uptight, or          controlling! Or a nutrition...           Nazi.           Nazi! I'm just trying the only way I          know how to keep everything from fall          apart!           It won't fall apart. And I really can          help whenever you feel like it is. With          Ollie. Whatever. You just never act          like you need me to.           That's because as it is you see us as a          distraction from your work!           You think I see you guys as a          distraction? God no, Clara.           You don't understand... I have this wife          who does everything better than anyone          I've ever known. And the greatest son.          You want to know why I obsess so much          about my stupid job? Because I want to          feel like... like I can do something good          enough to deserve someone like you. I          mean, I look at you and I jest don't          stack up.           That's crazy, Phil. You do. You're a          god man. You're the best man I know.           I'll never be the guy who remembers          always put toilet paper on the right way.                                                                                                                I don't think I would really want to be          with that guy, Phil. I just... want us          to be on the same team again.          As Clara sniffles, Phil takes this in for a beat. He          nods.           Listen, you know what I said before,          about not being the people we used to be?           Phil, we were angry-           No, Clara. It's true. We're not. And I          know I'm going to drive you crazy again,          and you're definitely going to drive me          crazy. But I wouldn't want to do it with          anybody else.          He hugs her tight.           We had a good fight tonight, didn't we?           Yeah, we did. You know the worst part          about not talking about all this          recently?           What?           We missed out on a lot of make up sex.          And our make up sex woulda rocked!           You think?           Oh yeah.          Phil s when he spots something behind Clara.          MAYOR DIGGS looks both walks from his car in          the parking lot toward the--.           Here we go.           Tell me now. Do you need to pee?           1 hold it.                                                                                                                They get up and start walking down the steps to meet him.           Phil and Clara meet the Mayor at the bottom of the steps.          Clara takes the manila envelope out of her purse, handing          it to him.           This is what you're looking for. I've          tten down our information inside.           And that's it?           That's it. We're going home now.          The Mayor nods, and Phil and Clara start walking past him          toward the parking lot. Mayor Diggs stays behind,          nervously tapping the envelope in his hand.          As Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot, ALL THE MAYOR'S          CAR DOORS OPEN, and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr.          Stockton climb out. Frank and Harry pop the trunk and          grab SHEETS OF CLEAR PLASTIC. Phil's eyes go wide.           Oh God. Run, Clara!          Phil and Clara start to run, when a GUNSHOT hits the          ground in front of them. They turn, when ANOTHER SHOT          rings out.           The next one won't be a warning shot.          They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and          Stockton walk toward them, Harry and Frank behind with          the plastic.           (to Harry and Frank          Let's do it over there.          y and Frank quickly throw the plastic sheets down on          the grass nearby.           I'm going to wait in the c r          don't mind.           Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.                                                                                                               As Mayor Diggs starts to walk back to the parking lot, he          opens the manila envelope. Manning gestures for Phil and          Clara to walk to the plastic sheets.           Please. Please don't do           Over there.           Please! We have a child!           said over there!            Just me then, OK? I promise you she's          not going to say anything! Please! We          have a child!           Last time I'm going to say it.          Resigned, Phil and Clara sadly look at each other, then          walk to stand in front of the plastic on the ground.             On your knees.          Phil, scared, holds out his hand to Clara. She takes          looking back at him and they kneel in front of the          plastic, side by side.          Mr. Stockton nods to Lieutenant Manning, who checks his          gun.            Mr. Stockton and Lieutenant inning turn. Mayor Diggs          sifts through pages of DOCJ J:TTS that were in t h ''w Wila          Envelope.           -eally were planning to give you the          pictures, Mr. Mayor. That is, until you          -.sre so casual about is not needing to          worry about the cop who was after us.          That made me a little suspicious because          I never told you which cop it was.           Then we got to talking and realized how          dumb we were.                                                                                                                 E If you came on to some waitress at the          Rainbow, you must have felt pretty darn          comfortable there.           Which meant Stockton was probably your          buddy.           Where are the pictures?           But we were still confused, because if          you guys are buddies, how do you explain          the Falconwood Corporation?          Mr. Stockton's face blanches.           They're obviously not going to tell us!          Just shoot them!           Wait. I've heard that name. What's the          Falconwood Corporation?           Runs the hiring of inspectors for the          Department of Highways in Chicago. You           know, the ones who have been finding all          those violations?           Manning! I said shoot them!           I work for the Mayor, Terrence.           Why do you keep interrupting, Terrence?           Maybe because according to the paperwork          you've got there, he owns Falconwood.           Not only that, you'll see those other          pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called          Eurostruct - which rents the city all of          its construction equipment.           Frank, Harry!          Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns          his gun on them.                                                                                                                 The more violations Falconwood finds, the          longer Eurostruct rents the equipment.          That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor.          I'm sure that's not a moral problem for          you, but he's kind of screwing you in an          election year, isn't he? Some of us are          pretty pissed off about the roads.          Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it all           You did this to me? I don't get it,          Terrence. Why? How much do you need? I          have the Lieutenant here watch your back          on all of your gambling clubs-           Oh, do you mean the ones that you gamble          at? Where I cover your debts? Those          clubs?           I slipped your company 5 no-bid          foreclosed buildings for a dollar each          downtown.           You think that pays for what I do for          you? The girls I have to pay off? The          jet charters? And let's not even get          into your ""re-election fund""! Let's not          even go there!            Listen to them.          Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket          pocket, shoving it against the back of Phil's neck.           How did you get this? How?           Tha be from me.

I know all about you, buddy.          With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the          WIRES under their clothing. Seeing them hand over the          wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor Diggs what he's just          revealed.           Aw fuck.            Makes you feel any better, I wasn't gonna          vote for you anyway.           either.           As Holbrooke drops Phil and Clara off in front of their          house, his BLACKBERRY buzzes and he checks it.           Everything OK?           Yeah. They just need me downtown in half          an hour for a news conference with the          Deputy Mayor. Want it for the morning          shows.           Don't think they're going to be calling          you the IT guy any-more.           Listen guys, I feel weird about not even          acknowledging you two.           Don't.           But you should be up there with me. You          handed this whole case to me.           (smiles, winks)          Yeah, well-, that's how we roll.          They get out of the car and start up the driveway.                                                                                                                  As Clara opens the front door, Phil slowly bends down,          picking up the morning paper.           Hey hey! Up bright and early, aren          Phil looks over to see his overly cheery neighbor Chaz in          his jogging suit. He smiles, appreciating Chaz for the          first time.           Yep. We sure are.          As he joins Clara on the doorstep, they take each other          in.           You have your presentation in a few          hours.            Yeah. You know, I think I'm gonna be OK.            I had a good time tonight.           Yeah. Me too. It was fun.           It was.           So... let's do this again sometime?            like that.          For the first time the whole night, THEY KISS.

"                                a screenplay by                               James Cameron Then two faint lights appear, close together... growing brighter. Theyresolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES, free-falling toward us like expresselevators.One is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to FILL FRAME, lookinglike a spacecraft blazing with lights, bristling with insectilemanipulators.TILTING DOWN to follow it as it descends away into the limitless blacknessbelow. Soon they are fireflies, then stars. Then gone.  PUSHING IN on one of the falling submersibles, called MIR ONE, right up toits circular viewport to see the occupants.INSIDE, it is a cramped seven foot sphere, crammed with equipment. ANATOLYMIKAILAVICH, the sub's pilot, sits hunched over his controls... singingsoftly in Russian.Next to him on one side is BROCK LOVETT. He's in his late forties, deeplytanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit unzipped to show the gold fromfamous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair. He is a wiley, fast-talkingtreasure hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, part adventurerand part vacuum cleaner salesman. Right now, he is propped against the CO2scrubber, fast asleep and snoring.On the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a bearded wide-bodynamed LEWIS BODINE, sho is also asleep. Lewis is an R.O.V. (REMOTELYOPERATED VEHICLE) pilot and is the resident Titanic expert.Anatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment.  A pale, dead-flat lunar landscape. It gets brighter, lit from above, as MIRONE enters FRAME and drops to the seafloor in a downblast from itsthrusters. It hits bottom after its two hour free-fall with a loud BONK.  Lovett and Bodine jerk awake at the landing.                           (heavy Russian accent)We are here. 5 MINUTES LATER: THE TWO SUBS skim over the seafloor to the sound ofsidescan sonar and the THRUM of big thrusters.6 The featureless gray clay of the bottom unrols in the lights of the subs.Bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, where the outline of a hugepointed object is visible. Anatoly lies prone, driving the sub, his facepressed to the center port. Come left a little. She's right in front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen.Thirteen... you should see it. Do you see it? I don't see it... there!Out of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of the shipappears. Its knife-edge prow is coming straight at us, seeming to plow thebottom sediment like ocean waves. It towers above the seafloor, standingjust as it landed 84 years ago.THE TITANIC. Or what is left of her. Mir One goes up and over the bowrailing, intact except for an overgrowth of ""rusticles"" draping it likemutated Spanish moss.TIGHT ON THE EYEPIECE MONITOR of a video camcorder. Brock Lovett's facefills the BLACK AND WHITE FRAME. It still gets me every time.The image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's shoulder, tothe bow railing visible in the lights beyond. Anatoly turns. Is just your guilt because of estealing from the dead.CUT WIDER, to show that Brock is operating the camera himself, turning itin his hand so it points at his own face. Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here.Brock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, with the cameraaimed at himself at arm's length. It still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great shipsitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912,after her long fall from the world above.Anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles and watchesthe sonar. You are so full of shit, boss.7 Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge anchor whileMir One passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck, with its massiveanchor chains still laid out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass capsgleaming. The 22 foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormouswreck. Dive nine. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic... two and a half milesdown. The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like afreight train going over an ant if our hull fails. These windows are nineinches thick and if they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds.8 Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the Officer'sQuarters. Mir One lands on the roof of the deck hous nearby. Right. Let's go to work.Bodine slips on a pair of 3-D electronic goggles, and grabs the joystickcontrols of the ROV.9 OUTSIDE THE SUB, the ROV, a small orange and black robot called SNOOPDOG, lifts from its cradle and flies forward. Walkin' the dog.SNOOP DOG drives itself away from the sub, paying out its umbilical behindit like a robot yo-yo. Its twin stereo-video cameras swivel like insecteyes. The ROV descends through an open shaft that once was the beautifulFirst Class Grand Staircase.Snoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into the FirstClass Reception Room.SNOOP'S VIDEO POV, moving through the cavernous interior. The remains ofthe ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance movethrough the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow dissolution anddescending rusticle formations. Stalactites of rust hang down so that attimes it looks like a natural grotto, then the scene shifts and the linesof a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen again.MONTAGE STYLE, as Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence:10 A grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side against awall. The keys gleam black and white in the lights.11 A chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire... glinting asSnoop moves around it.12 Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne bottle, thensome WHITE STAR LINE china... a woman's high-top ""granny shoe"". Thensomething eerie: what looks like a child's skull resolves into theporcelain head of a doll.Snoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved. Here and there adoor still hangs on its rusted hinges. An ornate piece of molding, a wallsconce... hint at the grandeur of the past.13 THE ROV turns and goes through a black doorway, entering room B-52, thesitting room of a ""promenade suite"", one of the most luxurious stateroomson Titanic. I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54. Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday. I'm tryin' boss.Glinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near-perfectlypreserved fireplace. An albino Galathea crab crawls over it. Nearby are theremains of a divan and a writing desk. The Dog crosses the ruins of theonce elegant room toward another DOOR. It squeezes through the doorframe,scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides. It moves out of a cloudof rust and keeps on going. I'm crossing the bedroom.The remains of a pillared canopy bed. Broken chairs, a dresser. Through thecollapsed wall of the bathroom, the porcelain commode and bathtub tookalmost new, gleaming in the dark. Okay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door.SEVERAL ANGLES as the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts movingdebris aside. A lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright as they werein 1912. Easy, Lewis. Take it slow.Lewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls itwith Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt. Under it isa dark object. The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was underthe door... Ooohh daddy-oh, are you seein' what I'm seein'?CLOSE ON LOVETT, watching his moniteors. By his expression it is like he isseeing the Holy Grail. Oh baby baby baby.                             (grabs the mike)It's payday, boys.ON THE SCREEN, in the glare of the lights, is the object of their quest: asmall STEEL COMBINATION SAFE.  THE SAFE, dripping wet in the afternoon sun, is lowered onto the deck of aship by a winch cable.We are on the Russian research vessel AKADEMIK MISTISLAV KELDYSH. A crowdhas gathered, including most of the crew of KELDYSH, the sub crews, and ahand-wringing money guy named BOBBY BUELL who represents the limitedpartners. There is also a documentary video crew, hired by Lovett to coverhis moment of glory.Everyone crowds around the safe. In the background Mir Two is being loweredinto its cradle on deck by a massive hydraulic arm. Mir One is alreadyrecovered with Lewis Bodine following Brock Lovett as he bounds over to thesafe like a kid on Christman morning. Who's the best? Say it. You are, Lewis.                            (to the video crew)You rolling? Rolling.Brock nods to his technicians, and they set about drilling the safe'shinges. During this operation, Brock amps the suspense, working the lens tofill the time. Well, here it is, the moment of truth. Here's where we find out if thetime, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, tocome out here to the middle of the North Atlantic... were worth it. If whatwe think is in that same... is in that safe... it will be.Lovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find yet. The dooris pried loose. It clangs onto the deck. Lovett moves closer, peering intothe safe's wet interior. A long moment then... his face says it all. Shit. You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.                          (to the video cameraman)Get that outta my face.  Technicians are carefully removing some papers from the safe and placingthem in a tray of water to separate them safely. Nearby, other artifactsfrom the stateroom are being washed and preserved.Buell is on the satellite phone with the INVESTORS. Lovett is yelling atthe video crew. You send out what I tell you when I tell you. I'm signing your paychecks,not 60 minutes. Now get set up for the uplink.Buell covers the phone and turns to Lovett. The partners want to know how it's going? How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!Lovett grabs the phone from Buell and goes instantly smooth. Hi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn't in the safe... no, look, don't worry aboutit, there're still plenty of places it could be... in the floor debris inthe suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on C deck...                            (seeing something)Hang on a second.A tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side with a tong...revealing a pencil (conte crayon) drawing of a woman.Brock looks closely at the drawing, which is in excellent shape, though itsedges have partially disintegrated. The woman is beautiful, and beautifullyrendered. In her late teens or early twenties, she is nude, though posedwith a kind of casual modesty. She is on an Empire divan, in a pool oflight that seems to radiate outward from her eyes. Scrawled in the lowerright corner is the date: April 14 1912. And the initials JD.The girl is not entirely nude. At her throat is a diamond necklace with onelarge stone hanging in the center.Lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table. It is aperiod black-and-white photo of a diamond necklace on a black velvetjeller's display stand. He holds it next to the drawing. It is clearly thesame piece... a complex setting with a massive central stone which isalmost heart-shaped. I'll be God damned.  A CNN NEWS STORY: a live satellite feed from the deck of the Keldysh,intercut with the CNN studio. Treasure hunter Brock Lovett is best known for finding Spanish gold insunken galleons in the Caribbean. Now he is using deep submergencetechnology to work two and a half miles down at another famous wreck... theTitanic. He is with us live via satellite from a Russian research ship inthe middle of the Atlantic... hello Brock? Yes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is not just A shipwrick, Titanic is THEshipwreck. It's the Mount Everest of shipwrecks.  PULL BACK from the screen, showing the CNN report playing on a TV set inthe living room of a small rustic house. It is full of ceramics, figurines,folk art, the walls crammed with drawings and paintings... things collectedover a lifetime.PANNING to show a glassed-in studio attached to the house. Outside it is aquiet morning in Ojai, California. In the studio, amid incredible clutter,an ANCIENT WOMAN is throwing a pot on a potter's wheel. The liquid red claycovers her hands... hands that are gnarled and age-spotted, but stillsurprisingly strong and supple. A woman in her early forties assists her. I've planned this expedition for three years, and we're out here recoveringsome amazing things... things that will have enormous historical andeducational value. But it's no secret that education is not your main purpose. You're atreasure hunter. So what is the treasure you're hunting? I'd rather show you than tell you, and we think we're very close to doingjust that.The old woman's name is ROSE CALVERT. Her face is a wrinkled mass, her bodyshapeless and shrunken under a one-piece African-print dress.But her eyes are just as bright and alive as those of a young girl.Rose gets up and walks into the living room, wiping pottery clay from herhands with a rag. A Pomeranian dog gets up and comes in with her.The younger soman, LIZZY CALVERT, rushes to help her. Turn that up please, dear. Your expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy over salvagerights and even ethics. Many are calling you a grave robber.  Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb graverobbing. I have museum-trained experts here, making sure this stuff ispreserved and catalogued properly. Look at this drawing, which was foundtoday...The video camera pans off Brock to the drawing, in a tray of water. Theimage of the woman with the necklace FILLS FRAME. ...a piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years... and my team areable to preserve it intanct. Should this have remained unseen at the bottomof the ocean for eternity, when we can see it and enjoy it now...?ROSE is galvanized by this image. Her mouth hangs open in amazement. I'll be God damned.  CUT TO KELDYSH. The Mir subs are being launched. Mir Two is already in thewater, and Lovett is getting ready to climb into Mir One when Bobby Buellruns up to him. There's a satellite call for you. Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water?Take a message. No, trust me, you want to take this call.  Beull hands Lovett the phone, pushing down the blinking line. The call isfrom Rose and we see both ends of the conversation. She is in her kitchenwith a mystified Lizzy. This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs... ? Rose Calvert. ... Mrs. Calvert? I was just wondering if you had found the ""Heart of the Ocean"" yet, Mr.Lovett.Brock almost drops the phone. Bobby sees his shocked expression... I told you you wanted to take this call.                                  (to Rose)Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in thepicture is? Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me.  SMASH CUT TO AN ENORMOUS SEA STALLION HELICOPTER thundering across theocean. PAN 180 degrees as it roars past. There is no land at eitherhorizon. The Keldysh is visible in the distance.CLOSE ON A WINDOW of the monster helicopter. Rose's face is visible,looking out calmly.  Brock and Bodine are watching Mir 2 being sweng over the side to start adive. She's a goddamned liar! A nutcase. Like that... what's her name? ThatAnastasia babe. They're inbound.Brock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the approaching helo. She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on theTitanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now. A hundred and one next month. Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was RoseDawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, hadtwo kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids isdead.The Sea Stallion approaches the ship, BG, forcing Brock to yell over therotors. And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or onthis ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say.Got it?  IN A THUNDERING DOWNBLAST the helicopter's wheels bounce down on thehelipad.Lovett, Buell and Bodine watch as the HELICOPTER CREW CHIEF hands out aboutten suitcases, and then Rose is lowered to the deck in a wheelchair byKeldysh crewmen. Lizzy, ducking unnecessarily under the rotor, follows herout, carrying FREDDY the Pomeranian. The crew chief hands a puzzled Keldyshcrewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it. Rose does not travellight.HOLD ON the incongruous image of this little old lady, looking impossiblyfragile amongst all the high tech gear, grungy deck crew and giganticequipment. S'cuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends.  Lizzy is unpacking Rose's things in the small utilitarian room. Rose isplacing a number of FRAMED PHOTOS on the bureau, arranging them carefullynext to the fishbowl. Brock and Bodine are in the doorway. Is your stateroom alright? Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. Yes. We met just a few minutes ago, grandma. Remember, up on deck? Oh, yes.Brock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. Rose finishesarranging her photographs. We get a general glimpse of them: the usualsnapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband. There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy ofcourse.                            (to the Pomeranian)Isn't that right, sweetie. Would you like anything? I should like to see my drawing.  Rose looks at the drawing in its tray of water, confronting herself acrossa span of 84 years. Until they can figure out the best way to preserve it,they have to keep it immersed. It sways and ripples, almost as if alive.TIGHT ON Rose's ancient eyes, gazing at the drawing.25 FLASHCUT of a man's hand, holding a conte crayon deftly creating ashoulder and the shape of her hair with two efficient lines.26 THE WOMAN'S FACE IN THE DRAWING, dancing under the water.27 A FLASHCUT of a man's eyes, just visible over the top of a sketchingpad. They look up suddenly right into the LENS. Soft eyes, but fearlesslydirect.28 Rose smiles, remembering. Brock has the reference photo of the necklacein his hand. Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of theCrown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything fromthe neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too...recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. TheHeart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond. It was a dreadful, heavy thing.                        (she points at the drawing)I only wore it this once. You actually believe this is you, grandma? It is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number? I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that wassettled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was,Rost? Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace hisson Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a weekbefore he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after thesinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.                                (to Lizzy)See the date? April 14, 1912. If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the dayTitanic sank.                                   (to Rose)And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you foranything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery. I don't want your money, Mr. Lovett. I know how hard it is for people whocare greatly for money to give some away.                                 (skeptical)You don't want anything?                          (indicating the drawing)You may give me this, if anything I tell you is of value. Deal.                            (crossing the room)Over here are a few things we've recovered from your staterooms.Laid out on a worktable are fifty or so objects, from mundane to valuable.Rose, shrunken in her chair, can barely see over the table top. With atrembling hand she lifts a tortoise shell hand mirror, inlaid with motherof pearl. She caresses it wonderingly. This was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the same as the last time I sawit.She turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in the crackedglass. The reflection has changed a bit.She spies something else, a silver and moonstone art-nouveau brooch. My mother's brooch. She wanted to go back for it. Caused quite a fuss.Rose picks up an ornate art-nouveau HAIR COMB. A jade butterfly takesflight on the ebony handle of the comb. She turns it slowly, remembering.We can see that Rose is experiencing a rush of images and emotions thathave lain dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb. Are you ready to go back to Titanic?  It is a darkened room lined with TV monitors. IMAGES OF THE WRECK fill thescreens, fed from Mir One and Two, and the two ROVs, Snoop Dog and DUNCAN. Live from 12,000 feet.ROSE stares raptly at the screens. She is enthraled by one in particular,an image of the bow railing. It obviously means something to her. Brock isstudying her reactions carefully. The bow's struck in the bottom like an axe, from the impact. Here... I canrun a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here.Lizzy turns the chair so Rose can see the screen of Bodine's computer. Ashe is calling up the file, he keeps talking. We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay,here... Rose might not want to see this, Lewis. No, no. It's fine. I'm curious.Bodine starts a COMPUTER ANIMATED GRAPHIC on the screen, which parallelshis rapid-fire narration. She hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along...punching holes like a morse code... dit dit dit, down the side. Now she'sflooding in the                              BODINE (cont'd)forward compartments... and the water spills over the tops of thebulkheads, going aft. As her bow is going down, her stern is coming up...slow at first... and then faster and faster until it's lifting all thatweight, maybe 20 or 30 thousand tons... out of the water and the hull can'tdeal... so SKRTTT!!                (making a sound in time with the animation)... it splits! Right down to the keel, which acts like a big hinge. Now thebow swings down and the stern falls back level... but the weight of the bowpulls the stern up vertical, and then the bow section detaches, heading forthe bottom. The stern bobs like a cork, floods and goes under about 2:20a.m. Two hours and forty minutes after the collision.The animation then follows the bow section as it sinks. Rose watches thisclinical dissection of the disaster without emotion. The bow pulls out of its dive and planes away, almost a half a mile, beforeit hits the bottom going maybe 12 miles an hour. KABOOM!The bow impacts, digging deeply into the bottom, the animation now followsthe stern. The stern implodes as it sinks, from the pressure, and rips apart from theforce of the current as it falls, landing like a big pile of junk.                        (indicating the simulation)Cool huh? Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course theexperience of it was somewhat less clinical. Will you share it with us?Her eyes go back to the screens, showing the sad ruins far below them.A VIEW from one of the subs TRACKING SLOWLY over the boat deck. Roserecognizes one of the Wellin davits, still in place. She hears ghostlywaltz music. The faint and echoing sound of an officer's voice, Englishaccented, calling ""Women and children only"".30 FLASH CUTS of screaming faces in a running crowd. Pandemonium andterror. People crying, praying, kneeling on the deck. Just impressions...flashes in the dark.31 Rose Looks at another monitor. SNOOP DOG moving down a rusted,debris-filled corridor. Rose watches the endless row of doorways slidingpast, like dark mouths.32 IMAGE OF A CHILD, three years old, standing ankle deep in water in themiddle of an endless corridor. The child is lost alone, crying.33 Rose is shaken by the flood of memories and emotions. Her eyes well upand she puts her head down, sobbing quietly.                           (taking the wheelchair)I'm taking her to rest. No!Her voice is surprisingly strong. The sweet little old lady is gone,replaced by a woman with eyes of steel. Lovett signals everyone to stayquiet. Tell us, Rose.She looks from screen to screen, the images of the ruined ship. It's been 84 years... Just tell us what you can--                       (holds up her hand for silence)It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china hadnever been used. The sheets had never been slept in.He switches on the minirecorder and sets it near her. Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. And it was. It really was...As the underwater camera rises past the rusted bow rail, WE DISSOLVE /MATCH MOVE to that same railing in 1912...  SHOT CONTINUES IN A FLORIOUS REVEAL as the gleaming white superstructure ofTitanic rises mountainously beyond the rail, and above that thebuff-colored funnels stand against the sky like the pillars of a greattemple. Crewmen move across the deck, dwarfed by the awesome scale of thesteamer.Southanmpton, England, April 10, 1912. It is almost nnon on ailing day. Acrowd of hundreds blackens the pier next to Titanic like ants on a jellysandwich.IN FG a gorgeous burgundy RENAULT TOURING CAR swings into frame, hangingfrom a loading crane. It is lowered toward HATCH #2.On the pier horsedrawn vehicles, motorcars and lorries move slowly throughthe dense throng. The atmosphere is one of excitement and generalgiddiness. People embrace in tearful farewells, or wave and shout bonvoyage wishes to friends and relatives on the decks above.A white RENAULT, leading a silver-gray DAIMLER-BENZ, pushes through thecrowd leaving a wake in the press of people. Around the handsome carspeople are streaming to board the ship, jostling with hustling seamen andstokers, porters, and barking WHITE STAR LINE officials.The Renault stops and the LIVERIED DRIVER scurries to open the door for aYOUNG WOMAN dressed in a stunning white and purple outfit, with an enormousfeathered hat. She is 17 years old and beautiful, regal of bearing, withpiercing eyes.It is the girl in the drawing. ROSE. She looks up at the ship, taking it inwith cool appraisal. I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than theMauretania.A PERSONAL VALET opens the door on the other side of the car for CALEDONHOCKLEY, the 30 year old heir to the elder Hockley's fortune. ""Cal"" ishandsome, arrogant and rich beyond meaning. You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's overa hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It hassquash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths.Cal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother, RUTH DEWITT BUKATER, whodescends from the touring car being him. Ruth is a 40ish society empress,from one of the most prominent Philadelphia families. She is a widow, andrules her household with iron will. Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.                           (indicating a puddle)Mind your step.                          (gazing at the leviathan)So this is the ship they say is unsinkable. It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.Cal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience.This entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned out, aquintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, complete withservants. Cal's VALET, SPICER LOVEJOY, is a tall and impassive, dour as anundertaker. Behind him emerge TWO MAIDS, personal servants to Ruth andRose.A WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by last minuteloading. Sir, you'll have to check your baggage through the main terminal, roundthat way--Cal nonchalantly hands the man a fiver. The porter's eyes dilate. Fivepounds was a monster tip in those days. I put my faith in you, good sir.                         (curtly, indicating Lovejoy)See my man. Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir.Cal never tires of the effect of money on the unwashed masses.                               (to the porter)These trunks here, and 12 more in the Daimler. We'll have all this lot upin the rooms.The White Star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous pile of steamertrunks and suitcases loading down the second car, including wooden cratesand steel safe. He whistles frantically for some cargo-handlers nearby whocome running.Cal breezes on, leaving the minions to scramble. He quickly checks hispocket watch. We'd better hurry. This way, ladies.He indicates the way toward the first class gangway. They move into thecrowd. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, hustles behind them, laden with bags of hermistress's most recent purchases... things too delicate for the baggagehandlers.Cal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying passengers(mostly second class and steerage) and well-wishers. Most of the firstclass passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd byusing an elevated boarding bridge, twenty feet above.They pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds,queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute. A HEALTH OFFICERexamines their heads one by one, checking scalp and eyelashes for lice.They pass a well-dressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden Biograph""cinematograph"" camera mounted on a tripod. NANIEL MARVIN (whose fatherfounded the Biograph Film Studio) is filming his young bride in front ofthe Titanic. MARY MARVIN stands stiffly and smiles, self conscious. Look up at the ship, darling, that's it. You're amazed! You can't believehow big it is! Like a mountain. That's great.Mary Marvin, without an acting fiber in her body, does a bad Clara Bowpantomime of awe, hands raised.Cal is jostled by two yelling steerage boys who shove past him. And he isbumped again a second later by the boys' father. Steady!! Sorry squire!The Cockney father pushes on, after his kids, shouting. Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath. Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the lastinstant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running alongthe dock like some squalid immigrant family. All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beautyrituals which made us late. You told me to change. I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck. I felt like black.Cal guides them out of the path of a horse-drawn wagon loaded down with twotons of OXFORD MARMALADE, in wooden cases, for Titanic's VictuallingDepartment. Here I've pulled every string I could to book us on the grandest ship inhistory, in her most luxurious suites... and you act as if you're going toyour execution.Rose looks up as the hull of Titanic looms over them...a great iron wall,Bible black and sever. Cal motions her forward, and she enters the gangwayto the D Deck doors with a sense of overwhelming dread. It was the ship of dreams... to everyone else. To me it was a slave ship,taking me back to America in chains.CLOSE ON CAL'S HAND IN SLOW-MOTION as it closes possessively over Rose'sarm. He escorts her up the gangway and the black hull of Titanic swallowsthem. Outwardly I was everything a well brought up girl should be. Inside, I wasscreaming.35 CUT TO a SCREAMING BLAST from the mighty triple steam horns on Titanic'sfunnels, bellowing their departure warning.  A VIEW OF TITANIC from several blocks away, towering above the terminalbuildings like the skyline of a city. The steamer's whistle echoes acrossSouthampton.PULL BACK, revealing that we were looking through a window, and backfurther to show the smoky inside of a pub. It is crowded with dockworkersand ship;s crew.Just inside the window, a poker game is in progress. FOUR MEN, in workingclass clothes, play a very serious hand.JACK DAWSON and FABRIZIO DE ROSSI, both about 20, exchange a glance as theother two players argue in Swedish. Jack is American, a lanky drifter withhis hair a little long for the standards of the times. He is also unshaven,and his clothes are rumpled from sleeping in them. He is an artist, and hasadopted the bohemian style of art scene in Paris. He is also veryself-possessed and sure-footed for 20, having lived on his own since 15.The TWO SWEDES continue their sullen argument, in Swedish.                                 (subtitled)You stupid fishhead. I can't believe you bet our tickets.                                 (subtitled)You lost our money. I'm just trying to get it back. Now shutup and take acard.                                  (jaunty)Hit me again, Sven.Jack takes the card and slips it into his hand.ECU JACK'S EYES. They betray nothing.CLOSE ON FABRIZIO licking his lips nervously as he refuses a card.ECU STACK in the middle of the table. Bills and coins from four counrties.This has been going on for a while. Sitting on top of the money are two 3RDCLASS TICKETS for RMS TITANIC.The Titanic's whistle blows again. Final warning. The moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change.Fabrizio puts his cards down. So do the Swedes. Jack holds his close. Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh...two pair... mmm.                           (turns to his friend)Sorry Fabrizio. What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa dicazzo-- Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...He slaps a full house down on the table.                                 (grinning)'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys! Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!The table explodes into shouting in several languages. Jack rakes in themoney and the tickets.                               (to the Swedes)Sorry boys. Three of a kind and a pair. I'm high and you're dry and...                               (to Fabrizio)... we're going to--  Olaf balls up one huge farmer's fist. We think he's going to clobber Jack,but he swings round and punches Sven, who flops backward onto the floor andsits there, looking depressed. Olaf forgets about Jack and Fabrizio, whoare dancing around, and goes into a rapid harangue of his stupid cousin.Jack kisses the tickets, then jumps on Fabrizio's back and rides him aroundthe pub. It's like they won the lottery. Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot-dogs! Onthe TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamnedroyalty, ragazzo mio!! You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be amillionaire!!                                (to pubkeeper)Capito?? I go to America!! No, mate. Titanic go to America. In five minutes. Shit!! Come on, Fabri!                          (grabbing their stuff)Come on!!                            (to all, grinning)It's been grand.They run for the door. 'Course I'm sure if they knew it was you lot comin', they'd be pleased towait!   Jack and Fabrizio, carrying everything they own in the world in the kitbags on their shoulders, sprint toward the pier. They tear through millingcrowds next to the terminal. Shouts go up behind them as they jostleslow-moving gentlemen. They dodge piles of luggage, and weave throughgroups of people. They burst out onto the pier and Jack comes to a deadstop... staring at the cast wall of the ship's hull, towering seven storiesabove the wharf and over an eighth of a mile long. The Titanic ismonstrous.Fabrizio runs back and grabs Jack, and they sprint toward the third classgangway aft, at E deck. They reach the bottom of the ramp just as SIXTHOFFICER MOODY detaches it at the top. It starts to swing down from thegangway doors. Wait!! We're passengers!Flushed and panting, he waves the tickets. Have you been through the inspection queue?                             (lying cheerfully)Of course! Anyway, we don't have lice, we're Americans.                           (glances at Fabrizio)Both of us.                                   (testy)Right, come aboard.Moody has QUARTERMASTER ROWE reattach the gangway. Jack and Fabrizio comeaboard. Moody glances at the tickets, then passes Jack and Fabrizio throughto Rowe. Rowe looks at the names on the tickets to enter them in thepassenger list. Gundersen. And...                           (reading Fabrizio's)Gundersen.He hands the tickets back, eyeing Fabrizio's Mediterranean lookssuspiciously.                          (grabbing Fabrizio's arm)Come on, Sven.Jack and Fabrizio whoop with victory as they run down the white-paintedcorridero... grinning from ear to ear. We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world!   The mooring lines, as big around as a man's arm, are dropped into thewater. A cheer goes up on the pier as SEVEN TUGS pull the Titanic away fromthe quay.  JACK AND FABRIZIO burst through a door onto the aft well deck. TRACKINGWITH THEM as they run across the deck and up the steel stairs to the poopdeck. They get to the rail and Jack starts to yell and wave to the crowd onthe dock. You know somebody? Of course not. That's not the point.                              (to the crowd)Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!Grinning, Fabrixio joins in, adding his voice to the swell of voices,feeling the exhilaration of the moment. Goodbye! I will never forget you!!   The crowd of cheering well-wishers waves heartily as a black wall of metalmoves past them. Impossibly tiny figues wave back from the ship's rails.Titanic gathers speed.  IN A LONG LENS SHOT the prow of Titanic FILLS FRAME behind the lead tug,which is dwarfed. The bow wave spreads before the mighty plow of theliner's hull as it moves down the River Test toward the English Channel.  Jack and Fabrizio walk down a narrow corridor with doors lining both sideslike a college dorm. Total confusion as people argue over luggage inseveral languages, or wander in confusion in the labyrinth. They passemigrants studying the signs over the doors, and looking up the words inphrase books.They find their berth. It is a modest cubicle, painted enamel white, withfour bunks. Exposed pipes overhead. The other two guys are already there.OLAUS and BJORN GUNDERSEN.Jack throws his kit on one open bunk, while Fabrizio takes the other.                           (in Swedish/ subtitled)Where is Sven?  By contrast, the so-called ""Millionaire Suite"" is in the Empire style, andcomprises two bedrooms, a bath, WC, wardrobe room, and a large sittingroom. In addition there is a private 50 foot promenade deck outside.A room service waiter pours champagne into a tulip glass of orange juiceand hands the Bucks Fizz to Rose. She is looking through her new paintings.There is a Monet of water lilies, a Degas of dancers, and a few abstractworks. They are all unknown paintings... lost works.Cal is out on the covered deck, which has potted trees and vines ontrellises, talking through the doorway to Rose in the sitting room. Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.                       (looking at a cubist portrait)You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth withoutlogic. What's his name again... ?                         (reading off the canvas)Picasso.                       (coming into the sitting room)He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.A porter wheels Cal's private safe (which we recognize) into the room on ahandtruck. Put that in the wardrobe.47 IN THE BEDROOM Rose enters with the large Degas of the dancers. She setsit on the dresser, near the canopy bed. Trudy is already in there, hangingup some of Rose's clothes. It smells so brand new. Like they built it all just for us. I mean... justto think that tonight, when I crawl between the sheets, Iill be the first--Cal appears in the doorway of the bedroom.                              (looking at Rose)And when I crawl between the sheets tonight, I'll still be the first.                         (blushing at the innuendo)S'cuse me, Miss.She edges around Cal and makes a quick exit. Cal comes up behind Rose andputs his hands on her shoulders. An act of possession, not intimacy. The first and only. Forever.Rose's expression shows how bleak a prospect this is for her, now.  Titanic stands silhouetted against a purple post-sunset sky. She is lit uplike a floating palace, and her thousand portholes reflect in the calmharbor waters. The 150 foot tender Nomadic lies-to alongside, looking likea rowboat. The lights of a Cherbourg harbor complete the postcard image.  Entering the first class reception room from the tender are a number ofprominent passengers. A BROAD-SHOULDERED WOMAN in an enormous feathered hatcomes up the gangway, carrying a suitcase in each hand, a spindly porterrunning to catch up with her to take the bags. Well, I wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny. Take 'em the rest ofthe way if you think you can manage. At Cherbourg a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown, but we all calledher Molly. History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her husbandhad struck gold someplace out west, and she was what mother called ""newmoney"".At 45, MOLLY BROWN is a tough talking straightshooter who dresses in thefinery of her genteel peers but will never be one of them. By the next afternoon we had made our final stop and we were steaming westfrom the coast of Ireland, with nothing out ahead of us but ocean...   The ship glows with the warm creamy light of late afternoon. Jack andFabrizio stand right at the bow gripping the curving railing so familiarfrom images of the wreck. Jack leans over, looking down fifty feet to wherethe prow cuts the surface like a knife, sending up two glassy sheets ofwater.  ON THE BRIDGE, CAPTAIN SMITH turns from the binnacle to FIRST OFFICER  Take her to sea Mister Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs.Murdoch moves the engine telegraph lever to ALL AHEAD FULL.53 NOW BEGINS a kind of musical/visual setpiece... an ode to the greatship. The music is rhythmic, surging forward, with a soaring melody thataddresses the majesty and optimism of the ship of dreams.IN THE ENGINE ROOM the telegraph clangs and moves to ""All Ahead Full"". All ahead full!On the catwalk THOMAS ANDREWS, the shipbuilder, watches carefully as theengineers and greasers scramble to adjust valves. Towering above them arethe twin RECIPROCATING engines, four stories tall, their ten-foot-longconnecting rods surging up and down with the turning of the massivecrankshafts. The engines thunder like the footfalls of marching giants.54 IN THE BOILER ROOMS the STOKERS chant a song as they hurl coal into theroaring furnaces. The ""black gang"" are covered with sweat and coal dust,their muscles working like part of the machinery as they toil in thehellish glow.55 UNDERWATER the enormous bronze screws chop through the water, hurlingthe steamer forward and churning up a vortex of foam that lingers for milesbehind the juggernaut ship. Smoke pours from the funnels as--56 The riven water flares higher at the bow as the ship's speeds builds.THE CAMERA SWEEPS UP the prow to find Jack, the wind streaming through hishair and--57 Captain Smith steps out of the enclosed bridge onto the wing. He standswith his hands on the rail, looking every bit the storybook picture of aCaptain... a great patriarch of the sea. Twenty one knots, sir! She's got a bone in her teeth now, eh, Mr. Murdoch.Smith accepts a cup of tea from FIFTH OFFICER LOWE. He contentedly watchesthe white V of water hurled outward from the bows like an expression of hisown personal power. They are invulnerable, towering over the sea.58 AT THE BOW Jack and Fabrizio lean far over, looking down.In the glassy bow-wave two dolphins appear, under the water, running fastjust in front of the steel blade of the prow. They do it for the sheer joyand exultation of motion. Jack watches the dolphins and grins. They breach,jumping clear of the water and then dive back, crisscrossing in front ofthe bow, dancing ahead of the juggernaut.FABRIZIO looks forward across the Atlantic, staring into the sunsparkles. I can see the Statue of Liberty already.                            (grinning at Jack)Very small... of course.THE CAMERA ARCS around them, until they are framed against the sea.NOW WE PULL BACK, across the forecastle deck. Rising, as we continue back,and the ships rolls endlessly forward underneath. Over the bridge wing,along the boat deck until her funnels come INTO FRAME besides us and marchpast like the pillars of heaven, one by one. We pull back and up, until weare looking down the funnels, and the people strolling on the decks andstanding at the rail become antlike.And still we pull back until the great lady is seen whole in a gorgeousaerial portrait, black and severe in her majesty. She is the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in allhistory...  CLOSE ON J. BRUCE ISMAY, Managing Director of White Star Line. ...and our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews here, designed her from the keelplates up.He indicates a handsome 39 year old Irish gentlemen to his right, THOMASANDREWS, of Harland and Wolf Shipbuilders.WIDER, showing the group assembled for lunch the next day. Ismay seatedwith Cal, Rose, Ruth, Molly Brown and Thomas Andrews in the Palm Court, abeautiful sunny spot enclosed by high arched windows.                          (disliking the attention)Well, I may have knocked her together, but the idea was Mr. Ismay's. Heenvisioned a steamer so grand in scale, and so luxurious in itsappointments, that its supremacy would never be challenged. And here sheis...                           (he slaps the table)...willed into solid reality. Why're ships always bein' called ""she""? Is it because men think half thewomen around have big sterns and should be weighed in tonnage?                             (they all laugh)Just another example of the men settin' the rules their way.The waiter arrives to take orders. Rose lights a cigarette. You know I don't like that, Rose. She knows.Cal takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out.                               (to the waiter)We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with a little mint sauce.                  (to Rose, after the waiter moves away)You like lamb, don't you sweetpea?Molly is watching the dynamic between Rose, Cal and Ruth. So, you gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?                            (turning to Ismay)Hey, who came up with the name Titanic? You, Bruce? Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability,luxury... and safety-- Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the male preoccupation with sizemight be of particular interest to you, Mr. Ismay.Andrews chockes on his breadstick, suppressing laughter. My God, Rose, what's gotten into-- Excuse me.She stalks away.                                 (mortified)I do apologize. She's a pistol, Cal. You sure you can handle her?                       (tense but feigning unconcern)Well, I may have to start minding what she reads from now on.  Jack sits on a bench in the sun. Titanic's wake spreads out behind him tothe horizon. He has his knees pulled up, supporting a leather boundsketching pad, his only valuable possession. With conte crayon he drawsrapidly, using sure strokes. An emigrant from Manchester named CARTMELL hashis 3 year old daughter CORA standing on the lower rung of the rail. She isleaned back against his beer barrel of a stomach, watching the seagulls.THE SKETCH captures them perfectly, with a great sense of the humanity ofthe moment. Jack is good. Really good. Fabrizio looks over Jack's shoulder.He nods appreciatively.TOMMY RYAN, a scowling young Irish emigrant, watches as a crewmember comesby, walking three small dogs around the deck. One of them, a BLACK FRENCHBULLDOG, is among the ugliest creatures on the planet. That's typical. First class dogs come down here to take a shit.Jack looks up from his sketch. That's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things. Like we could forget.Jack glances across the well deck. At the aft railing of B deck promenadestands ROSE, in a long yellow dress and white gloves.CLOSE ON JACK, unable to take his eyes off of her. They are across fromeach other, about 60 feet apart, with the well deck like a valley betweenthem. She on her promontory, he on his much lower one. She stares down atthe water.He watches her unpin her elaborate hat and take it off. She looks at thefrilly absurd thing, then tosses it over the rail. It sails far down to thewater and is carried away, astern. A spot of yellow in the vast ocean. Heis riveted by her. She looks like a figure in a romantic novel, sad andisolated.Fabrizio taps Tommy and they both look at Jack gazin at Rose. Fabrizio andTommy grin at each other.Rose turns suddenly and looks right at Jack. He is caught staring, but hedoesn't look away. She does, but then looks back. Their eyes meet acrossthe space of the well deck, across the gulf between worlds.Jack sees a man (Cal) come up behind her and take her arm. She jerks herarm away. They argue in pantomime. She storms away, and he goes after her,disappearing along the A-deck promenade. Jack stares after her. Forget it, boyo. You'd as like have angels fly out o' yer arse as get nextto the likes o' her.  SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON ROSE as she sits, flanked by people in heatedconversation. Cal and Ruth are laughing together, while on the other sideLADY DUFF-GORDON is holding forth animatedly. We don't hear what they aresaying. Rose is staring at her plate, barely listening to theinconsequential babble around her. I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it... an endless parade ofparties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches... always the same narrowpeople, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a greatprecipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared... or evennoticed.ANGLE BENEATH TABLE showing Rose's hand, holding a tiny fork from her crabsalad. She pokes the crab-fork into the skin of her arm, harder and harderuntil it draws blood.  Rose walks along the corridor. A steward coming the other way greets her,and she nods with a slight smile. She is perfectly composed.  She enters the room. Stands in the middle, staring at her reflection in thelarge vanity mirror. Just stands there, then--With a primal, anguished cry she claws at her throat, ripping off her pearlnecklace, which explodes across the room. In a frenzy she tears at herself,her clothes, her hair... then attacks the room. She flings everything offthe dresser and it flies clattering against the wall. She hurls ahandmirror against the vanity, cracking it.  Rose runs along the B deck promenade. She is dishevelled, her hair flying.She is crying, her cheeks streaked with tears. But also angry, furious!Shaking with emotions she doesn't understand... hatred, self-hatred,desperation. A strolling couple watch her pass. Shocked at the emotionaldisplay in public.  Jack is kicked back on one of the benches gazing at the stars blazinggloriously overhead. Thinking artist thoughts and smoking a cigarette.Hearing something, he turns as Rose runs up the stairs from the well deck.They are the only two on the stern deck, except for QUARTERMASTER ROWE,twenty feet above them on the docking bridge catwalk. She doesn't see Jackin the shadows, and runs right past him.TRACKING WITH ROSE as she runs across the deserted fantail. Her breathhitches in an occasional sob, which she suppresses. Rose slams against thebase of the stern flagpole and clings there, panting. She stares out at theblack water.Then starts to climb over the railing. She has to hitch her long dress wayup, and climbing is clumsy. Moving methodically she turns her body and getsher heels on the white-painted gunwale, her back to the railing, facing outtoward blackness. 60 feet below her, the massive propellers are churningthe atlantin into white foam, and a ghostly wake trails off toward thehorizon.IN A LOW ANGLE, we see Rose standing like a figurehead in reverse. Belowher are the huge letters of the name ""TITANIC"".She leans out, her arms straightening... looking down hypnotized, into thevortex below her. Her dress and hair are lifted by the wind of the ship'smovement. The only sound, above the rush of water below, is the flutter andsnap of the big Union Jack right above her. Don't do it.She whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes a second forher eyes to focus. Stay back! Don't come any closer!Jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the sternrunning lights. Take my hand. I'll pull you back in. No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. No you won't. What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and willnot do. You don't know me. You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.Rose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so shewipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance. You're distracting me. Go away. I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you. Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.He takes off his jacket. I'm a good swimmer.He starts unlacing his left shoe. The fall alone would kill you. It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot moreconcerned about the water being so cold.She looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in. How cold?                         (taking off his left shoe)Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.He starts unlacing his right shoe. Ever been to Wisconsin?                                 (perplexed)No. Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there,near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father wereice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole inthe-- I know what ice fishing is! Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went throughsome thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right downthere... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can'tbreath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.                        (takes off his other shoe)Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like Isaid, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back overthe rail and get me off the hook here. You're crazy. That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the onehanging off the back of a ship.He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse. Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand.Rose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and theysomehow suddenly seem to fill her universe. Alright.She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. Hereaches out to take it, firmly. I'm Jack Dawson.                              (voice quavering)Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.Rose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height isterrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turningto face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, andone foot slips off the edge of the deck.She plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, isjerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand.QUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads forthe ladder.   I've got you. I won't let go.Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railingwith his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smoothhull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get anyfooting in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMSagain.Jack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as sheflails, gets her over the railing. They fall together onto the deck in atangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top ofher.Rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drilland sprints across the fantail. Here, what's all this?!Rowe runs up and pulls Jack off of Rose, revealing her dishevelled andsobbing on the deck. Her dress is torn, and the hem is pushing up above herknees, showing one ripped stocking. He looks at Jack, the shaggy steerageman with his jacket off, and the first class lady clearly in distress, andstarts drawing conclusions. Two seamen chug across the deck to join them.                                  (to Jack)Here you, stand back! Don't move an inch!                              (to the seamen)Fetch the Master at Arms.  A few minutes later. Jack is being detained by the burly MASTER AT ARMS,the closest thing to a cop on board. He is handcuffing Jack. Cal is rightin front of Jack, and furious. He has obviously just rushed out here withLovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tieevening dress. The other man is COLONEL ARCHIBALD GRACIE, a mustachioedblowhard who still has his brandy snifter. He offers it to Rose, who ishunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. Cal is moreconcerned with Jack. He grabs him by the lapels. What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me,you filth! What did you think you were doing?! Cal, stop! It was an accident. An accident?! It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.Rose looks at Jack, getting eye contact. I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and Iwould have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almostwent over himself. You wanted to see the propellers?                             (shaking his head)Women and machinery do not mix.                                  (to Jack)Was that the way of it?Rose is begging him with her eyes not to say what really happened. Uh huh. That was pretty much it.He looks at Rose a moment longer. Now they have a secret together. Well! The boy's a hero then. Good for you son, well done!                                 (to Cal)So it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh?Jack is uncuffed. Cal gets Rose to her feet and moving.                             (rubbing her arms)Let's get you in. You're freezing.Cal is leaving without a second thought for Jack.                                    (low)Ah... perhaps a little something for the boy? Oh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty should do it. Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love? Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?Cal turns back to Jack. He appraises him condescendingly... a steerageruffian, unwashed and ill-mannered. I know.                                 (to Jack)Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group withyour heroic tale?                         (looking straight at Rose)Sure. Count me in. Good. Settled then.Cal turns to go, putting a protective arm around Rose. he leans close toGracie as they walk away. This should be amusing.                             (as Lovejoy passes)Can I bum a cigarette?Lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps itopen. Jack takes a cigarette, then another, popping it behind his ear forlater. Lovejoy lights Jack's cigarette. You'll want to tie those.                         (Jack looks at his shoes)Interesting that the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and youstill had time to take of your jacket and shoes. Mmmm?Lovejoy's expression is bland, but the eyes are cold. He turns away to joinhis group.  As she undresses for bed Rose sees Cal standing in her doorway, reflectedin the cracked mirror of her vanity. He comes toward her.                            (unexpectedly tender)I know you've een melancholy, and I don't pretent to know why.From behind his back he hands her a large black velvet jewel case. Shetakes it, numbly. I intended to save this till the engagement gals next week. But I thoughttonight, perhaps a reminder of my feeling for you...Rose slowly opens the box. Inside is the necklace... ""HEART OF THE OCEAN""in all its glory. It is huge... a malevolent blue stone glittering with aninfinity of scalpel-like inner reflections. My God... Cal. Is it a-- Daimond. Yes it is. 56 carats.He takes the necklace and during the following places it around her throat.He turns her to the mirror, staring behind her. It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer,the-- The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.He gazes at the image of the two of them in the mirror. It's for royalty. And we are royalty.His fingers caress her neck and throat. He seems himself to be disarmed byRose's elegance and beauty. His emotion is, for the first time, unguarded. There's nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you if youwould deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose.CAMERA begins to TRACK IN ON ROSE. Closer and closer, during the following: Of course his gift was only to reflect light back onto himself, toilluminate the greatness that was Caledon Hockley. It was a cold stone... aheart of ice.Finally, when Rose's eyes FILL FRAM, we MORPH SLOWLY to her eyes as the arenow... transforming through 84 years of life...  Without a cut the wrinkled, weathered landscape of age has appeared aroundher eyes. But the eyes themselves are the same. After all these years, feel it closing around my throat like a dog collar.THE CAMERA PUllS BACK to show her whole face. I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it... Well, that's the general idea, my dear. So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off theTitanic?                               (he guffaws)That's great!                                 (warningly)Lewis...But Rose laughs with Bodine.                              (still laughing)All you had to do was wait two days!Lovett, standing out of Rose's sightline, checks his watch. Hours havepassed. This process is taking too long. Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it afterthat? Im afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.Lizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out. Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to thesafe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination? That's enough.Lizzy takes her out. Rose's old hand reapears at the doorway in a frailwave goodbye.  As the big hydraulic jib swings one of the Mir subs out over the water.Lovett walks as he talks with Bobby Buell, the partners' rep. They weaveamong deck cranes, launch crew, sub maintenance guys. The partners are pissed. Bobby, buy me time. I need time. We're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over. I'm tellingyou what they're telling me. The hand is on the plug. It's starting topull. Well you tell the hand I need another two days! Bobby, Bobby, Bobby...we're close! I smell it. I smell ice. She had the diamond on... now we justhave to find out where it wound up. I just gotta work her a bit more. Okay?Brock turns and sees Lizy standing behind him. She has overheard the pastpart of his dialogue with Buell. He goes to her and hustles her away fromBuell, toward a quite spot on the deck. Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second. Don't you mean work me? Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help. I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and  one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.                       (with undisguised desperation)Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heartof the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife evendivorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma'smemory.                          (he holds out his hand)You see this? Right here?She looks at his hand, palm up. Empty. Cupped, as if around an imaginaryshape. What? That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand?I'm not leaving here without it. Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget,she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what theyare. Maybe she wants to make peace with the past. What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being onthe Titanic until two days ago. Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.                             (looks at him hard)You think she was really there? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.  Bodine starts the tape recorder. Rose is gazing at the screen seeing THELIVE FEED FROM THE WRECK--SNOOP DOG is moving along the starboard side ofthe hull, heading aft. The rectangular windows of A deck (forward) marchpast on the right. The next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt.  MATCH DISSOLVE from the rusting hulk to the gleaming new Titanic in 1912,passing the end of the enclosed promenade just as Rose walks into thesunlight right in front of us. She is stunningly dressed and walking withpurpose. As if I hadn't felt the sun in years.IT IS SATURDAY APRIL 13, 1912. Rose unlatches the gate to go down intothird class. The steerage men on the deck stop what they're doing and stareat her.  The social center of steerage life. It is stark by comparison to theopulence of first class, but is a loud, boisterous place. There are motherswith babies, kids running between the benches yelling in several languagesand being scolded in several more. There are old women yelling, men playingchess, girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels. There is even anupright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around it.Three boys, shrieking and shouting, are scrambling around chasing a ratunder the benches, trying to whomp it with a shoe and causing generalhavoc. Jack is playing with 5 year old CORA CARTMeLL, drawing funny facestogether in his sketchbook.Fabrizio is struggling to get a conversation going with an attractiveNorwegian girl, HELGA DAHL, sitting with her family at a table across theroom. No Italian? Some little English? No, no. Norwegian. Only.Helga's eye is caught by something. Fabrizio looks, does a take... andJack, curious, follows their gaze to see...Rose, coming toward them. The activity in the room stops... a hush falls.Rose feels suddenly self-conscious as the steerage passengers stare openlyat this princess, some with resentment, others with awe. She spots Jack andgives a little smile, walking straight to him. He rises to meet her,smiling. Hello Jack.Fabrizio and Tommy are floored. Its like the slipper fitting Cinderella. Hello again. Could I speak to you in private? Uh, yes. Of course. After you.He motions her ahead and follows. Jack glances over his shoulder, oneeyebrow raised, as he walks out with her leaving a stunned silence.  Jack and Rose walk side by side. They pass people reading and talking insteamer chairs, some of whom glance curiously at the mismatched couple. Hefeels out of place in his rough clothes. They are both awkward, fordifferent reasons. So, you got a name by the way? Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater. That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.There is an awkward pause. Mr. Dawson, I-- Jack. Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up thenerve to face you. Well, here you are. Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... forpulling me back. But for your discretion. You're welcome. Rose. Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What doesshe know about misery? That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could havehappened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out. I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it wastheir whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.                                (in a rush)I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at theback rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough.Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, Iwas over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry! Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.                            (she lowers her head)Oh God, I am such an utter fool. That penguin last night, is he one of them? Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them. Is he your boyfriend? Worse I'm afraid.She shows him her engagement ring. A sizable diamond. Gawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom.They laugh together. A passing steward scowls at Jack, who is clearly not afirst class passenger, but Rose just glares at him away. So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you'remarryin' this fella. Yes, exactly! So don't marry him. If only it were that simple. It is that simple. Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world. Well, I guess I will tonight.Looking for another topic, any other topic, she indicates his sketchbook. What's this? Just some sketches. May I?The question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed the book. Shesits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook. ON JACK'S sketches... eachone an expressive little bit of humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleepingman, a father and daughter at the rail. The faces are luminous and alive.His book is a celebration of the human condition. Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are. Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.Some loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind. Jack scramblesafter them... catching two, but the rest are gone, over the rail. Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly! Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.He snaps his wrist, shaking his drawing hand in a flourish. I just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway.For emphasis he throws away the two he caught. They sail off.                                 (laughing)You're deranged!She goes back to the book, turning a page. Well, well...She has come upon a series of nudes. Rose is transfixed by the languidbeauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive handsand eyes. They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form...almost uncomfortably intimate. Rose blushes, raising the book as somestrollers go by.                          (trying to be very adult)And these were drawn from life? Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing taketheir clothes off.She studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half in sunlight,half in shadow. Her hands lie at her chin, one furled and one open like aflower, languid and graceful. The drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz printof Georgia O'Keefe. You liked this woman. You used her several times. She had beautiful hands.                                  (smiling)I think you must have had a love affair with her...                                 (laughing)No, no! Just with her hands.                       (looking up from the drawings)You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. I see you.There it is. That piercing gaze again. And...? You wouldn'ta jumped.  Ruth is having tea with NOEL LUCY MARTHA DYER-EDWARDES, the COUNTESS OFROTHES, a 35ish English blue-blood with patirician features. Ruth seessomeone coming across the room and lowers her voice. Oh no, that vulgar Brown woman is coming this way. Get up, quickly beforeshe sits with us.Molly Brown walks up, greeting them cheerfully as they are rising. Hello girls, I was hoping I'd catch you at tea. We're awfully sorry you missed it. The Countess and I are just off to takethe air on the boat deck. That sounds great. Let's go. I need to catch up on the gossip.Ruth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the Grand Staircase togo up. TRACKING WITH THEM, as they cross the room, the SHOT HANDS OFF toBruce Ismay and Captain Smith at another table. So you've not lit the last four boilers then? No, but we're making excellent time.                                (impatiently)Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speedtoo. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage ofTitnaic must make headlines! I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in. Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what aglorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday nightand surprise them all.                    (Ismay slaps his hand on the table)Retire with a bang, eh, E.J?A beat. Then Smith nods, stiffy.  Rose and Jack stroll aft, past people lounging on deck chairs in theslanting late-afternoon light. Stewards scurry to serve tea or hot cocoa.                            (girlish and excited)You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become anartist... living in a garret, poor but free!                                 (laughing)You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever anycaviar.                             (angry in a flash)Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing mydreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head. I'm sorry. Really... I am. Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know whatit is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. LikeIsadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...She leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. Then she seessomething ahead and her face lights up. ...or a moving picture actress!She takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward--DANIEL AND MARY MARVIN. Daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera asshe poses stiffly at the rail. You're sad. Sad, sad, sad. You've left your lover on the shore. You maynever see him agian. Try to be sadder, darling.SUDDENLY Rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical pose at therail next to Mary. Mary bursts out laughing. Rose pulls Jack into thepicture and makes him pose.Marvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing. We see this in CUTS, withmusic and no dialogue. Rose posing tragically at the rail, the back of her hand to her forehead.Jack on a deck chair, pretending to be a Pasha, the two girls pantomimingfanning him like slave girls.Jack, on his knees, pleading with his hands clasped while Rose, standing,turns her head in bored disdain.Rose cranking the camera, while Daniel and Jack have a western shoot-out.Jack wins and leers into the lens, twirling an air mustache like SnidelyWhiplash.  Painted with orange light, Jack and Rose lean on the A-deck rail aft,shoulder to shoulder. The ship's lights come on.It is a magical moment... perfect. So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to LosAngelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have arollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece. A whole ten cents?!                              (not getting it)Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. Butonly in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what thereal artists were doing.                           (looks at the dusk sky)Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feellike it.                             (turning to him)Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever justtalk about it. Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoasteruntil we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in thesurf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff. You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me? Sure. If you like.                              (smiling at him)I think I would.                        (she looks at the horizon)And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit.It's unfair. They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watchclosely.He spits. It arcs out over the water. Your turn.Rose screws up her mouth and spits. A pathetic little bit of foamy spittlewhich mostly runs down her chin before falling off into the water. Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like this... you hawk it down... HHHNNNK!...then roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breathand PLOOOW!! You see the range on that thing?She goes through the steps. Hawks it down, etc. He coaches her through it(ad lib) while doing the steps himself. She lets fly. So does he. Twocomets of gob fly out over the water. That was great!Rose turns to him, her face alight. Suddenly she blanches. He sees herexpression and turns.RUTH, the Countess of Rothes, and Molly Brown have been watching themhawking lugees. Rose becomes instantly composed. Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson. Charmed, I'm sure.Jack has a little spit running down his chin. He doesn't know it. MollyBrown is grinning. As Rose proceeds with the introductions, we hear... The others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life. Butmy mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect which must besquashed quickly. Well, Jack, it sounds like you're a good man to have around in a stickyspot--They all jump as a BUGLER sounds the meal call right behind them. Why do they insist on always announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge? Shall we go dress, mother?                            (over her shoulder)See you at dinner, Jack.                             (as they walk away)Rose, look at you... out in the sun with no hat. Honestly!The Countess exits with Ruth and Rose, leaving Jack and Molly alone ondeck. Son, do you have the slightest comprehension of what you're doing? Not really. Well, you're about to go into the snakepit. I hope you're ready. What areyou planning to wear?Jack looks down at his clothes. Back up at her. He hadn't thought aboutthat. I figured.  Men's suits and jackets and formal wear are strewn all over the place.Molly is having a fine time. Jack is dressed, except for his jacket, andMolly is tying his bow tie. Don't feel bad about it. My husband still can't tie one of these damnthings after 20 years. There you go.She picks up a jacket off the bed and hands it to him. Jack goes into thebathroom to put it on. Molly starts picking up the stuff off the bed. I gotta buy everything in three sizes 'cause I never know how much he'sbeen eating while I'm away.She turns and sees him, though we don't. My, my, my... you shine up like a new penny. 78 EXT. BOAT DECK / FIRST CLAsS ENTRANCE - DUSKA purple sky, shot with orange, in the west. Drifting strains of classicmusic. We TRACK WITH JACK along the deck. By Edwardian standards he looksbadass. Dashing in his borrowed white-tie outfit, right down to his pearlstuds.A steward bows and smartly opens the door to the First Class Entrance. Good evening, sir.Jack plays the role smoothly. Nods with just the right degree of disdain.  Jack steps in and his breath is taken away by the splendor spread outbefore him. Overhead is the enormous glass dome, with a crystal chandelierat its center. Sweeping down six stories is the First Class GrandStaircase, the epitome of the opulent naval architecture of the time.And the people: the women in their floor length dresses, elaboratehairstyles and abundant jewelry... the gentlemen in evening dress, standingwith one hand at the small of the back, talking quietly.Jack descends to A deck. Several men nod a perfunctory greeting. He nodsback, keeping it simple. He feels like a spy.Cal comes down the stairs, with Ruth on his arm, covered in jewelry. Theyboth walk right past Jack, neither one gecognizeing him. Cal nods at him,one gent to another. But Jack barely has time to be amused. Because justbehind Cal and Ruth on the stairs is Rose, a vision in red and black, herlow-cut dress showing off her neck and shoulders, her arms seathed in whitegloves that come well above above the elbow. Jack is hypnotized by herbeauty.CLOSE ON ROSE as she approaches Jack. He imitates the gentlemen's stance,hand behind his back. She extends her gloved hand and he takes it, kissingthe back of her fingers. Rose flushes, beaming noticeably. She can't takeher eyes off him. I saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always wanted to do it. Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.                             (caught off guard)Dawson! I didn't recognize you.                               (studies him)Amazing! You could almost pass for a gentlemen.  CUT TO THE RECEPTION ROOM ON D DECK, as the party descends to dinner. Theyencounter Molly Brown, looking good in a beaded dress, in her own bustybroad-shouldered way. Molly grins when she sees Jack. As they are goinginto the dining saloon she walks next to him, speaking low: Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack? Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up. Remember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've gota lot of it and you're in the club.As they enter the swirling throng, Rose leans close to him, pointing outseveral notables. There's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest manon the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicatecondition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal.                         (nodding toward a couple)And over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designsnaughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals.Cal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff-Gordon and ColonelGracie, while Ruth, the Countess and Lucille discuss fashion. Rose picotsJack smoothly, to show him another couple, dressed impeccably. And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs.Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course.Cal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male counterparts, who arelooking at Rose like a prize show horse. Hockley, she is splendid. Thank you. Cal's a lucky man. I know him well, and it can only be luck.Ruth steps over, hearing the last. She takes Cal's arm, somewhatcoquettishly. How can you say that Colonel? Caledon Hockley is a great catch.The entourage strolls toward the dining saloon, where they run into theAstor's going through the ornate double doors. J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.                             (shaking his hand)Good to meet you Jack. Are you of the Boston Dawsons? No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.J.J. nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled. Madeleine Astorappraises Jack and whispers girlishly to Rose: It's a pity we're both spoken for, isn't it?  Like a ballroom at the palace, alive and lit by a constellation ofchandeliers, full of elegantly dressed people and beautiful music fromBANDLEADER WALLACE HARTLEY'S small orchestra. As Rose and Jack enter andmove across the room to their table, Cal and Ruth beside them, we hear... He must have been nervous but he never faltered. They assumed he was one ofthem... a young captain of industry perhaps... new money, obviously, butstill a memeber of the club. Mother of course, could always be countedupon...    Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quitegood on this ship.WIDER: THE TABLE. Jack is seated opposite Rose, who is flanked by Cal andThomas Andrews. Also at the table are Molly Brown, Ismay, Colonel Gracie,the Countess, Guggenheim, Madame Aubert, and the Astors. The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats.Rose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off his plate. Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to myfiancee last night.                        (to Jack, as if to a child)This is foie gras. It's goose liver.We see whispers exchanged. Jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances. Nowthey're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous.                           (low to Madame Aubert)What is Hockly hoping to prove, bringing this... bohemian... up here?                                  (to Jack)How do you take your caviar, sir?                             (answering for him)Just a soupcon of lemon...                            (to Jack, smiling)...it improves the flavor with champagne.                               (to the waiter)No caviar for me, thanks.                                 (to Cal)Never did like it much.He looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles. And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson? Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God'sgood humor.Salad is served. Jack reaches for the fish fork. Rose gives him a look andpicks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes. He changes forks. You find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you? Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My fatherwas always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he wasborn in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you neverknow what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a firewhen I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like thatteaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count.Molly Brown raises her glass in a salute. Well said, Jack.                             (raising his glass)Here, here.Rose raises her glass, looking at Jack. To making it count.Ruth, annoyed that Jack has scored a point, presses him further. How is it you have the means to travel, Mr. Dawson? I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticketon Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker.                           (he glances at Rose)A very lucky hand. All life is a game of luck. A real man makes his own luck, Archie.Rose notices that Thomas Andrews, sitting next to her, is writing in hisnotebook, completely ignoring the conversation. Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in thislittle book.                           (grabs it and reads)Increase number of screws in hat hooks from 2 to 3. You build the biggestship in the world and this preoccupies you?!Andrews smiles sheepishly. He knows every rivet in her, don't you Thomas? All three million of them. His blood and soul are in the ship. She may be mine on paper, but in theeyes of God she belongs to Thomas Andrews. Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly. Thankyou, Rose.We see that Andrews has come under Rose's spell.83 TIME TRANSITION: Dessert has been served and a waiter arrives withcigars in a humidor on a wheeled cart. The men start clipping ends andlighting.                               (low, to Jack)Nest it'll be brandies in the Smoking Room.                                  (rising)Well, join me for a brandy, gentlemen?                                    (low)Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on beingmasters of the universe. Joining us, Dawson? You don't want to stay out here with the women, do you?Actually he does, but... No thanks. I'm heading back. Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing.Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.Cal and te other gentlemen exit. Jack, must you go? Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.He leans over to take her hand.INSERT: We see him slip a tiny folded not into her palm.Ruth, scowling, watches him walk away across the enormous room. Rosesurreptitiously opens the note below table level. It reads: ""Make it count.Meet me at the clock"".  Rose crosses the A-Deck foyer, sighting Jack at the landing above. Overheadis the crystal dome. Jack has his back to her, studying the ornate clockwith its carved figures of Honor and Glory. It softly strikes the hour.MOVING WITH ROSE as she goes up the sweeping staircase toward him. Heturns, sees her... smiles. Want to go to a real party?  Crow led and alive with music, laughter and raucous carrying on. An ad hocband is gathered near the upright piano, honking out lively stomping musicon fiddle, accoridon and tambourine. People of all ages are dancing,drinking beer and wine, smoking, laughing, even brawling.Tommy hands Rose a pint of stout and she hoists it. Jack meanwhile danceswith 5 year old Cora Cartmell, or tries to, with her standing on his feet.As the tune ends, Rose leans down to the little girl. May I cut in, miss? You're still my best girl, Cora.Cora scampers off. Rose and Jack face each other. She is trembling as hetakes her right hand in his left. His other hand slides to the small of herback. It is an electrifying moment. I don't know the steps. Just move with me. Don't think.The music starts and they are off. A little awkward at first, she starts toget into it. She grins at Jack as she starts to get the rhythm of thesteops. Wait... stop!She bends down, pulling off her high heeled shoes, and flings them toTommy. Then she grabs Jack and they plunge back into the fray, dancingfaster as the music speeds up.   The scene is rowdy and rollicking. A table gets knocked over as a drunkcrashes into it. And in the middle of it... Rose dancing with Jack in herstocking feet. The steps are fast and she shines with sweat. A space opensaround them, and people watch them, clapping as the band plays faster andfaster.FABRIZIO AND HELGA. Dancing has obviated the need for a common language. Hewhirls her, then she responds by whirling him... Fabrizio's eyes go widewhen he realizes she's stronger than he is.The tune ends in a mad rush. Jack steps away from Rose with a flourish,allowing her to take a bow. Exhilarated and slightly tipsy, she does agraceful ballet ployer, feet turned out perfectly. Everyone laughs andapplauds. Rose is a hit with the steerage folks, who've never had a ladyparty with them.They move to a table, flushed and sweaty. Rose grabs Fabrizio's cigaretteand takes a big drag. She's feeling cocky. Fabrizio is grinning, holdinghands with Helga. How you two doin'? I don't know hwat she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get alongfine.Tommy walks up with a pint for each of them. Rose chugs hers, showing off. You think a first class girl can't drink?Everybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes into Tommy,who sloshes his beer over Rose's dress. She laughs, not caring. But Tommylunges, grabbing Bjorn and wheeling him around. You stupid bastard!!Bjorn comes around, his fists coming up... and Jack leaps into the middleof it, pushing them apart. Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishmangoin' to the whorehouse?Tommy stands there, all piss and vinegar, chest puffed up. Then he grinsand claps Bjorn on the shoulder. So, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this.In her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, and goes upon point, taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes. The guys gapeat her incredible muscle control. She comes back down, then her face screwsup in pain. She grabs one foot, hopping around. Oooowww! I haven't done that in years.Jack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks up.THE DOOR to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy watches throughthe gap. He sees Jack holding Rose, both of them laughing.LOVEJOY closes the door.  The stars blaze overhead, so bright and clear you can see the Milky Way.Rose and Jack walk along the row of lifeboats. Still giddy from the party,they are singing a popular song ""Come Josephine in My Flying Machine"". Come Josephine in my flying machineAnd it's up she goes! Up she goes!In the air she goes. Where? There she goes!They fumble the words and break down laughing. They have reached the FirstClass Entrance, but don't go straight in, not wanting the evening to end.Through the doors the sound of the ship's orchestra wafts gently. Rosegrabs a davit and leans back, staring at the cosmos. Isn't it magnificent? So grand and endless.She goes to the rail and leans on it. They're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants onthe earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside thislittle tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst.He leans at the rail next to her, his hand just touching hers. It is theslightest contact imaginable, and all either one of them can feel is thatsquare inch of skin where their hands are touching. You're not one of them. There's been a mistake. A mistake? Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.                                 (laughing)I did, didn't I?                              (pointing suddenly)Look! A shooting star. That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, itwas a soul going to heaven. I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?Jack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very close together. Itwould be so easy to move another couple of inches, to kiss her. Rose seemsto be thinking the same thing. What would you wish for?After a beat, Rose pulls back. Something I can't have.                            (she smiles sadly)Goodnight, Jack. And thank you.She leaves the rail and hurries through the First Class Entrance. Rose!!But the door bangs shut, and she is gone. Back to her world.  SUNDAY APRIL 14, 1912. A bright clear day. Sunlight splashing across thepromenade. Rose and Cal are having breakfast in silence. The tension ispalpable. Trudy Bolt, in her maid's uniform, pours the coffee and goesinside. I had hoped you would come to me last night. I was tired. Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.                                (stiffening)I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. You will never behave like that again! Do you understand? I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am yourfiancee--Cal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash. Hemoves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping thesides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms. Yes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you willhonor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be madeout a fool! Is this in any way unclear?Rose shrinks into the chair. She sees Trudy, frozen, partway through thedoor bringing the orange juice. Cal follows Rose's glance and straightensup. He stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom. We... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy.  Rose is dressed for the day, and is in the middle of helping Ruth with hercorset. The tight bindings do not inhibit Ruth's fury at all. You are not to see that boy again, do you understand me Rose? I forbid it!Rose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is pulling thecorset strings with both hands. Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed.Ruth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it. CLACK!                              (wheeling on her)Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money'sgone! Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day! Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a goodname. And that name is the only card we have to play.Rose turns her around and grabs the corset strings again. Ruth sucks in herwaist and Rose pulls. I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insureour survival.                               (hurt and lost)How can you put this on my shoulders?Rose turns to her, and we see what Rose sees-- the naked fear in hermother's eyes. Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do youwant to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered tothe winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish? It's so unfair. Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.Rose pulls the corset tighter.  At the divine service, Captain Smith is leading a group in the hymn""Almighty Father Strong To Save."" Rose and Ruth sing in the middle of thegroup.Lovejoy stands well back, keeping an eye on Rose. He notices a commotion atthe entry doors. Jack has been halted there by two stewards. He is dressedin his third class clothes, and stands there, hat in hand, looking out ofplace. Look, you, you're not supposed to be in here. I was just here last night... don't you remember?                    (seeing Lovejoy coming toward him)He'll tell you. Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater continue to be most appreciative ofyour assistance. They asked me to give you this in gratitude--He holds out two twenty dollar bills, which Jack refuses to take. I don't want money, I-- --and also to remind you that you hold a third class ticket and yourpresence here is no longer appropriate.Jack spots Rose but she doesn't see him. I just need to talk to Rose for a-- Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson gets back where he belongs.                   (giving the twenties to the stewards)And that he stays there. Yes sir!                                 (to Jack)Come along you.END ON ROSE, not seeing Jack hustled out.                                  (singing)O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea.  An Edwardian nautilus room. There are machines we recognize, and somedon't. A woman pedals a stationary bicycle in a long dress, lookingrediculous. Thomas Andrews is leading a small tour group, including Rose,Ruth and Cal. Cal is wroking the oars of a stationary rowing machine with awell trained stroke. Reminds me of my Harvard days.T.W. McCAULEY, the gym instructor, is a bouncy little man in whiteflannels, eager to show off his modern equipment, like his present-daycounterpart on an ""Abflex"" infomercial. He hits a switch and a machine witha saddle on it starts to undulate. Rose puts her hand on it, curious. The electric horse is very popular. We even have an electric camel.                                 (to Ruth)Care to try your hand at the rowing, m'am? Don't be absurd. I can't think of a skill I should likely need less. The next stop on our tour will be bridge. This way, please.  Jack, walking with determination, is followed closely by Tommy andFabrizio. He quickly climbs the steps to B-Deck and steps over the gateseparating 3rd from 2nd class. She's a goddess amongst mortal men, there's no denyin'. But she's inanother world, Jackie, forget her. She's closed the door.Jack moves furtively to the wall below the A-Deck promenade, aft. It was them, not her.                        (glancing around the deck)Ready... go.Tommy shakes his head resignedly and puts his hands together, crouchingdown. Jack steps into Tommy's hands and gets boosted up to the next deck,where he scrambles nimbly over the railing, onto the First Class deck. He's not bein' logical, I tell ya. Amore is'a not logical.  A man is playing with his son, who is spinning a top with a string. Theman's overcoat and hat are sitting on a deck chair nearby. Jack emergesfrom behind one of the huge deck cranes and calmly picks up the coat andbowler hat. He walks away, slipping into the coat, and slicks his hair backwith spit. Then puts the hat on at a jaunty angle. At a distance he couldpass for a gentlemen.  HAROLD BRIDE, the 21 year old Junior Wireless Operator, hustles in andskirts around Andrews' tour group to hand a Marconigram to Captain Smith. Another ice warning, sir. This one from the ""Baltic"". Thankyou, Sparks.Smith glances at the message then nonchalantly puts it in his pocket. Henods reassuringly to Rose and the group. Not to worry, it's quite normal for this time of year. In fact, we'respeeding up. I've just ordered the last boilers lit.Andrews scowls slightly before motioning the group toward the door. Theyexit just as SECOND OFFICER CHARLES HERBERT LIGHTOLLER comes out of thechartroom, stopping next to First Officer Murdoch. Did we ever find those binoculars for the lookouts? Haven't seen them since Southampton.  Andrews leads the group back from the bridge along the boat deck. Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboatstimes the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there arenot enough for everyone aboard. About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put inthese new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.                        (he gestures along the eck)But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. SoI was over-ruled.                        (slapping the side of a boat)Waste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable ship! Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship, strong and true.She's all the lifeboat you need.As they are passing Boat 7, a gentlemen turns from the rail and walks upbehind the group. It is Jack. He taps Rose on the arm and she turns,gasping. He motions and she cuts away from the group toward a door whichJack holds open. They duck into the--  Jack closes the door behind her, and glances out through the ripple-glasswindow to the starboard rail, where the gym instructor is chatting up thewoman who was riding the bike. Rose and Jack are alone in the room. Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.He takes her by the shoulders. Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under thatyou're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girlI've ever known and-- Jack, I-- No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I havenothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, Ijump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to bealright.Rose feels the tears coming to her eyes. Jack is so open and real... notlike anyone she has ever known. You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really. I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, andyou're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'causeyou're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out. It's not up to you to save me, Jack. You're right. Only you can do that. I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes,leave me alone.  The most elegant room on the ship, done in Louis Quinze Versaille style.Rose sits on a divan, with a group of other women arrayed around her. Ruth,the Countess Rothes and Lady Duff-Gordon are taking tea. Rose is silent andstill as a porcelain figurine as the conversation washes around her. Of course the invitations had to be sent back to the printers twice. Andthe bridesmaids dresses! Let me tell you what an odyssey that has been...TRACKING SLOWLY IN on Rose as Ruth goes on.REVERSE, ROSE'S POV: A tabeau of MOTHER and DAUGHTER having tea. The fouryear old girl, wearing white gloves, daintily picking up a cookie. Themother correcting her on her posture, and the way she holds the teacup. Thelittle girl is trying so hard to please, her expression serious. A glimpseof Rose at that age, and we see the relentless conditioning... the pain tobecoming an Edwardian geisha.ON ROSE. She calmly and deliberately turns her teacup over, spilling teaall over her dress. Oh, look what I've done.  TITANIC STEAMS TOWARD US, in the dusk light, as if lit by the embers of agiant fire. As the ship looms, FILLING FRAME, we push in on the bow. Jackis there, right at the apex of the bow railing, his favorite spot. Hecloses his eyes, letting the chill wind clear his head.Jack hears her voice, behind him... Hello, Jack.He turns and she is standing there. I changed my mind.He smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in. Her cheeks are red with thechill wind, and her eyes sparkle. Her hair blows wildly about her face. Fabrizio said you might be up-- Sssshh. Come here.He puts his hands on her waist. As if he is going to kiss her. Close your eyes.She does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going. Hepresses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her. Then he takesher two hands and raises them until she is standing with her armsoutstetched on each side. Rose is going along with him. When he lowers hishands, her arms stay up... like wings. Okay. Open them.Rose gasps. There is nothing in her field of vision but water. It's likethere is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring. TheAtlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky.There is only the wind, and the hiss of the water 50 feel below. I'm flying!She leans forward, arching her back. He puts his hands on her waist tosteady her.                              (singing softly)Come Josephine in my flying machine...Rose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above thesea. She smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back againsthis chest. He pushes forward slightly against her.Slowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers...fingertips gently touching. Then their fingers intertwine. Moving slowly,their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of twolovers.Jack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of herwash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear.Rose turns her head until her lips are near his. She lowers her arms,turning further, until she finds his mouth with hers. He wraps his armsaround her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned andtilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. Theykiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion.Jack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism,lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward intoa night without fear.100 IN THE CROW'S NEST, high above and behind them, lookout FREDERICK FLEETnudges his mate, REGINALD LEE, pointing down at the figures in the bow. Wish I had those bleedin' binoculars.101 JACK AND ROSE, embracing at the bow rail, DISSOLVE SLOWLY AWAY, leavingthe ruined bow of the WRECK--  OLD ROSE blinks, seeming to come back to the present. She sees the wreck onthe screen, the sad ghost ship deep in the abyss. That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.Brock Lovett changes the tape in the minicassette recorder. So we're up to dusk on the night of the sinking. Six hours to go. Don't you love it? There's Smith, he's standing there with the icebergwarning in his fucking hand...                            (remembering Rose)... excuse me... in his hand, and he's ordering more speed. 26 years of experience working against him. He figures anything big enoughto sink the ship they're going to see in time to turn. But the ship's toobig, with too small a rudder... it can't corner worth shit. Everything heknows is wrong.ROSE is ignoring this conversation. She has the art-nouveau comb with thejade butterfly on the handle in her hands, turning it slowly. She iswatching a monitor, which shows the ruins of Suite B-52/56. PUSH IN untilthe image fills frame.  ... 1912. Like in a dream the beautiful woodwork and satin upholsteryemerge from the rusted ruin. Jack is overwhelmed by the opulence of theroom. He sets his sketchbood and drawing materials on the marble table. Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?                             (bad French accent)Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.                          (seeing the paintings)Hey... Monet!He crouches next to the paintings stacked against the wall. Isn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole inthis garden fence in Giverny.She goes into the adjoining walk-in wardrobe closet. He sees her go to thesafe and start working the combination. He's fascinated. Cal insist on luggin this thing everywhere. Should I be expecting him anytime soon? Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.CLUNK! She unlocks the safe. Glancing up, she meets his eyes in the mirrorbehind the safe. She opens it and removes the necklace, then holds it outto Jack who takes it nervously. What is it? A sapphire? A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.Jack gazes at wealth beyond his comprehension. I want you to draw me like your French girl. Wearing this.                            (she smiles at him)Wearing only this.He looks up at her, surprised, and we CUT TO:104 ROSE'S BEDROOM. ON THE BUTTERFLY COMB as Rose draws it out of her hair.She shakes her head and her hair falls free around her shoulders.105 IN THE SITTING ROOM Jack is laying out his pencils like surgical tools.His sketchbook is open and ready. He looks up as she comes into the room,wearing a silk kimono. The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a china doll.As a paying customer, I expect to get what I want.She hands him a dime and steps back, parting the kimono. The blue stonelies on her creamy breast. Her heart is pounding as she slowly lowers therobe.Jakc looks so stricken, it is almost comical. The kimono drops to the floor(this is all in cuts, lyrical). Tell me when it looks right to you.She poses on the divan, settling like a cat into the position we rememberfrom the drawing... almost. Uh... just bend your left leg a little and... and lower your head. Eyes tome. That's it.Jack starts to sketch. He drops his pencil and she stifles a laugh. I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monetblushing.                                 (sweating)He does landscapes.TIGHT ON JACK as his eyes come up to look at her over the top edge of hissketchpad. We have seen this image of him before, in her memory. It is animage she will carry the rest of her life.Despite his nervousness, he draws with sure strokes, and what emerges isthe best thing he has ever done. Her pose is languid, her hands beautiful,and her eyes radiate her energy.   MATCH DISSOLVE/MORPH to Rose, 101 years old. Only her eyes are the same. My heart was pounding the whole time. It was the most erotic moment of mylife... up till then at least.CUT TO REVERSE: A semicircle of listeners staring in rapt, frozen silence.The story of Jack and Rose has finally and completely grabbed them. What, uh... happened next?                                  (smiling)You mean, did we ""do it""?  BACK TO 1912. Jack is signing the drawing. Rose, wearing her kimono again,is leaning on his shoulder, watching. Sorry to disappoint you Mr. Bodine.Rose gazes at the drawing. He has X-rayed her soul. Date it, Jack. I want to always remember this night.He does: 4/14/1912. Rose meanwhile scribbles a note on a piece of Titanicstationary. We don't see what it says. She accepts the drawing from him,and crosses to the safe in the wardrobe.She puts the diamond back in the safe, placing hte drawing and the note ontop of it. Closes the door with a CLUNK!  Lovejoy enters from the Palm Court through the revolving door and crossesthe room toward Hockley. A fire is blazing in the marble fireplace, and theusual fatcats are playing cards, drinking and talking. Cal sees Lovejoy anddetaches from his group, coming to him. None of the stewards have seen her.                             (low but forceful)This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.  TITANIC glides across an unnatural sea, blakc and calm as a pool of oil.The ships lights are mirrored almost perfectly in the black water. The skyis brilliant with stars. A meteor traces a bright line across the heavens.110 ON THE BRIDGE, Captain Smith peers out at the blackness ahead of theship. QUARTERMASTER HITCHINS brings him a cup of hot tea with lemon. Itsteams in the bitter cold of the open bridge. Second Officer Lightoller isnext to him, staring out at the sheet of black glass the Atlantic hasbecome. I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea. Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind. It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base. Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller. Yes sir. And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degreedoubtful.  Rose, fully dressed now, returns to the sitting room. They hear a key inthe lock. Rose takes Jack's hand and leads him silently through thebedrooms. Lovejoy enters by the sitting room door. Miss Rose? Hello?He hears a door opening and goes through Cal's room toward hers.  Rose and Jack come out of her stateroom, closing the door. She leads himquickly along the corridor toward the B deck foyer. They are halfway acrossthe open space when the sitting room door opens in the corridor and Lovejoycomes out. The valet sees Jack with Rose and hustles after them. Come on!She and Jack break into a run, surprising the few ladies and gentlemenabout. Rose leads him past the stairs to the bank of elevators. They runinto one, shocking the hell out of the OPERATOR. Take us down. Quickly, quickly!The Operator scrambles to comply. Jack even helps him close the steel gate.Lovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend. He slams one hand on thebars of the gate. Rose makes a very rude and unladylike gesture, and laughsas Lovejoy disappears above. The Operator gapes at her.  Lovejoy emerges from another lift and runs to the one Jack and Rose werein. The Operator is just closing the gate to go back up. Lovejoy runsaround the bank of elevators and scans the foyer... no Jack and Rose. Hetries the stairs going down to F-Deck.  A functional space, with access to a number of machine spaces (fan rooms,boiler uptakes). Jack and Rose are leaning against a wall, laughing. Pretty tough for a valet, this fella. He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble...to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch,after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town... Kinda like we're doin' right now-- uh oh!Lovejoy has spotted them from a cross-corridor nearby. He charges towardthem. Jack and Rose run around a corner into a blind alley. There is onedoor, marked CREW ONLY, and Jack flings it open.115 They enter a roaring RAN ROOM, with no way out but a ladder going down.Jack latches the deadbolt on the door, and Lovejoy slams against it amoment later. Jack grins at Rose, pointing to the ladder. After you, m'lady.  Jack and Rose come down the escape ladder and look around in amazement. Itis like a vision of hell itself, with the roaring furnaces and blackfigures moving in the smoky glow. They run the length of the boiler room,dodging amazed stokers, and trimmers with their wheelbarrows of coal.                           (shouting over the din)Carry on! Don't mind us!They run through the open watertight door into BOILER ROOM SIX. Jack pullsher through the fiercely hot alley between two boilers and they wind up inthe dark, out of sight of the working crew. Watching from the shadows, theysee the stokers working in the hellish glow, shovelling coal into theinsatiable maws of the furnaces. The whole place thunders with the roar ofthe fires.  Amid unparalled luxury, Cal sits at a card game, sipping brandy. We're going like hell I tel you. I have fifty dollars that says we make itinto New York Tuesday night!Cal looks at his gold pocket watch, and scowls, not listening.   The furnaces roar, silhouetting the glistening stokers. Jack kisses Rose'sface, tasting the sweat trickling down from her forehead. They kisspassionately in the steamy, pounding darkness.  Jack and Rose enter and run laughing between the rows of stacked cargo. Shehugs herself against the cold, after the dripping heat of the boiler room.They come upon William Carter's brand new RENAULT touring car, lashing downto a pallet. It looks like a royal coach from a fairy tale, its brass trimand headlamps nicely set off by its deep burgundy color.Rose climbs into the plushly upholstered back seat, acting very royal.There are cut crystals bud vases on the walls back there, each containing arose. Jack jumps into the driver's seat, enjoying hte feel of the leatherand wood. Where to, Miss? To the stars.ON JACK as her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the seatinto the back. He lands next to her, and his breath seems loud in the quietdarkness. He looks at her and she is smiling. It is the moment of truth. Are you nervous? Au contraire, mon cher.He strokes her face, cherishing her. She kisses his artist's fingers. Put your hands on me Jack.He kisses her, and she slides down in the seat under his welcome weight.  A BRILLIANT ARC OF ELECTRICITY fills frame-- the sparks gap of the Marconiinstrument as SENIOR WIRELESS OPERATOR JACK PHILLIPS (24) rapidly keys outa message. Junior Operator Bride looks through the huge stack of outgoingmessages swamping them. Look at this one, he wants his private train to meet him. La dee da.                             (slaps them down)We'll be up all bloody night on this lot.Phillips start to receive an incoming message from a nearby ship, theLeyland frieghter CALIFORNIAN, which jams his outgoing signal. At suchclose range, the beeps are deafening. Christ! It's that idiot on the Californian.Cursing, Phillips furiously keys a rebuke.  Wireless Operater CYRIL EVANS pulls his earphone off his ear as theTitanic's spark deafens him. he translates the message for THIRD OFFICER  Stupid bastard. I try to warn him about the ice, and he says ""Keep out.Shut up. I'm working Cape Race."" Now what's he sending? ""No seasickness. Poker business good. Al"". Well that's it for me. I'mshutting down.As Evans wearily switches off his generator, Groves goes out on deck. PANoFF Him to reveal the ship is stopped fifty yards from the edge of a fieldof pack ice and icebergs stretching as far as the eye can see.  ON TITANIC, steaming hellbent through the darkness, hurling up white waterat the bows. The bow comes straight at us, until the bow wave WIPES THE   PUSHING IN on the rear window of the Renault, which is completely foggedup. Rose's hand comes up and slams against the glass for a moment, making ahandprint in the veil of condensation.INSIDE THE CAR, Jack's overcoat is liek a blanket over them. It stirs andRose pulls it down. They are huddled under it, intertwined, still mostlyclothed. Their faces are flushed and they look at each other wonderingly.She puts her hand on his face, as if making sure he is real. You're trembling. It's okay. I'm alright.He lays his cheek against her chest. I can feel your heart beating.She hugs his head to her chest, and just holds on for dear life. Well, I wasn't the first teenage girl to get seduced in the backseat of acar, and certainly not the last, by several million. He had such finehands, artists' hands, but strong too... roughened by work. I remembertheir touch even now.  The bow sweeps under us, and the CAMERA CLIMBS toward the foremast and thetiny half-cylinder of the crow's nest, which grows as we push in onlookouts Fleet and Lee. They are stamping their feet and swinging theirarms, trying to keep warm in the 22 knot freezing wind, which whips caporof their breath away behind. You can smell ice, you know, when it's near. Bollocks. Well I can.  Without hearing hte words over the roar of the furnaces, we see stokerstelling TWO STEWARDS which way Rose and Jack went. The stewards move offtoward the forward holds.  Cal stands at the open safe. He stares at the drawing of Rose and his faceclenches with fury. He reads the not again: ""DARLING, NOW YOU CAN KEEP US Lovejoy, standing behind him, looks over his shoulder at the drawing. Calcrumples Rose's not, then takes the drawing in both hands as if to rip itin half. He tenses to do it, then stops himself. I have a better idea.  The two stewards enter. They have electric torches and play the beamsaround the hold. They spot the Renault with its fogged up rear window andapproach it slowly.FROM INSIDE we see the torch light up Rose's passionate handprint, stillthere on the fogged up glass. One steward whips open the door. Got yer!REVERSE: the back seat is empty.  Rose and Jack, fully dressed, come through a crew door onto the deck. Theycan barely stand, they are laughing so hard.UP ABOVE THEM, IN THE CROW'S NEST, lookout Fleet hears the disturbancebelow and looks around and back down to the well deck, where he can see twofigures embracing.Jack and Rose stand in each others arms. Their breath clouds around them inthe now freezing air, but they don't even feel the cold. When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you. This is crazy. I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.Jack pulls her to him and kisses her fiercely.130 IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet nudges Lee. Cor... look at that, would ya. They're a bloody sight warmer than we are. Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, ifit's all the same.They both have a good laugh at that one. It is Fleet whose expression fallsfirst. Glancing forward again, he does a double take. The color drains outof his face.FLEET'S POV: a massive iceberg right in their path, 500 yards out. Bugger me!!Fleet reaches past Lee and rings the lookout bell three times, then grabsthe telephone, calling the bridge. He waits precious seconds for it to bepicket up, never taking his eyes off the black mass ahead. Pick up, ya bastard.  Inside the enclosed wheelhous, SIXTH OFFICER MOODY walks unhurriedly to thetelephone, picking it up. Is someone there? Yes. What do you see? Iceberg right ahead! Thankyou.                       (hangs up, calls to Murdoch)Iceberg right ahead!Murdoch sees it and rushes to the engine room telegraph. While signaling""FULL SPEED ASTERN"" he yells to Quartermaster Hitchins, who is at thewheel. Hard a' starboard.                         (standing behind Hitchins)Hard'a starboard. The helm is hard over, sir. 132 CHIEF ENGINEER BELL is just checking the soup he has warming on a steammanifold when the engine telegraph clangs, then goes... incredibly... toFULL SPEED ASTERN. He and the other ENGINEERS just stare at it a second,unbelieving. Then Bell reacts. Full astern! FULL ASTERN!!The engineers and greasers like madmen to close steam valves and startbraking the mighty propeller shafts, big as Sequias, to a stop.133 IN BOILER ROOM SIX, Leading Stoker FREDERICK BARRETT is standing with2nd Engineer JAMES HESKETH when the red warning light and ""STOP"" indicatorcome on. Shut all dampers! Shut 'em!!134 FROM THE BRIDGE Murdoch watches the burg growing... straight ahead. Thebow finally starts to come left (since the ship turns the reverse of thehelm setting).MURDOCH'S jaw clenches as the bow turns with agonizing slowness. He holdshis breath as the horrible physics play out.135 IN THE CROW'S NEST Frederick Fleet braces himself.136 THE BOW OF THE SHIP thunders right at CAMERA and--KRUUUNCH!! The ship hits the berg on its starboard bow.137 UNDERWATER we see the ice smashing in the steel hull plates. Theiceberg bumps and scrapes along the side of the ship. Rivets pop as thesteel plate of the hull flexes under the load.138 IN #2 HOLD the two stewards stagger as the hull buckles in four feetwith a sound like THUNDER. Like a sledgehammer beating along outside theship, the berg splits the hull plates and the sea pour in, sweeping themoff their feert. The icy water swirls around the Renault as the menscramble for the stairs.139 ON G-DECK forward Fabrizio is tossed in his bunk by the impact. Hehears a sound like the greatly amplified squeal of a skate on ice.140 IN BOILER ROOM SIX Barret and Hesketh stagger as they hear the ROLLINGTHUNDER of the collision. They see the starboard side of the ship buckle intoward them and are almost swept off their feet by a rush of water comingin about two feet above the floor.141 ON THE FORWARD WELL DECK Jack and Rose break their kiss and look up inastonishment as the berg sails past, blocking out the sky like a mountain.Fragments break off it and crash down onto the deck, and they have to jumpback to avoid flying chunks of ice.142 ON THE BRIDGE Murdoch rings the watertight door alarm. He quicky throwsthe switch that closes them. Hard a 'port!Judging the berg to be amidships, he is trying to clear the stern.143 BARRETT AND HESKETH hear the DOOR ALARM and scramble through theswirling water to the watertight door between Boiler Rooms 6 and 5. Theroom is full of water vapor as the cold sea strikes the red hot furnaces.Barrett yells to the stokers scrambling through the door as it comes downlike a slow guillotine. Go Lads! Go! Go!He dives through into Boiler Room 5 just before the door rumbles down witha CLANG.144 JACK AND ROSE rush to the starboard rail in time to see the berg movingaft down the side of the ship.145 In his stateroom, surrounded by piles of plans while making notes inhis ever-present book, Andrews looks up at the sound of a cut-crystal lightfixture tinkling like a windchime.He feels the shudder run through the ship. And we see it in his face. Toomuch of his soul is in this great ship for him not to feel its mortalwound.146 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Gracie watches his highball vibratingon the table.147 IN THE PALM COURT, with its high arched windows, Molly Brown holds upher drink to a passing waiter. Hey, can I get some ice here, please?Silently, a moving wall of ice fills the window behind her. She doesn't seeit. It disappears astern. 149 IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet turns to his Lee... Oy, mate... that was a close shave. Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!  CLOSE ON MURDOCH. The alarm bells still clatter mindlessly, seeming toreflect his inner state. He is in shock, unable to get a grip on what justhappened. He just ran the biggest ship in history into an iceberg on itsmaiden voyage.                             (stiffly, to Moody)Note the time. Enter it in the log.Captain Smith rushes out of his cabin onto the bridge, tucking in hisshirt. What was that, Mr. Murdoch? An iceberg, sir. I put her hard a' starboard and run the engines fullastern, but it was too close. I tried to port around it, but she hi... and  Close the emergency doors. The doors are closed.Together they rush out onto the starboard wing, and Murdoch points. Smithlooks into the darkness aft, then wheels around to FOURTH OFFICER BOHALL. Find the Carpenter and get him to sound the ship.  In steerage, Fabrizio comes out into the hall to see what's going on. Hesees dozens of rats running toward him in the corridor, fleeing theflooding bow. Fabrizio jumps aside as the rats run by. Ma-- che cazzo!152 IN HIS STATEROOM Tommy gets out of his top bunk in the dark and dropsdown to the floor. SPLASH!! Cor!! What in hell--?!He naps on the light. The floor is covered with 3 inches of freezing water,and more coming in. He pulls the door open, and steps out into thecorridor, which is flooded. Fabrizio is running toward him, yellingsomething in Italian. Tommy and Fabrizio start pounding on doors, gettingeverybody up and out. The alarm spreads in several languages.  A couple of people have come out into the corridor in robes and slippers. ASTeWARD hurries along, reassuring them. Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder? I shouldn't worry, m'am. We've likely thrown a propeller blade, that's theshudder you felt. May I bring you anything?THOMAS ANDREWS brushes past them, walking fast and carrying an armload ofrolled up ship's plans.  Jack and Rose are leaning over the starboard rail, looking at the hull ofthe ship. Looks okay. I don't see anything. Could it have damaged the ship? It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.Behind them a couple of steerage guys are kicking the ice around the deck,laughing.  Fabrizio and Tommy are in a crowd of steerage men clogging the corridors,heading aft away from the flooding. Many of them have grabbed suitcases andduffel bags, some of which are soaked. If this is the direction the rats were runnin', it's good enough for me.  Bruce Ismay, dressed in pajamas under the topcoat, hurries down thecorridor, headed for the bridge. An officious steward named BARNES comesalong the other direction, getting the few concerned passengers back intotheir rooms. There's no cause for alarm. Please, go back to your rooms.He is stopped in his tracks by Cal and Lovejoy. Please, sir. There's no emergency-- Yes there is, I have been robbed. Now get the Master at Arms. Now youmoron!  C.U. CAPTAIN SMITH studying the commutator.He turns to Andrews, standing behind him. A five degree list in less than ten minutes.SHIP'S CARPENTER JOHN HUTCHINSON enters behind him, out of breath andclearly unnerved. She's making water fast... in the forepeak tank and the forward holds, inboiler room six.ISMAY enters, his movements quick with anger and frustration. Smith glancesat him with annoyance. Why have we stopped? We've struck ice. Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?                                  (glaring)Excuse me.Smith pushes past him, with Andrews and Hutchinson in tow.  Strokers and firemen are struggling to draw the fires. They are working inwaist deep water churning around as it flows into the boiler room, ice coldand swirling with grease from the machinery. Chief Engineer Bell comespartway down the ladder and shouts. That's it, lads. Get the hell up!They scramble up the escape ladders.  The gentlemen, now joined by another man, leans on the forward railwatching the steerage men playing soccer with chunks of ice. I guess it's nothing too serious. I'm going back to my cabin to read.A 20ish YALE MAN pops through the door wearing a topcoat over pajamas. Say, did I miss the fun?Rose and Jack come up the steps from the well deck, which are right next tothe three men. They stare as the couple climbs over the locked gate.A moment later Captain Smith rounds the corner, followed by Andrews andCarpenter Hutchinson. They have come down from the bridge by the outsidestairs. The three men, their faces grim, crush right past Jack and Rose.Andrews barely glances at her. Can you shore up? Not unless the pumps get ahead.The inspection party goes down the stairs to the well deck.                                (low, to her)It's bad. We have to tell Mother and Cal. Now it's worse. Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right? Right.Jack follows Rose through the door inside the ship.  Jack and Rose cross the foyer, entering the corridor. Lovejoy is waitingfor them in the hall as they approach the room. We've been looking for you miss.Lovejoy follows and, unseen, moves close behind Jack and smoothly slips thediamond necklace into the pocket of his overcoat.  Cal and Ruth wait in the sitting room, along with the Master at Arms andtwo stewards (Steward #1 and Barnes). Silence as Rose and Jack enter. Ruthcloses her robe at her throat when she sees Jack. Something serious has happened. That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now thatone is back...                       (he looks from Rose to Jack)... I have a pretty good idea where to fine the other.                            (to Master at Arms)Search him.The Master at Arms steps up to Jack. Coat off, mate.Lovejoy pulls at Jack's coat and Jack shakes his head in dismay, shruggingout of it. The Master at Arms pats him down. This is horseshit. Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you--Steward Barnes pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of the pocket of Jack'scoat. Is this it?Rose is stunned. Needless to say, so is Jack. That's it. Right then. Now don't make a fuss.He starts to handcuff Jack. Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!                                 (uncertain)He couldn't have. Of course he could. Easy enough for a professional. He memorized thecombination when you opend the safe.FLASHBACK: Rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting Jack's eyesas he stands behind her, watching. But I was with him the whole time.                         (just to her, low and cold)Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on. They put it in my pocket!                            (holding Jack's coat)It's not even your pocket, son.                                 (reading)""Property of A. L. Ryerson"".Lovejoy shows the coat to the Master at Arms. There is a label inside thecollar with the owner's name. That was reported stolen today. I was going to return it! Rose--Rose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. She shrinks away from him.He starts shouting to her as Lovejoy and the Master at Arms drag him outinto the hall. She can't look him in the eye. Rose, don't listen to them... I didn't do this! You know I didn't! You knowit!She is devastated. Her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as tetears well up. Why do women believe men?  Smith and Andrews come down the steps to the Mail Sorting Room and findsthe clerks scrambling to pull mail from the racks. They are furiouslyhauling wet sacks of mail up from the hold below.Andrews climbs partway down the stairs to the hold, which is almost full.Sacks of mail float everywhere. The lights are still on below the surface,casting an eerie glow. The Renault is visible under the water, the brassglinting cheerfully. Andrews looks down as the water covers his shoe, andscrambles back up the stairs.  Andrews unrolls a big drawing of the ship across the chartroom table. It isa side elevation, showing all the watertight bulkheads. His hands areshaking. Murdoch and Ismay hover behind Andrews and the Captain. When can we get underway, do you think?Smith glares at him and turns his attention to Andrews' drawing. Thebuilder points to it for emphasis as he talks. Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in allthree holds... and in boiler room six. That's right. Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartmentsbreached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the waterwill spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to thenext... back and back. There's no stopping it. The pumps-- The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matterwhat we do, Titanic will founder. But this ship can't sink! She is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will. It is amathematical certainty.Smith looks like he has been gutpunched. How much time? An hour, two at most.Ismay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare. And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch? Two thousand two hundred souls aboard, sir.A long beat. Smith turns to his employer. I believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.  Andrews is striding along the boat deck, as seamen and officers scurry touncover the boats. Steam is venting from pipes on the funnes overhead, andthe din is horrendous. Speech is difficult adding to the crew's level ofdisorganization. Andrews sees some men fumbling with the mechanism of oneof the Wellin davits and yells to them over the roar of steam. Turn to the right! Pull the falls taut before you unchock. Have you neverhad a boat drill? No sir! Not with these new davits, sir.He looks around, disguisted as the crew fumble with the davits, and thetackle for the ""falls""... the ropes which are used to lower the boats. Afew passengers are coming out on deck, hesitantly in the noise and bittercold.  From inside the sitting room they can hear knocking and voices in thecorridor. I had better go dress.Ruth exits and Hockley crosses to Rose. He regards her coldly for a moment,then SLAPS her across the face. It is a little slut, isn't it?To Rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has beengiven. Cal grabs her shoulders roughly. Look at me, you little--There is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice. The door opens andtheir steward puts his head in. Sir, I've been told to ask you to please put on your lifebelt, and come upto the boat deck. Get out. We're busy.The steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of adresser. I'm sorry about the inconvenience, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.Please dress warmly, it's quite cold tonight.                       (he hands a lifebelt to Rose)Not to worry, miss, I'm sure it's just a precaution. This is ridiculous.In the corridor outside the stewards are being so polite and obsequiousthey are conveying no sense of danger whatsoever. However, it's anotherstory in...  BLACKNESS. Then BANG! The door is thrown open and the lights snapped on bya steward. The Cartmell family rouses from a sound sleep. Everybody up. Let's go. Put your lifebelts on.IN THE CORRIDOR outside, another steward is going from door to door alongthe hall, pouncing and yelling. Lifebelts on. Lifebelts on. Everybody up, come on. Lifebelts on...People come out of the doors behind the steward, perplexed. In theforeground a SYRIAN WOMAN asks her husband what was said. He shrugs.  ON PHILLIPS, looking shocked. CQD, sir? That's right. The distress call. CQD. Tell whoever responds that we aregoing down by the head and need immediate assistance.Smith hurries out. Blimey. Maybe you ought to try that new distress call... S.O.S.                                (grinning)It may be our only chance to use it.Phillips laughs in spite of himself and starts sending history's firstS.O.S. Dit dit dit, da da da, dit dit dit... over and over.  Thomas Andrews looks around in amazement. The deck is empty except for thecrew fumbling with the davits. He yells over the roar of the steam to FirstOfficer Murdoch. Where are all the passengers? They've all gone back inside. Too damn cold and noisy for them.Andrews feels like he is in a bad dream. He looks at his pocketwatch andheads for the foyer entrance.  A large number of First Class passengers have gathered near the staircase.They are getting indignant about the confusion. Molly Brown snags a passing  What's doing, sonny? You've got us all trussed up and now we're cooling ourheels.The young steward backs away, actually stumbling on the stairs. Sorry, mum. Let me go and find out.The jumpy piano rhythm of ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" comes out of the firstclass lounge a few yards away. Band leader WALLACE HARTLEY has assembledsome of his men on Captain's orders, to allay panic.Hockley's entourage comes up to the A-deck foyer. Cal is carrying thelifebelts, almost as an afterthought. Rose is like a sleepwalker. It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book. There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.                                (to Trudy)Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when weget back.Thomas Andrews enters, looking around the magnificent room, which he knowsis doomed. Rose, standing nearby, sees his heartbroken expression. Shewalks over to him and Cal goes after her. I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell methe truth. The ship will sink. You're certain? Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. My God.Now it is Cal's turn to look stunned. The Titanic? Sinking? Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic.And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you aboutthe boats? Yes, I understand. Thankyou.Andrews goes off, moving among the passengers and urging them to put ontheir lifebelts and get to the boats.  Lovejoy and the Master at Arms are handcuffing Jack to a 4"" WATER PIPE as acrewman rushes in anxiously and almost blurts to the Master at Arms-- You're wanted by the Purser, sir. Urgently. Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.Lovejoy pulls a pearl handled Colt .45 automatic from under his coat. TheMaster at Arms nods and tosses the handcuff key to Lovejoy, then exits withthe crewman. Lovejoy flips the key in the air. Catches it.  Junior Wireless Operator Bride is relaying a message to Captain Smith fromthe CUNARD LINER CARPATHIA. Carpathia says they're making 17 knots, full steam for them, sir. And she's the only one who's responding? The only one close, sir. She says they can be here in four hours. Four hours!The enormity of it hits Smith like a sledgehammer blow. Thank you, Bride.He turns as Bride exits, and looks out onto the blackness.                                (to himself)My God.  Lightoller has his boats swung out. He is standing amidst a crowd ofuncertain passengers in all states of dress and undress. One first classwoman is barefoot. Others are in stockings. The maitre of the restaurant isin top hat and overcoat. Others are still in evening dress, while some arein bathrobes and kimonos. Women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns,then topping it with sble stoles. Some brought jewels, others books, evensmall dogs.Lightoller sees Smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly goes to him.He yells into the Captain's ear, through cupped hands, over the roar of thesteam... Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?Smith just nods, a bit abstractly. The fire has gone out of him. Lightollersees the awesome truth in Smith's face.                                (to the men)Right! Start the loading. Women and children!The appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off, leaving a suddenunearthly silence in which Lightoller's voice echoes.ON WALLACE HARTLEY raising his violin to play. Number 26. Ready and--The band has reassembled just outside the First Class Entrance, port side,near where Lightoller is calling for the boats to be loaded. They strike upa waltz, lively and elegant. The music wafts all over the ship. Ladies, please. Step into the boat.Finally one soman steps across the gap, into the boat, terrified of thedrop to the water far below. You watch. They'll put us off in these silly little boats to freeze, andwe'll all be back on board by breakfast.Cal, Rose and Ruth come out of the doors near the band. My brooch, I left my brooch. I must have it!She turns back to go to her room but Cal takes her by the arm, refusing tolet her go. The firmness of his hold surprises her. Stay here, Ruth.Ruth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time.  It is chaos, with stewards pushing their way through narrow corridorsclogged with peopel carrying suitcases, duffel bags, children. Some havelifebelts on, others don't.                               (to Steward #3)I told the stupid sods no luggage. Aw, bloody hell!He throws up his hand at the sight of a family, loaded down with cases andbags, completely blocking the corridor.Fabrizio and Tommy push past the stewards, going the other way. They rech ahuge crowd gathered at the bottom of the MAIN 3RD CLASS STAIRWELL. Fabriziospots Helga with the rest of the Dahl family, standing patiently withsuitcases in hand. He reaches her and she grins, hugging him.Tommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group. There is asteel gate across the top of the stairs, with several stewards and seamenon the other side. Stay calm, please. It's not time to go up to the boats yet.Near Tommy, an IRISHWOMAN stands stoically with two small children andtheir battered luggage. What are we doing, mummy? We're just waiting, dear. When they fiish putting First Class people in theboats, they'll be startin' with us, and we'll want to be all ready, won'twe?  Boat 7 is less than half full, with 28 aboard a boat made for 65. Lower away! By the left and right together, stady lads!The boat lurches as the falls start to pay out through the pulley blocks.The women gasp. The boat descends, swaying and jerking, toward the water 60feet below. The passengers are terrified.  TRACKING along the rows of portholes angling down into the water. Under thesurface, they glow green. PUSHING IN on one porthole which is havesubmerged. Inside we see Jack, looking apprehensively at the water risingup the glass.INSIDE THE MASTER AT ARMS' OFFICE Jack sits chained to the waterpipe, nextto the porthole. Lovejoy sits on the edge of a desk. He puts a .45 bulleton the desk and watches it roll across and fall off. He picks up thebullet. You know... I believe this ship may sink.                             (crosses to Jack)I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation...He punches Jack hard in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.Lovejoy flips the handcuff key in the air, catches it and puts it in hispocket. He exits. Jack is left gasping, handcuffed to the pipe.  At the stairwell rail on the bridge wing, Fourth Officer Boxhall andQuartermaster Rowe light the first distress rocket. It shoots into the skyand EXPLODES with a thunderclap over the ship, sending out white starburstswhich light up the entire deck as they fall.WHIP PAN off the starbursts to Ismay. The Managing Director of White StarLine is cracking. Already at the breaking point from his immense guilt, therocket panics him. He starts shouting at the officers struggling with thefalls of BOAT 5. There is no time to waste!                       (yelling and waving his arms)Lower away! Lower away! Lower away!FIFTH OFFICER LOWE, a baby-faced 28, and the youngest officer, looks upfrom the tangled falls at the madman. Get out of the way, you fool! Do you know who I am?Lowe, not having a clue nor caring, squares up to Ismay. You're a passenger. And I'm a ship's bloody officer. Now do what you'retold!                                (turning away)Steady men! Stand by the falls!                           (numbly, backing away)Yes, quite right. Sorry.  SECOND OFFICER LIGHTOLLER is loading the boat nearest Cal and Rose... Boat  Women and children only! Sorry sir, no men yet.Another rocket bursts overhead, lighting the crowd. Startled faces turnupward. Fear now in the eyes.DANIEL MARVIN has his Biograph camera set up, cranking away... hoping toget an exposure off the rocket's light. he has Mary posed in front of thescene at the boats. You're afraid, darling. Scared to death. That's it!Either she suddenly learned to act or she is petrified.ROSE watches the farewells taking pace right in front of her as they stepcloser to the boat. Husbands saying goodbye to wives and children. Loversand friends parted. Nearby MOLLY is getting a reluctant woman to board theboat. Come on, you heard the man. Get in the boat, sister. Will the lifeboats be seated according to class? I hope they're not toocrowded-- Oh, Mother shut up!                        (Ruth freezes, mouth open)Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enoughboats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die. Not the better half.PUSH IN ON ROSE'S FACE as it hits her like a thunderbolt. Jack is thirdclass. He doesn't stand a chance. Another rocket bursts overhead, bathingher face in white light. You unimaginable bastard. Come on, Ruth, get in the boat. These are the first class seats right uphere. That's it.Molly practically hands her over to Lightoller, then looks around for someother women who might need a push. Come on, Rose. You're next, darlin'.Rose steps back, shaking her head. Rose, get in the boat! Goodbye, mother.Ruth, standing in the tippy lifeboat, can do nothing. Cal grabs Rose's armbut she pulls free and walks away through the crowd. Cal catches up to Roseand grabs her again, roughly. Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat? I'd rather be his whore than your wife.He clenches his jaw and squeezes her arm viciously, pulling her back towardthe lifeboat. Rose pulls out a hairpin and jabs him with it. he lets gowith a curse and she runs into the crowd. Lower away!! Rose! ROSE!! Stuff a sock in it, would ya, Ruth. She'll be along.The boat lurches downward as the falls are paid out.TRACKING WITH ROSE, as she runs through the clusters of people. She looksback and a furious Cal is coming after her. She runs breathlessly up to twoproper looking men. That man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd!Appalled, they turn to see Cal running toward them. Rose runs on as the twomen grab Cal, restraining him. She runs throught the First Class entrance.Cal breaks free and runs after her. He reaches the entrance, but runs intoa knot of people coming out. He pushes rudely through them...  Cal runs in, and down to the landing, pushing past the gentlemen and ladieswho are filling up the stairs. He scans the A-deck foyer. Rose is gone.  The hull of Titanic looms over Boat 6 like a cliff. Its enormous mass issuddenly threatening to those in the tiny boat. Quartermaster Hitchins, atthe tiller, wants nothing but to get away from the ship. Unfortunately histwo seamen can't row. They flail like a duck with a broken wing. Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull. Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya howit's done.She climbs over Ruth to get at the oars, stepping on her feet.Around them the evacuation is in full swing, with boats in the water,others being lowered.  Jack pulls on the pipe with all his strength. It's not budging. He hearsgurgling sound. Water pours under the door, spreading rapidly across thefloor. Shit.He tries to pull one hand out of the cuffs, working until the skin israw... no good. Help!! Somebody!! Can anybody hear me?!                               (to himself)This could be bad.181 THE CORRIDOR outside is deserted. Flooded a couple of inches deep.Jack's voice comes faintly through the door, but there is no one to hearit.  Thomas Andrews is opening stateroom doors, checking that people are out. Anyone in here?Rose runs up to him, breathless. Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone underarrest?! What? You have to get to a boat right away! No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will takelonger.                                   (beat)Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage,then make a right. Bottom, left, right. I have it. Hurry, Rose.  Rose runs up as the last Elecator Operator is closing up his lift to leave. Sorry, miss, lifts are closed--Without thinking she grabs him and shoves him back into the lift. I'm through with being polite, goddamnit!! I may never be polite the restof my life! Now take me down!!The operator fumbles to close the gate and start the lift.  Molly and the two seamen are rowing, and they've made it a hundret feet orso. Enough to see that the ship is angled down into the water, with the bowrail less than ten feet above the surface. Come on girls, join in, it'll keep ya warm. Let's go Ruth. Grab an oar!Ruth just stares at the spectacle of the great liner, its rows of lightsblazing, slanting down into the sullen black mirror of the Atlanic.  Through the wrought iron door of the elevator car Rose can see the decksgoing past. The lift slows. Suddenly ICE WATER is swirling around her legs.She SCREAMS in surprise. So does the operator.The car has landed in a foot of freezing water, shocking the hell out ofher. She claws the door open and splashes out, hiking up her floor-lengthskirt so she can move. The lift goes back up, behind her, as she looksaround. Left, crew passage.She spots it and slogs down the flooded corridor. The place isunderstandably deserted. She is on her own. Right, right... right.She turns into a cross-corridor, splashing down the hall. A row of doors oneach side. Jack? Jaaacckk??  Jack is hopelessly pulling on the pipe again, straining until he turns red.He collapses back on the bench. realizing he's screwed. Then he hears herthrough the door. ROSE!! In here!187 IN THE HALL Rose hears his voice behind her. She spins and runs back,locating the right door, then pushes it open, creating a small wave.She splashes over Jack and puts her arms around him. Jack, Jack, Jack... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.They are so happy to see each other it's embarrassing. That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket. I know, I know. See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brassone.She kisses his face and hugs him again, then starts to go through the desk. So... how did you find out I didn't do it? I didn't.                            (she looks at him)I just realized I already knew.They share a look, then she goes back to ransacking the room, searchingdrawers and cupboards. Jack sees movement out the porthole and looks out.A LIFEBOAT hits the surface of the water, seen from below.  While the seamen detach the falls, Boat One rocks next to the hull. Lucileand Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon sit with ten others in a boat made for four timesthat many. I despise small boats. I just know I'm going to be seasick. I always getseasick in small boats. Good Heavens, there's a man down there.In a lit porthole beneath the surface she sees Jack looking up at her... aface in a bubble of light under the water.  Rose stops trashing the room, and stands there, breathing hard. There's no key in here.They look around at the water, now almost two feet deep. Jack has pulledhis feet up onto the bench. You have to go for help.                                  (nodding)I'll be right back. I'll wait here.She runs out, looking back at him once from the doorway, then splashesaway. Jack looks down at the swirling water.  Rose splashes down the hall to a stairwell going up to the next deck. Sheclimbs the stairs, her long skirt leaving a trail like a giant snail. Theweight of it is really slowing her down. She rips at the buttons andshimmies quickly out of the thing. She bounds up the stairs in herstockings and knee-length slip, to find herself in--191 A LONG CORRIDOR... part of the labyrinth of steerage hallways forward.She is alone here. A long groan of stressing metal echoes along the hall asthe ship continues to settle. She runs down the hall, unimpeded now. Hello? Somebody?!She turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. The hallslopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light. The margin ofthe water creeps toward her. A YOUNG MAN appears, running through thewater, sending up geysers of spray. He pelts past her without slowing, hiseyes crazed... Help me! We need help!He doesn't look back. It is like a bad dream. The hull gongs withterrifying sounds.The lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. A beat. Then theycome back on. She finds herself hyperventilating. That one moment ofblackness was the most terrifying of her life.A STEWARD runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts. He isupset to see someone still in his section. He grabs her forcefully by thearm, pulling her with him like a wayward child. Come on, then, let's get you topside, miss, that's right. Wait. Wait! I need your help! There's-- No need for panic, miss. Come along! No, let me go! You're going the wrong way!He's not listening. And he won't let her go.She SHOUTS in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in thenose. Shocked, he lets her go and staggers back. To Hell with you! See you there, buster!The steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. She spits after him. Justthe way Jack taugh: her.She turns around, SEES: a glass case with a fire-axe in it. She breaks theglass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizesthe axe, running back the way she came.192 AT THE STAIRWELL she looks down and gasps. The water has flooded thebottom five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along thecorridor to the room where Jack is trapped.Rose plunges into the water, which is up to her waist... and powersforward, holding the axe above her head in two hands. She grimaces at thepain from the literally freezing water.  Jack has climbed up on the bench, and is hugging the waterpipe. Rose wadesin, holding the axe above her head. Will this work? We'll find out.They are both terrified, but trying to keep panic at bay. He positions thechain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it taut across the steel pipe.The chain is of course very short, and his exposed wrists are on eitherside of it. Try a couple practice swings.Rose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet. Now try to hit the same mark again.She swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the mark. Okay, that's enough practice.He winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe. She has to hit a targetabout an inch wide with all the foce she can muster, with his hands oneither side.                               (sounding calm)You can do it, Rose. Hit it as hard as you can, I trust you.Jack closes his eyes. So does she.The axe comes down. K-WHANG! Rose gingerly opens her eyes looks... Jack isgrinning with two separate cuffs.Rose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her. Nice work, there, Paul Bunyan.He climbs down into the water next to her. He can't breathe for a second. Shit! Excuse my French. Ow ow ow, that is cold! Come on, let's go.They wade out into the hall. Rose starts toward the stiars going up, butJack stops her. There is only about a foot of the stairwell openingvisible. Too deep. We gotta find another way out.  TIGHT ON THE LETTERS TITANIC painted two feet high on the bow of the doomedsteamer. Once 50 feet above the waterline, they now quietly slip below thesurface. We see them, gold on black, rippling and dimming to a pale greenas they go deeper.195 IN BOAT SIX, Ruth looks back at the Titanic, transfixed by the sight ofthe dying liner. The bowsprit is now barely above the waterline. Another ofBoxhall's rockets EXPLODES overhead. K-BOOM! It lights up the whole area,and we see half a dozen boats in the water, spreading out from the ship. Now there's somethin' you don't see every day.  The widest passageway in the ship, it is used by crew and steerage alike,and runs almost the length of the ship. Right now steerage passengers movealong it like refugees, heading aft.CRASH! A wooden doorframe splinters and the door bursts open under theforce of Jack's shoulder. Jack and Rose stumble through, into the corridor.A STEWARD, who was nearby herding people along, marches over. Here you! You'll have to pay for that, you know. That's White Star Lineproperty--                             (turning together)Shutup!Jack leads her past the dumbfounded steward. They join the steeragestragglers going aft. In places the corridor is almost completely blockedby large families carrying all their luggage.AN IRISH WOMAN gives Rose a blanket, more for modesty than because she isblue-lipped and shivering. Here, lass, cover yerself.Jack rubs her arms and tries to warm her up as they walk along. The woman'shusband offers them a flask of whiskey. This'll take the chill off.Rose takes a mighty belt and hands it to Jack. He grins and follows suit.Jack tries a number of DOORS and IRON GATES along the way, finding them alllocked.  ON THE BOAT DECK, the action has moved to the aft group of boats, numbers9, 11, 13 and 15 on the starboard side, and 10, 12, 14 and 16 on the portside. The pace of work is more frantic. You see crew and officers runningnow to work the davits, their previous complacency gone.CAL pushes through the crowd, scanning for Rose. Around him is chaos andconfusion. A woman is calling for a child who has become seperated from thecrowd. A man is shouting over people's heads. A woman takes hold of SecondOfficer Lightoller's arm as he is about to launch Boat 10. Will you hold the boat a moment? I have to run back to my room forsomething--Lightoller grabs her and shoves her bodily into the boat. Thomas Andrewsrushes up to him just then. Why are the boats being launched half full?!Lightoller steps past him, helping a seaman clear a snarled fall. Not now, Mr. Andrews.                        (pointing down at the water)There, look... twenty or so in a boat built for sixty five. And I saw oneboat with only twelve. Twelve! Well... we were not sure of the weight-- Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast with the weight of 70 men. Now fillthese boats, Mr. Lightoller. For God's sake, man!The shot HANDS OFF to Cal, who sees Lovejoy hurrying toward him through theaisle connecting the port and starboard sides of the boat deck. She's not on the starboard side either. We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...                          (indicating Lightoller)...isn't letting any men in at all. The one on the other side is letting men in. Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.                          (he starts off forward)Come on.Cal charges off, heading forward, followed by Lovejoy. The SHOT HANDS OFFto a finely dressed elderly couple, IDA and ISADOR STRAUSS. Please, Ida, get into the boat. No. We've been together for forty years, and where  you go, I go. Don't argue with me, Isador, you know it does no good.He looks at her with sadness and great love. They embrace gently. Lower away!!  AT THE BOW... the place where Jack and Rose first kissed... the bow railinggoes under water water. Water swirls around the captsans and windlasses onthe foc'sle deck.Smith strides to the bridge rail and looks down at the well deck. Water isshipped over the sides and the well deck is awash. Two men run across thedeck, their feet sending up spray. Behind Smith, Boxhall fires anotherrocket. WHOOSH!    Fabrizio, standing with Helga Dahl and her family, hears Jack's voice. Fabrizio! Fabri!Fabrizio turns and sees Jack and Rose pushing through the crowd. He andJack hug like brothers. The boats are all going. We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?Fabrizio points over the heads of the solidly packed crowd to thestairwell.Tommy has his hands on the bars of the steel gate which blocks the head ofthe stairwell. The crew open the gate a foot or so and a few women aresqueezing through. Women only. No men. No men!!But some terrified men, not understanding English, try to rush through thegap, forcing the gate open. The crewmen and stewards push them back,shoving and punching them. Get back! Get back you lot!                             (to the crewmen)Lock it!!They struggle to get the gate closed again, while Steward #2 brandishes asmall revolver. Another holds a fire axe. They lock the gate, and a crygoes up among the crowd, who surge forward, pounding against the steel andshouting in several languages. For the love of God, man, there are children down here! Let us up, so wecan have a chance!But the crewmen are scared now. They have let the situation get out ofhand, and now they have a mob. Tommy gives up and pushes his way backthrough the crowd, going down the stairs. He rejoins Jack, Rose andFabrizio. It's hopeless that way. Well, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast.Fabrizio turns to Helga, praying he can make himself understood.                        (with a lot of hand gestures)Everyone... all of you... come with me now. We go to the boats. We go tothe boats. Capito? Come now!They can't understand what he's saying. They can see his urgency, but OLUFDAHL, the patriarch of the family, shakes his head. He will not panic, andwill not let his family go with this boy. Fabrizio turns to Helga. Helga... per favore... please... come with me, I am lucky. Is my destiny togo to America.She kisses him, then steps back to be with her family. Jack lays a hand onhis shoulder, his eyes saying ""Let's go"". I will never forget you.He turns to Jack, who leads the way out of the crowd. Looking back Fabriziosees her face disappear into the crowd.    CLUNK! Cal opens his safe and reaches inside. As Lovejoy watches, he pullsout two stacks of bills, still banded by bank wrappers. Then he takes out""Heart of the Ocean"", putting it in the pocket of his overcoat, and locksthe safe.                        (holding up stacks of bills)I make my own luck.                     (putting the .45 in his waistband)So do I.Cal grins, putting the money in his pocket as they go out.  Jack, Rose, Fabrizio and Tommy are lost, searching for a way out. They pushpast confused passengers... past a mother changing her baby's diaper on topof an upturned steamer trunk... past a woman arguing heatedly with a man inSerbo-Croatian, a wailing child next to them... past a man kneeling toconsole a woman who is just sitting on the floor, sobbing... and pastanother man with an English/Arabic dictionary, trying to figure out whatthe signs mean, while his wife and children wait patiently.Jack et al come upon a narrow stairwell and they go up two decks beforethey are stopped by a small group pressed up against a steel gate. Thesteerage men are yelling at a scared STEWARD. Go to the main stairwell, with everyone else. It'll all get sorted outthere.Jack takes one look at this scene and finally just loses it. God damn it to Hell son of a bitch!!He grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the landing. He startspulling on it, and Tommy and Fabrizio pitch in until the bolts shear and itbreaks free. Rose figures out what they are doing and clears a path up thestairs between the waiting people. Move aside! Quickly, move aside!Jack and Tommy run up the steps with the bench and RAM IT INTO THE GATEwith all their strength. It rips loose from its track and falls outward,narrowly mssing the steward. Led by Jack, the crowd surges though. Rosesteps up to the cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone: If you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job  with the White Star Line, I suggest you escort these good people to theboat deck... now.Class wins out. He nods dumbly motions form them to follow.  Ruth rows with Molly Brown, two other women and the incompetent sailors.She rests on her oars, exhausted, and looks back at the ship.It slants down into the water, still ablaze with light. Nothing is abovewater forward of the bridge except for the foremast. Another rocket goesoff, lighting up the entire area... there are a dozen boats moving outwardfrom the ship.207 AT THE BOAT DECK RAIL Captain Smith is shouting to Boat 6 through alarge metal megaphone. Come back! Come back to the ship!CHIEF OFFICER WILDE joins him, blowing his silver whistle.208 FROM BOAT 6 the whistle comes shrilly across the water. QuartermasterHitchins grips the rudder in fear. The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going. We got room for lots more. I say we go back. No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Nowrow!!209 CAPTAIN SMITH, at the rail of the boat deck, lowers his megaphoneslowly The fools.  As Cal and Lovejoy cross the foyer encounter Benjamin Guggenheim and hisvalet, coth dressed in white tie, tail-coats and top hats. Ben, what's the occasion? We have dressed in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen. That's admirable, Ben.                               (walking on)I'll sure and tell your wife... when I get to New York.  There are still two cardgames in progress. The room is quiet and civilized.A silver serving cart, holding a large humidor, begins to roll slowlyacross the room. One of the cardplayers takes a cigar from it as it rollsby. It seems we've been dealt a bad hand this time.  Cal and Lovejoy are walking aft with a purposeful stride. They pass CHIEFBAKER JOHGHIN, who is working up a sweat tossing deck chairs over the rail.After they go by, Joughin takes a break and pulls a bottle of scotch from apocket, opening it. He drains it, and tosses it over the side too, thenstands there a little unteadily.  PANIC IS SETTING IN around the remaining boats aft. The crowd here is now amix of all three classes. Officers repeatedly warn men back from the boats.The crowd presses in closer.Seamen SCAROTT brandishes the tiller of boat 14 to discourage a close pressof men who look ready to rush the boat. Several men break ranks and rushforward.Lightoller pulls out his Webley revolver and aims it at them. Get back! Keep order!The men back down. Fifth Officer Lowe standing in the boat, yells to thecrew. Lower away left and right!Lightoller turns away from the crowd and, out of their sight, breaks hispistol open. Letting out a long breath, he starts to LOAD IT.  Cal and Lovejoy arrive in time to see Murdoch lowering his last boat. We're too late. There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seemsto be quite... practical.215 IN THE WATER BELOW there is another panic. Boat 13, already in thewater but still attached to its falls, is pushed aft by the discharge waterbeing pumped out of the ship. It winds up directly under boat 15, which iscoming downt he right on top of it.The passengers shout in panic to the crew above to stop lowering. They areignored. Some men put their hands up, trying futilely to keep the 5 tons ofboat 15 from crushing them.Fred Barrett, the stoker, gets out his knife and leaps to the after falls,climbing rudely over people. He cuts the aft falls while another crewmancuts the forward lines. 13 drifts out from beneath 15 just seconds beforeit touches the water with a slap.Cal, looking down from the rail hears GUNSHOTS--  Fifth Officer Lowe, in Boat 14 is firing his gun as a warning to a bunch ofmen threatening to jump into the boat as it passes the open promenade onA-Deck. Stay back you lot!   The shots echo away. It's starting to fall apart. We don't have much time.Cal sees three dogs run by, including the black French bulldog. Someone hasreleased the pets from the kennels.Cal sees Murdoch turn from the davits of boat 15 and start walking towardthe bow. He catches up and falls in beside him. Mr. Murdoch, I'm a businessman, as you know, and I have a businessproposition for you.   Jack, Rose et al burst out onto the boat deck from the crew stairs just aftof the third funnel. They look at the empty davits. The boats are gone!She sees Colonel Gracie chugging forward along the deck, escorting twofirst class ladies. Colonel! Are there any boats left?                      (staring at her bedraggled state)Yes, miss... there are still a couple of boats all the way forward. Thisway, I'll lead you!Jack grabs her hand and they sprint past Gracie, with Tommy and Fabrizioclose behind.ANGLE ON THE BAND... incredibly they are still playing. Jack, Rose and theothers run by. Music to drown by. Now I know I'm in First Class.  Water pours like a spillway over the forward railing on B-Deck. CAMERASWEEPS UP past A-Deck to the Boat Deck where Murdoch and his team areloading Collapsible Car the forward-most davits.NOTE: There are four so-called collapsibles, or Engelhardts boats,including two which are stored on the roof of the officer's quarters.The crowd is sparse, with most people still aft. Cal slips his hand out ofhte pocket of his overcoat and into the waist pocket of Murdoch'sgreatcoat, leaving the stacks of bills there. So we have an understanding then?                              (nodding curtly)As you've said.Cal, satisfied, steps back. He finds himself waiting next to J. BruceIsmay. Ismay does not meet his eyes, nor anyone's. Lovejoy come sup to Calat that moment. I've found her. She's just over on the port side. With him. Women and children? Any more women and children?                             (glancing at Cal)Any one else, then?Cal looks longingly at his boat... his moment has arrived. God damn it to hell! Come on.He and Lovejoy head for the port side, taking a short-cut through thebridge.Bruce Ismay, seeing his oppurtunity, steps quickly into Collapsible C. Hestares straight ahead, not meeting Murdoch's eyes.                             (staring at Ismay)Take them down.  ON THE PORT SIDE Lightoller is getting people into Boat 2. He keeps hispistol in his hand at this point. Twenty feet below them the sea is pouringinto the doors and windows of B deck staterooms. They can hear the roar ofwater cascading into the ship. Women and children, please. Women and children only. Step back, sir.Even with Jack's arms wrapped around her, Rose is shivering in the cold.Near her a WOMAN with TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS looks into the eyes of a HUSBANDshe knows she may not see again Goodbye for a little while... only for a little while.                         (to his two little girls)Go with mummy.The woman stumbles to the boat with the children, hiding her tears fromthem. Beneath the false good cheer, the man is choked with emotion. Hold mummy's hand and be a good girl. That's right.Some of the women are stoic, others are overwhelmed by emotion and have tobe helped into the boats. A MAN scribbles a note and hands it to a womanwho is about to board. Please get this to my wife in DeMoines, Iowa.Jack looks at Tommy and Fabrizio. You better check out the other side.They nod and run off, searching for a way around the deckhouse. I'm not going without you. Get in the boat, Rose.Cal walks up just then. Yes. Get in the boat, Rose.She is shocked to see him. She steps instinctively to Jack. Cal looks ather, standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings, a shockingdisplay in 1912. My God, look at you.                           (taking off his boat)Here, put this on.She numbly shrugs into it. He is doing it for modesty, not the cold. Quickly, ladies. Step into the boat. Hurry, please! Go on. I'll get the next one. No. Not without you!She doesn't even care that Cal is standing right there. He sees the emotionbetween Jack and Rose and his jaw clenches. But then he leans close to herand says...                                    (low)There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I canget off safely. Both of us.                          (he smiles reassuringly)I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat tocatch. Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.Lightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat. She reaches out forJack and her fingers brush his for a moment. Then she finds herselfstepping down into the boat. It's all a rush and blur. Lower away!The two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend.                                    (low)You're a good liar. Almost as good as you. I always win, Jack. One way or another.                          (looks at him, smiling)Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more bymorning.Jack knows he is screwed. He looks down at Rose, not wanting to waste asecond of his last view of her.222 ROSE'S PERCEPTION... IN SLOW MOTION: The ropes going through thepulleys as the seamen start to lower. All sound going away... Lightollergiving orders, his lips moving... but Rose hears only the blood pounding inher ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above inslow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light... Rose's hair blowing inslow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him... she seeshis hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannotbelieve the unbearable pain she is feeling...Rose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face.SUDDENLY SHE IS MOVING. She lunges across the women next to her. Reachesthe gunwale, climbing it...Hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the A-Deck promenade, catchingit, and scrambling over the rail. The Boat 2 continues down. But Rose isback on Titanic. No Rose! NOOOO!!Jack spins from the rail, running for the nearest way down to A-Deck.Hockley too has seen her jump. She is willing to die for this man, thisgutter scum. He is overwhelmed by a rage so all consuming it eclipses allthought.  TRACKING WITH JACK as he bangs through the doors to the foyer and sprintsdown the stairs. He sees her coming into A-deck foyer, running toward him,Cal's long coat flying out behind her as she runs.They meet at the bottom of the stairs, and collide in an embrace. Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot--And all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can. You jump, I jump, right? Right.Hockley comes in and runs to the railing. Looking down he sees them lockedin their embrace. Lovejoy comes up behind Cal and puts a restraining HANDon him, but Cal whips around, grabbing the pistol from Lovejoy's waistbandin one cobra-fast move.He RUNS along the rail and down the stairs. As he reaches the landing abovethem he raises the gun. SCREAMING in rage, he FIRES.The carved cherub at the foot of the center railing EXPLODES. Jack pullsRose toward the stairs going down to the next deck. Cal fires again,running down the steps toward them. A bullet blows a divet out of the oakpanelling behind Jack's head as he pulls Rose down the next flight ofstairs.Hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goessprawling. The gun clatters across the marble floor. He gets up, andreeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it.  The bottom of the grand staircase is flooded several feet deep. Jack andRose come down the stairs two at a time and run straight into the water,fording across the room to where the floor slopes up, until they reach dryfooting at the entrance to the dining saloon.STEADICAM WITH HOCKLEY as he reels down the stairs in time to see Jack andRose splashing through the water toward the dining saloon. He FIRES twice.Big gouts of spray near them, but he's not a great shot.The water boils up around his feet and he retreast up the stairs a coupleof steps. Around him the woodward groans and creaks.                              (calling to them)Enjoy your time together!!Lovejoy arrives next to him. Cal suddenly remembers something and starts tolaugh. What could possible be funny? I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.He turns to Lovejoy with a sickly expression, his eyes glittering. I give it to you... if you can get it.He hands Lovejoy the pistol and goes back up the stairs. Lovejoy thinksabout it... then slogs into the water. The icewater is up to his waist ashe crosses the pool into the dining saloon.  Lovejoy moves among the tables and ornate columns, searching...listening... his eyes tracking rapidly. It is a sea of tables, and theycould be anywhere. A silver serving tolley rolls downhill, bumping intotables and pillars.He glances behind him. The water is following him into the room, advancingin a hundred foot wide tide. The reception room is now a roiling lake, andthe grand staircase is submerged past the first landing. Monstrous groansecho through the ship.ON JACK AND ROSE, crouched behind a table, somewhere in the middle. Theysee the water advancing toward them, swirling over the floor. They crawlahead of it to the next row of tables.                                (whispering)Stay here.He moves off as--Lovejoy moves over one row and looks along the tables. Nothing.The ship GROANS and CREAKS. He moves another row.ANGLE ON A METAL CART... five feet tall and full of stacks of china dishes.It starts to roll down the aisle between tables.ON ROSE as the cart rolls toward her. It hits a table and the stacks ofdishes topple out, EXPLODING across the floor and showering her.She scrambles out of the way and--Lovejoy spins, seeing her. He moves rapidly toward her, keeping the gunaimed--That's when Jack tackles him from the side. They slam together into atable, crashing over it, and toppling to the floor. They land in the waterwhich is flowing rapidly between the tables.Jack and Lovejoy grapple in the icy water. Jack jams his knee down onLovejoy's hand, breaking his grip on the pistol, and kicks it away. Lovejoyscrmbles up and lunges at him, but Jack GUTPUCHES him right in the solarplexus, doubling him over. Compliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.He grabs Lovejoy and slams him into an ornate columb. Lovejoy drops to thefloor with a splas, stunned. Let's go.Jack and Rose run aft... uphill... entering the galley. Behind them thetables have become islands in a lake... and the far end of the room isflooded up to the ceiling.Lovejoy gets up and looks around for his gun. He pulls it up out of thewater and wades after them.  They run throught the galley and Rose spots the stairs. She starts up andJack grabs her hand. He leads her DOWN.They crouch together on the landing as Lovejoy runs to the stairs. Assumingthey have gone up (who wouldn't?) he clombs up them two at a time.They wait for the footstep to recede. A long CREAKING GROAN. Then they hearit... a CRYING CHILD. Below them. They go down a frew steps to looks alongthe next deck.  The corridor is awash, about a foot deep. Standing against the wall, about50 feet away, is a little BOY, aobut 3. The water swirls around his legsand he is wailing. We can't leave him.Jack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the stairwell to run tothe child. Jack scoops up the kid and they run back to the stairs but--A torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids. In seconds itis too powerful for them to go against. Come on.Charging the other way down the flooding corridor, they blast up spray witheach footstep. At the end of the hall are heavy double doors. As Jackapproaches them he sees water spraying through the gap between the doorsright up to the ceiling. The doors groan and start to crack under the tonsof pressure. Back! Go back!!Rose pivots and runs back the way they came, taking a turn into across-corridor. A MAN is coming the other way. He sees the boy in Jack'sarms and cries out, grabbing him away from Jack. Starts cursing him inRussian. He runs on with the boy-- No! Not that way! Come back!228 DOUBLE DOORS BLAST OPEN. A wall of water thunders into the corridor.The father and child DISAPPEAR instantly.Jack and Rose run as a wave blasts around the corner, foaming from floor toceiling. It gains on them like a locomotive. They make it to a stairwaygoing up.  Jack and Rose pound up the steps as white water swirls up behind them. PULLBACK to reveal that a steel gate blocks the top of the stairs. Jack SLAMSagainst the fate, gripping the bars.A terrified steward standing guard on the landing above turns to run at thesight of the water thundering up the stairs. Wait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate.The steward runs on. The water wells up around Jack and Rose, pouringthrough the gate and slamming them against it. In seconds it is up to theirwaist. Help us! Please!The steward stops and looks back. He sees Jack and Rose at the gate, theirarms raching through... sees the water POURING through the gate onto thelanding. Fucking 'ell!He runs back, slogging against the curretn. He pulls a key ring from hisbelt and struggles to unlock the padlock as the water fountains up aroundthem.The lights short out and the landing is plunged into darkness.The water rises over the lock and he's doing it by feel. Come on! Come on!Jack and Rose are right up against the ceiling...Suddenly the gate gives and SWINGS OPEN. They are pushing through by theforce of the water. They make it to stairs on the other side of the landingand follow the steward up to the next deck.  Cal comes reeling out of the first class entrance, looking wild-eyed. Thelurches down the deck toward the bridge. Waltz music wafts over the ship.Somewhere the band is still playing.CAL'S POV: A little girl, maybe two years old, is crying along in thealcove. She looks up at Cal beseechingly. Cal moves on without a glanceback... reaching a large crowd clustered around COLLAPSIBLE A just aft ofthe bridge. He sees Murdoch and a number of crewmen struggling to drag theboat to the davits, with no luck.Cal pushes forward, trying to signal Murdoch, but the officer ignores him.Nearby Tommy and Fabrizio are being pushed forward by the crowd behind.PURSER MCELROY pushes them back, getting a couple of seamen to help him. Hebrandishes his gun, waving it in the air, yelling for the crowd to stayback.  Lightoller, with a group of crew and passengers, is trying to getCollapsible B down from the roof. They slide it down a pair of oars leanedagainst the deck house. Hold it! Hold it!The weight of the boat snaps the oars and it crashes to the deck, upsidedown. The two Swedish cousins, OLAUS and BJORN GUNERSEN, jump back as theboat nearly hits them.   Jack and Rose run up seemingly endless stairs as the ship groans andtorgues around them.  Murdoch, at Collapsible A, is no longer in control. The crowd isthreatening to rush the boat. They push and jostle, yelling and shouting atthe officers. The pressure from behind pushes them forward, and one guyfalls off the edge of the deck into the water less than ten feet below. Give us a chance to live, you limey bastards!Murdoch fires his Webley twice in the air, then point it at the crowd. I'll shoot any man who tries to get past me.Cal steps up to him. We had a deal, damn you.Murdoch pushes him back, pointing the pistol at Cal. Get back!A man next to Tommy rushes forward, and Tommy is shoved from behind.Murdoch SHOOTS the first man, and seeing Tommy coming forward, puts abullet into his chest.Tommy collapses, and Fabrizio grabs him, holding him in his arms as hislife flows out over the deck.Murdoch turns to his men and salutes smartly. Then he puts the pistol tohis temple and... BLAM! He drops like a puppet with the strings cut andtopples over the edge of the boat deck into the water only a few feetbelow.Cal stares in horror at Murdoch's body bobbing in the black water. TheMONEY FLOATS out of the pocket of his greatcoat, the bills spreading acrossthe surface.The crew rush to get the last few women aboart the boat.                        (calling above the confusion)Any more women or children?!THE CHILD crying in the alcove. Cal scoops her up and runs forward,cradling her in his arms.                     (forcing his way through the crowd)Here's a child! I've got a child!                                (to McElroy)Please... I'm all she has in the world.McElroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat. He spins with his gun,brandishing it in the air to keep the other men back. Cal gets into theboat, holding the little girl. He takes a seat with the women. There, there.  Thomas Andrews stands in front of the fireplace, staring at the largepainting above the mantle. The fire is still going in the fireplace.The room is empty except for Andrews. An ashtray falls off the table.Behind him Jack and Rose run into the room, out of breath and soaked. Theyrun through, toward the aft revolving door... then Rose recognizes him. Shesees that his lifebelt is off, lying on a table. Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?                        (a tear rolls down his cheek)I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.                                  (to her)It's going fast... we've got to keep moving.Andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her. Good luck to you, Rose.                                (hugging him)And to you, Mr. Andrews.Jack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door.  The band finishes the waltz. Wallace Hartley looks at the orchestramembers. Right, that's it then.They leave him, walking forward along the deck. Hartley puts his violin tohis chin and bows the first notes of ""Nearer My God to Thee"". One by onethe band memebers turn, hearing the lonely melody.Without a word they walk back and take their places. They join in withHartley, filling out the sound so that it reaches all over the ship on thisstill night. The vocalist begins: ""If in my dreams I be, nearer my God tothee..."" 237 A seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to Captain Smith as hewalks to the bridge. He proffers it, but Smith seems to stare through him.Without a word he turns and goes onto the bridge. He enters the enclosedWHEELHOUSE and closes the door. He is alone, surrounded by the gleamingbrass instruments. He seems to inwardly collapse.238 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Andrews stands like a statue. He pullsout his pocketwatch and checks the time. Then he opens the face of themantle clock and adjusts it to the correct time: 2:12 a.m. Everything mustbe correct.239 IN CAL'S PARLOUR SUITE water swirls in from the private promenade deck.Rose's paintings are submerged. The Picasso tranforms under the water'ssurface. Degas' colors run. Monet's water lilies come to life.240 DOWNANGLE on the two figures lying side by side, fully clothed, on abed in a FIRST CLASS CABIN. Elderly Ida and Isador Strauss stare at theceiling, holding hands like young lovers. Water pours into the room througha doorway. It swirls around the bed, two feet deep rising fast.241 IN A STEERAGE CABIN somewhere in the bowels of the ship, the youngIRISH MOTHER, seen earlier stoically waiting at the stairs, is tucking hertwo young children into bed. She pulls up the covers, making sure they areall warm and cozy. She lies down with them on the bed, speaking soothinglyand holding them.  242 IN A WIDE SHOT we see a wave travel up the boat deck as the bridgehouse sinks into the water.243 ON THE PORT SIDE Collapsible B is picked up by water. Workingfrantically, the men try to detach it from the falls so the ship won't dragit under. Colonel Gracie hands Lightoller a pocket knife and he sawsfuriously at the ropes as the water swirls around his legs. The boat, stillupside down, is swept off the ship. Men start diving in, swimming to staywith it.244 IN COLLAPSIBLE A Cal sits next to the wailing child, whom he hascompletely forgotten. He watches the water rising around the men as theywork, scrambling to get the ropes cut so the ship won't drag thecollapsible under.Fabrizio removes the lifebelt from Tommy's body and struggles to put it onas the water rises around him.245 CAPTAIN SMITH, standing near the wheel, watches the black waterclimbing the windows of the enclosed wheelhouse. He has the strickenexpression of a damned sould on Judgment Day. The windows burst suddenlyand a wall of water edged with shards of glass slams into Smith. Hedisappears in a vortex of foam.246 Collapsible A is hit by a wave as the bow plunges suddenly. Itpartially swamps the boat, washing it along the deck. Over a hundredpassengers are plunged into the freezing water and the area around the boatbecomes a frenzy of splashing, screaming people.As men are trying to climb into the callapsible, Cal grabs an oar andpushes them back into the water. Get back! You'll swamp us!Fabrizio, swimming for his life, gets swirled under a davit. The ropes andpulleys tangle around him as the davit goes under the water, and he isdragged down. Underwater he struggles to free himself, and then kicks backto the surface. He surfaces, gasping for air in the freezing water.247 WALLACE HARTLEY sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them.He holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain, and then lowers hisviolin. Gentlemen, it has been a previlege playing with you tonight.  Jack and Rose run out of the PALM COURT into a dense crowd. Jack pushes hisway to the rail and looks at the state of the ship. The bridge is underwater and tehre is chaos on deck. Jack helps her put her lifebelt on.People stream around them, shouting and pushing. Okay... we keep moving aft. We have to stay on the ship as long aspossible.They push their way aft through the panicking crowd.  Collapsible A is whirled like a leaf in the currents around the siningship. It slams against the side of the forward funnel.                          (to the crew in the boat)Row! Row you bastards!!250 NEARBY: Fabrizio is drawn up against the grating of a STOKEHOLD VENT aswater pours through it. The force of tons of water roaring down the shiptraps him against it, and he is dragged down under the surface as the shipsinks. He struggles to free himself but cannot.Suddenly there is a concussion deep in the bowels of the ship as a furnaceexplodes and a blast of hot air belches out of hte ventilator, ejectingFabrizio. He surfaces in a roar of foam and keeps swimming.  Jack and Rose clamber over the A-Deck aft rail. Then, using all hisstrength, he lowers her toward the deck below, holding on with one hand.She dangles, then falls. Jack jumps down behind her.They join a crush of people literally clawing and scrambling over eachother to get down the narrow stairs to the well deck... the only way aft.Seeing that the stairs are impossible, Jack climbs over the B-Deck railingand helps Rose over. He lowers her again, and she falls in a heap. BakerJoughin, now three sheets to the wind, happens to be next to her. He haulsRose to her feet. Jack drops down and the three of them push through thecrowd across the well deck. Near them, at the rail, people are jumping intothe water.The ship GROANS and SHUDDERS. The man ahead of Jack is walking like azombie. Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death-- You wanna walk a little faster through that valley, fella?  The stay cables along the top of the funnel snap, and they lash like steelwhips down into the water. Cal watches as the funnel topples from itsmounts. Falling like a temple pillar twenty eight feet across it whompsinto the water with a tremendous splash. People swimming underneath itdisappear in an instant.Fabrizio, a few feet away, is hurled back by a huge wave. He comes up,gasping... still swimming. The water pouring into the open end of thefunnel draws in several swimmers. The funnel sinks, disappearing, but--Hundreds of tons of water pour down through the 30 foot hole where thefunnel stood, thundering down into the belly of the ship. A whirlpoolforms, a hole in the ocean, like at enormous toiler-flush. T. W. McCauley,the gym instructor swims in a frenzy as the vortex draws him in. He issucked down like a spider going down a drain.Fabrizio, nearby, swims like Hell as more people are sucked down behindhim. He manages to get clear. He's going to live no matter what it takes.  Water raors through the doors and windows, cascading down the stairs like arapids. John Jacob Astor is swept down the marble steps to A-Deck, which isalready flooded... a roiling vortex. He grabs the headless cherub at thebottom of the staircase and wraps his arms around it.Astor looks up in time to see the 30 foot glass dome overhead EXPLOSEINWARD with the wave of water washing over it. A Niagara of sea waterthunders down into the room, blasting through the first class opulence. ITis the Armageddon of elegance.   The flooding is horrific. Walls and doors are splintered like kindling.Water roars down corridors with pile-driver force.The CARTMELL FAMILY is at the top of a stairwell, jammed against a lockedgate like Jack and Rose were. Water boils up the stairwell behind them.Bert Cartmell shakes the gate futilely, shouting for help. Little Corawails as the water boils up around them all.  Rose and Jack struggle to climb the well deck stairs as the ship tilts.Drunk Baker Joughin puts a hand squarely on Rose's butt and shoves her uponto the deck. Sorry, miss!Hundreds of people are already on the poop deck, and more are pouring upevery second. Jack and Rose cling together as tehy struggle across thetilting deck.257 As the bow goes down, the STERN RISES. IN BOAT 2, which is just off thestern, passengers gape as the giant bronze propellers rise out of the waterlike gods of the deep, FILLING FRAME behind them.People are JUMPING from the well deck, the poop deck, the gangway doors.Some hit debris in the water and are hurt or killed.   ON THE POOP DECK Jack and Rose struggle aft as the angle increases.Hundreds of passengers, clinging to every fixed object on deck, huddle ontheir knees around FATHER BYLES, who has his voice raised in prayer. Theyare praying, sobbing, or just staring at nothing, their minds blank withdread.Pulling himself from handhold to handhold, Jack tugs Rose aft along thedeck. Come on, Rose. We can't expect God to do all the work for us.They struggle on, pushing through the praying people. A MAN loses hisfooting ahead and slides toward them. Jack helps him.261 THE PROPELLERS are twenty feet above the water and rising faster.262 JACK AND ROSE make it to the stern rail, right at the base of theflagpole. They grip the rai, jammed in between other people. It is the spotwhere Jack pulled her back onto the ship, just two night... and aliftime... ago.Above the wailing and sobbing, Father Byles' voice carries, cracking withemotion. ...and I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the formerearth had passed away and the sea was no longer.The lights flicker, threatening to go out. Rose grips Jack as the sternrises into a night sky ablaze with stars. I also saw a new Jerusalem, the holy city coming down out of heaven fromGod, beautiful as a bride prepared to meet her husband. I heard a loudvoice from the throne ring out this is God's dwelling among men. He shalldwell with them and they shall be his people and He shall be their God whois alway with them.Rose stares about her at the faces of the doomed. Near them are the DAHLFAMILY, clinging together stoically. Helga looks at her briefly, and hereyes are infinitely sad.Rose sees a young mother next to her, clutching her five year old son, whois crying in terror. Shhh. Don't cry. It'll be over soon, darling. It'll all be over soon. He shall wipe every tear from their eyes. And there shall be no more deathor mourning, crying out or pain, for the former world has passed away.  As the ship tilts further everything not bolted down inside shifts.263 CUPBOARDS burst open in the pantry showering the floor with tons ofchina. A PIANO slides across the floor, crashing into a wall. FURNITUREtumbles across the Smoking Room floor.264 ON THE A-DECK PROMENADE passengers lose their grip and slide down thewooden deck like a bobsled run, hundreds of feet before they hit the water.TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, slips as she struggles along the railing andslides away screaming.265 AT THE STERN the propellers are 100 feet out of the water and rising.Panicking people leap from the poop deck rail, fall screaming and hit thewater like mortar rounds. A man falls from the poop deck, hitting thebronze hub of the starboard propeller with a sickening smack.266 SWIMMERS LOOK UP and see the stern towering over them like a monolith,the propellers rising against the stars. 110 feet. 120.267 AT THE STERN RAIL a man jumps. IN HIS POV we fall seemingly forever,right past one of the giant screws. The water rushes up--  268 TRACKING SLOWLY IN on Ruth as the sounds of the dying ship and thescreaming people come across the water.269 REVERSE / HER POV: IN A WIDE SHOT we see the spectacle of the Titanic,her lights blazing, reflecting in the still water. Its stern is high in theair, angles up over forty five degrees. The propellers are 150 feet out ofthe water. Over a thousand passengers cling to the decks, looking from adistance like a swarm of bees.The image is shocking, unbelieveable, unthinkable. Ruth stares at thespectacle, unable to frame it or put it into any proportion. God Almighty.The great liner's lights flicker.  In darkness Chief Engineer Bell hangs onto a pipe at the master brakerpanel. Around him men climb through tilted cyclopean mahcines with electrichand-torches. It is a black hell of breaking pipes, spraying water, andgroaning machinery threatening to tear right out of its bedplates.Water sprays down, hitting the breaker panel, but Bell will not leave hispost. CLUNK. The breakers kick. He slams them in again and-- WHOOM! a blastof light! Something melts and arcing fills the engine room with nightmarishlight--  WIDE SHOT. The lights go out all over the ship. Titanic becomes a vastblack silhouette against the stars.IN COLLAPSIBLE C: BRUCE ISMAY has his back to the ship, unable to watch thegreat steamer die. He is catatonic with remorse, his mind overloaded. Hecan avert his eyes, but he can't block out the sounds of dying people andmachinery.A loud CRACKING REPORT comes across the water.  Near the third funnel a man clutches the ship's rail. He stares down as theDECK SPLITS right between his feet. A yawning chasm opens with a THUNDER ofbreaking steelLOVEJOY is clutching the railing on the roof of the Officers' Mess. Hewatches in horror as the ship's structure RIPS APART right in front of him.He gapes down into a widening maw, seeing straight down into the bowels ofthe ship, amid a BOOMING CONCUSSION like the sound of artillery. Peoplefalling into the widening crevasse look like dolls.The stay cables on the funnel part and snap across the decks like whips,ripping off davits and ventilators. A man is hit by a whipping cable andsnatched OUT OF FRAME. Another cable smashes the rail next to Lovejoy andit rips free. He falls backward into the pit of jagged metal.Fires, explosions and sparks light the yawning chasm as the hull splitsdown through nine decks to the keel. The sea pours into the gaping wound--  It is a thundering black hell. Men scream as monstrous machinery comesapart around them, steel frames twisting like taffy. Their torchesilluminate the roaring, foaming demon of water as it races at the throughthe manchines. Trying to climb they are overtaken in seconds.  The STERN ALF of the ship, almost four hundred feet long, falls back towardthe water. On the poop deck everyone screams as they feel themselvesplummeting. The sound goes up like the roar of fans at a baseball stadiumwhen a run is scored.Swimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek asthey see the keel coming down on them like God's bootheel. The massivestern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea andpushing out a mighty wave of displaced water.Jack and Rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail. They feel the shipseemingly RIGHT ITSELF. Some of those praying think it is salvation. We're saved!Jack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly.Now the horrible mechanics play out. Pulled down by the awesome weight ofthe flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly. They feel the RUSH OFASCENT as the fantail angles up again. Everyone is clinging to benches,railings, ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts.The stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty.People start to fall, sliding and tumbling. They skid down the deck,screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting. They wrench other peopleloose and pull them down as well. There is a pile-up of bodies at theforward rail. The DAHL FAMILY falls one by one. We have to move!He climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She is terrifiedto move. He grabs her hand. Come on! I've got you!Jack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled her over therail two nights earlier, going the other direction. She gets over just asthe railing is going HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips herfiercely.The stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolithstanding against the stars. It hangs there like that for a long grace note,its buoyancy stable.Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling seaat the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over,hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fallone by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some ofthem bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators.Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull,gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet arethe gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern.Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them.Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull,holding onto the railing. It is a surreal moment.                            (nodding a greeting)Helluva night.The final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods. Lookingdown a hundred feet to the water, we drop like an elevator with Jack andRose.                               (talking fast)Take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. The shipwill suck us down. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Don't let go ofmy hand. We're gonna make it Rose. Trust me.She stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder. I trust you.Below them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers speed... theboiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the lastthirty feet.278 IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The nameTITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under thewater.Where the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black ocean.  Bodies are whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others strugglingspasmodically, as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them.280 Jack rises INTO FRAME F.G. kicking hard for the surface... holdingtightly to Rose, pulling her up.281 AT THE SURFACE: a roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people. Over athousand people are now floating where the ship went down. Some arestunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying, praying, moaning,shouting... screaming.Jack and Rose surface among them. They barely have time to gasp for airbefore people are clawing at them. People driven insane by the water, 4degrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable formdeath by fire.A man pushes Rose under, trying to climb on top of her... senselesslytrying to get out of the water, to climb onto anything. Jack PUNCHES himrepeatedly, pulling her free. Swim, Rose! SWIM!She tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of herlifejacket. They break out of the clot of people. He has to find some kindof flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water. Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it.All about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... achorus of tormented souls. And beyond that... nothing but black waterstretching to the horizon. The sense of isolation and hopelessness isoverwhelming.   Jack strokes rhythmically, the effort keeping him from freezing. Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything. It's so cold. I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.His words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them.Rose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath. She turnsand... SCREAMS.A DEVIL is right in from of her face. It is the black FRENCH BULLDOG,swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyesbugging. It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland.Beyond it Rose sees somehting in the water. What's that?Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is apiece of wooden debris, intricately carved. He pushes her up and sheslithers onto it belly down.But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges,almost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big enough to support her. Heclings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as besthe can.Their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion. AMAN swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris. Jack warns himback. It's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under. Let me try at least, or I'll die soon. You'll die quicker if you come any closer. Yes, I see. Good luck to you then.                              (swimming off)God bless.  The boat is overloaded and half-flooded. Men cling to the sides in thewater. Others, swimming, are drawn to it as their only hope. Cal, standingin the boat, slaps his oar in the water as a warning. Stay back! Keep off!Fabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to the boat. CalCLUBS HIM with the oar, cutting open his scalp. You don't... understand... I have... to get... to America.                           (pointing with the oar)It's that way!CLOSE ON FABRIZIO as he floats, panting each breath agony. You see thespirit leave him.FABRIZIO'S POV: Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and wielding the oar. A demonin a tuxedo. The image fades to black.  JACK AND ROSE still float amid a chorus of hte damned. Jack sees the ship'sofficer nearby, CHIEF OFFICER WILDE. He is blowing his whistle furiously,knowing the sound will carry over the water for miles. The boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. Theyhad to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back.She nods, his words helping her. She is shivering uncontrollably, her lipsblue and her teeth chattering. Thank God for you Jack.People are still screaming, calling to the lifeboats. Come back! Please! We know you can hear us. For God's sake! Please... help us. Save one life! SAVE ON LIFE!  IN BOAT 6: Ruth has her ears covered against the wailing in the darkness.The first class women in the boat sit, stunned, listening to the sounds ofhundreds screaming. They'll pull us right down I tell ya! Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.                              (nobody moves)Well come on!The women won't meet her eyes. They huddle into their ermine wraps. I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your menback there! We got plenty a' room for more. If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!Ruth keeps her ears covered and her eyes closed, shutting it all out.287 IN BOAT ONE: Sir Cosmo and Lucile Duff-Gordon sit with ten other peoplein a boat that is two thirds empty. They are two hundred yards from thescreaming in the darkness. We should do something.Lucile squeezes Cosmo's hand and pleads him with her eyes. She isterrified. It's out of the question.The crewmembers, intimidated by a nobleman, acquiesce. They hunch guiltily,hoping the sound will stop soon.TWENTY BOATS, most half full, float in the darkness. None of them make amove.  Jack and Rose drift under the blazing stars. The water is glassy, with onlythe faintest undulating swell. Rose can actually see the stars reflectingon the black mirror of the sea.Jack squeezes the water out of her long coat, tucking it in tightly aroundher legs. He rubs her arms. His face is chalk with in the darkness. A lowMOANING in the darknes around them. It's getting quiet. Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boatsorganized...Rose is unmoving, just staring into space. She knows the truth. There won'tbe any boats. Behind Jack she sees that Officer Wilde has stopped moving.He is slumped in his lifejacket, looking almost asleep. He has died ofexposure already. I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter tothe White Star Line about all this.She laughs weakly, but it sounds like a gasp of fear. Rose finds his eyesin the dim light. I love you Jack.He takes her hand. No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it. I'm so cold. You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're goingto make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady,warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me? I can't feel my body. Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing thatever happened to me.Jack is having trouble getting the breath to speak. It brought me to you. And I'm thankful, Rose. I'm thankful.His voice is trembling with the cold which is working tis way to his heart.But his eyes are unwavering. You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you willnever give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless...promise me now, and never let go of that promise. I promise. Never let go. I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.She grips his hand and they lie with their heads together. It is quiet now,except for the lapping of the water.  Fifth Officer Lowe, the impetuous young Welshman, has gotten Boats 10, 12and Collapsible D together with his own Boat 14. A demon of energy, he'shad everyone hold the boats together and is transferring passengers from 14into the others, to empty his boat for a rescue attempt.As the women step gingerly across the other boats, Lowe sees a shawledfigure in too much of a hurry. He rips the shawl off, and finds himselfstaring into the face of a man. He angrily shoves the stowaway into anotherboat and turns to his crew of three. Right, man the oars.  The beam of an electric torch plays across the water like a searchlight asboat 14 comes toward us.ANGLE FROM THE BOAT as the torch illuminates floating debris, a poignanttrail of flotsam: a violin, a child's wooden soldier, a framed photo of asteerage family. Daniel Marvin's wooden Biograph camera.Then, their white lifebelts bobbing in the darkness like signoposts, thefirst bodies come into the torch's beam. The people are dead but notdrowned, killed by the freezing water. Some look like they could besleeping. Others stare with frozen eyes at the stars.Soon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row. They hit the oars on theheads of floating men and women... a wooden thunk. One seaman throws up.Lowe sees a mother floating with her arms frozen around her lifeless baby.                       (the worst moment of his life)We waited too long.  IN A HOVERING DOWNANGLE we see Jack and Rose floating in the black water.The stars reflect in the mill pond surface, and the two of them seem to befloating in interstellar space. They are absolutely still. Their hands arelocked together. Rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheelingabove her. The music is transparent, floating... as the long sleep stealsover Rose, and she feels peace.CLOSE ON Rose's face. Pale, like the faces of the dead. She seems to befloating in a void. Rose is in a semi-hallucinatory state. She knows she isdying. Her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of Jack's song: ""Come Josephine in my flying machine...""ROSE'S POV: The stars. Like you've never seen them. The Milky Way aglorious band from horizon to horizon.A SHOOTING STAR flares... a line of light across the heavens.TIGHT ON ROSE again. We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals.Her breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. Her eyes track downfrom the stars to the water.ROSE'S POV... SLOW MOTION: The silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars.She sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water,leaving weightless pearls floating in the air. The VOICES of the men soundslow and DISTORTED.Then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares acrossthe water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between. It flicks past hermotionless form and moves on. The boat is 50 feet away, and moving pasther. The men look away.Rose lifts her head to turn to Jack. We see that her hair has frozen to thewood under her.                              (barely audible)Jack.She touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rosegently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost.He seems to be sleeping peacefully.But he is not asleep.Rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her. Oh, Jack.All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is furtheraway now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go.She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reasonto even try.And then... her eyes snap open.She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off thewood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boatis invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She strugglesto draw breath, calling again.292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to somethingahead, turning the tiller.293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen toJack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclaspstheir hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film. I won't let go. I promise.She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade outlike a spirit returning to some immaterial plane.Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. Sheswims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts toBLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps acrossthe still water.294 IN BOAT 14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle.                            (turning the tiller)Row back! That way! Pull!Rose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her. She is still blowing when Lowetakes the whistle from her mouth as they haul her into the boat. She slipsinto uncosciousness and they scramble to cover her with blankets...  EXTREME CLOSEUP of Rose's ancient, wrinkled face. Present day. Fifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us.There were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back. One. Sixwere saved from the water, myself included. Six out of fifteen hundred.As she speaks THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly across the faces of Lizzy and thesalvage crew on KELDYSH. Lovett, Bodine, Buell, the others... the realityof what happened here 84 years before has hit them like never before. Withher story Rose has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the firsttime, they do feel like graverobbers.Lovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about the diamond. Afterward, the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do butwaith... wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which wouldnever come.  MATCHING MOVE as the camera tracks along the faces of the saved.DISSOLVE TO: ANOTHER BOAT, and then ANOTHER, seeing faces we know among thesurvivors: Ismay in a trance, just staring and trembling... Cal, sippingfrom a hip flask offered to him by a black-faced stoker... Ruth huggingherself, rocking gently.IN BOAT 14: CLOSE ON ROSE, lying swaddled. Only her face is visile, whiteas the moon. The man next to her jumps up, pointing and yelling. Sooneveryone is looking and shouting excitedly. In Rose's POV it is all silent, IN SLOW-MOTION SILENCE we see Lowe light a green flare and wave it aseveryone shouts and cheers. Rose doesn't react. She floats beyond all humanemotion.  Golden lgiht washes across the white boats, which gloat in a calm seareflecting the rosy sky. All around them, like a flotilla of sailing ships,are icebergs. The CARPATHIA sits nearby, as boats row toward her.  IMAGES DISSOLVE into one another: a ship's hull looming, with the lettersCARPATHIA visible on the bow... Rose watching, rocked by the sea, her faceblank... seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to the Carpathia'sgangway doors... two women crying and hugging each other inside the ship...ALL SILENT, ALL IN SLOW-MOTION. There is just music, so gentle and sad,part elegy, part hymn, part aching song of love lost forever.THE IMAGES CONTINUE to music... Rose, outside of time, outside of herself,coming into Carpathia, barely able to stand... Rose being draped wtih warmblankets and given hot tea... BRUCE ISMAY climbing aboard. He has the faceand eyes of a damned soul.As Ismay walks along the hall, guided by a crewman toward the doctor'scabin, he passes rows of seated and standing widows. He must run thegauntlet of their accusing gazes.  It is the afternoon of the 15th. Cal is searching the faces of the widowslining the deck, looking for Rose. The deck of Carpathia is crammed withhuddled people, and even the recovered lifeboats of Titanic. On a hatchcover sits an enormous pile of lifebelts.He keeps walking toward the stern. Seeing Cal's tuxedo, a stewardapproaches him. You won't find any of your people back here, sir. It's all steerage.Cal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group, looking under shawlsand blankets at one bleak face after another.Rose is sipping hot tea. Her eyes focus on him as he approaches her. Hebarely recognizes her. She looks like a refugee, her matted hair hanging inher eyes. Yes, I lived. How awkward for you. Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you--She holds up her hand, stopping him. Please don't. Don't talk. Just listen. We will make a deal, since that issomething you understand. From this moment you do not exist for me, nor Ifor you. You shall not see me again. And you will not attempt to find me.In return I will keep my silence. Your actions last night need never cometo light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased.She fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed theirlives. Is this in any way unclear?                             (after a long beat)What do I tell your mother? Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.She stands, turning to the rail. Dismissing him. We see Cal stricken withemotion. You're precious to me, Rose. Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.We see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly love her.After a moment, he turns and walks away. That was the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inheritedhis millions. The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistolin his mouth that year. His children fought over the scraps of his estatelike hyenas, or so I read.301 ANGLE ON ROSE, at the railing of the Carpathia, 9pm April 18th. Shegazes up at the Statue of Liberty, looking just as it does today, welcomingher home with her glowing torch. It is just as Fabrizio saw it, so clearly,in his mind.302 LATER CARPATHIA DISCORGES THE SURVIVORS at the Cunard pier, Pier 54.Over 30,000 people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets. Themagnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting anamazing tableau.Several hundred police keep the mob back. The dock is packes with friendsand reletives, officials, ambulances, and the press--Reporters and photographers swarm everywhere... 6 deep at the foot of thegangways, lining the tops of cars and trucks... it is the 1912 equicalentof a media circus. They jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging onthem as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions.Rose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steeragepassengers. Immigration officers are asking them questions as they come offthe gangway. Name? Dawson. Rose Dawson.The officer steers her toward a holding area for processing. Rose walksforward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of photographer's magnesiumflashes cause them to flinch, and the glare is blinding. There is a suddendisturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running toembrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. Thereporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode.Rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes through thejostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in theconfusion. Can you exchange one life for another? A caterpillar turns into abutterfly. If a mindless insect can do it, why couldn't I? Was it any moreunimaginable than the sinking of the Titanic?TRACKING WITH HER as she walks away, further and further until she flashesand the roar are far behind her, and shi is till walking, determined.  Old Rose sits with the group in the Imaging Shack, lit by the blue glow ofthe screens. She holds the haircomb with the jade butterfly on the handlein her gnarled hands. We never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all. No, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him until now,not to anyone.                                (to Lizzy)Not even your grandfather. A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. Butnow you all know there was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me,in every way that a person can be saved.                            (closing her eyes)I don't even have a picture of him. He exists now only in my memory.   The Mir submersibles make their last pass over the ship. We hear Yuri thepilot on the UQC: Mir One returning to surface.The sub rises off the deck of the wreck, taking its light with it, leavingthe Titanic once again it its fine and private darkness.  A desultory wrap party for the expedition is in progress. There is musicand some of the (co-ed) Russian crew are dancing. Bodine is getting drunkin the aggressive style of Baker Joughin.Lovett stands at the rail, looking down into the black water. Lizzy comesto him, offering him a beer. She puts her hand on his arm. I'm sorry. We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.Lovett notices a figure move through the lights far down at the stern ofthe ship. Oh shit.  Rose walks through the shadows of the deck machinery. Her nightgown blowsin the wind. Her feet are bare. Her hands are clutched at her chest, almostas if she is praying.ON LOVETT AND LIZZY running down the stairs from the top deck, hauling ass.ROSE reaches the sern rail. Her gnarled fingers wrap over the rail. Herancient foot steps up on the gunwale. She pushes herself up, leaningforward. Over her shoulder, we see the black water glinting far below.LOVETT AND LIZZY run up behind her. Grandma, wait!! Don't--ROSE TURNS her head, looking at them. She turns further, and we see she hassomething in her hand, something she was about to drop overboard.It is the ""Heart of the Ocean"".Lovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide. Rose keeps itover the railing where she can drop it anytime. Don't come any closer. You had it the entire time?!FLASH CUT TO: A SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE walking away from Pier 54. Thephotographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her. She has her handsin her pockets. She stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace.She stares at it in amazement.BACK ON KELDYSH, Rose smiles at Brock's incomprehension. The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time Ithough of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by withouthis help.She holds it out over the water. Bodine and a couple of the other guys comeup behind Lovett, reacting to what is in Rose's hand. Holy shit. Don't drop it Rose.                             (a fierce whisper)Rush her.                                 (to Bodine)It's hers, you schmuck.                                 (to her)Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump offthe Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is...we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think aboutthis a second. I have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs.The massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds out his hand... Just let me hold it in my hand, Rose. Please. Just once.He comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly moving up to herat the stern of Titanic.Surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand,while still holding onto the necklace. Lovett gazes at the object of hisquest. An infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. It ismesmerizing. It fits in his hand just like he imagined. My God.His grip tightens on the diamond.He looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise anddeep. You look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life ispriceless, and making each day count.His fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips the diamond outof his hand. He feels it sliding away.Then, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace over the rail.Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hitthe water and disappear forever. Aww!! That really sucks, lady!Brock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction... HELAUGHS. He laughs until the tears come to his eyes. Then he turns to Lizzy. Would you like to dance?Lizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at the stars.308 IN THE BLACK HEART OF THE OCEAN, the diamond sinks, twinkling end overend, into the infinate depths.  A GRACEFUL PAN across Rose's shelf of carefully arranged pictures:Rose as a young actress in California, radiant... a theatrically lit studiopublicity shot... Rose and her husband, with their two children... Rosewith her son at his college graduation... Rose with her children andgrandchildren at her 70th birthday. A collage of images of a life livedwell.THE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame. Rose, circa 1920. She is at thebeach, sitting on a horse at the surfline. The Santa Monica pier, with itsrollercoaster is behind her. She is grinning, full of life.We PAN OFF the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her bunk. A profileshot. She is very still. She could be sleeping, or maybe something else.  310 THE WRECK OF TITANIC looms like a ghost out of the dark. It is lit by akind of moonlight, a light of the mind. We pass over the endless forecastledeck to the superstructure, moving faster than subs can move... almost likewe are flying.WE GO INSIDE, and the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard. Therust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it istransformed... WE EMERGE onto the grand staircase, lit by glowingchandelier. The music is vibrant now, and the room is populated by men intie and tails, women in gowns. It is exquisitely beautiful.IN POV we sweep down the staircase. The crowd of beautiful gentlmen andladies turn as we descend toward them. At the bottom a man stands with hisback to us... he turns and it is Jack. Smiling he holds his hand out towardus.IN A SIDE ANGLE Rose goes into his arms, a girl of 17. The passengers,officers and crew of the RMS Titanic smile and applaud in the utter silenceof the abyss.

Maids pull dustsheets          off furniture; servants open shutters. Sunshine spills          into the great rooms of Netherfield. outside, a glimpse          of rolling parkland.           ""It is a truth universally          acknowledged...          Its a whirlwind of activity. Servants bustle around,          sweeping and polishing, readying the house for its new          occupants.

""that a single man in possession of a          good fortune, must be in want of a wife""          A white sheet is pulled from a spinet and obscures our          vision.            Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly          nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow          grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First          Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down          17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth          jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a          wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early          childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where,          through an open window to the library, we see her mother          and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet.           My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that          Netherfield Park is let at last?          We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear          her parents' conversation.           Do you not want to know who has taken it?           As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have          any choice in the matter...                                                                                                                As Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound          of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks          down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the          bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds          Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the          precocious baby of the family, are listening at the door          to the library.            Have you heard? A Mr Bingley, a young man          from the North of England, has come down          on Monday in a chaise and four.           With five thousand a year!          Jane, (the eldest, most beautiful and most charmingly          naive of the girls), joins them at the door.           Goodness!           - and he's single to be sure!           Mr Bennet is trying to ignore Mrs Bennet.           What a fine thing for our girls!           Bow can it affect them?           My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so          tiresome! You know that he must marry one          of them.           Oh, so that is his design in settling          here?          Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of          the library into the corridor where the girls are          gathered, Mrs Bennet following.           Mr Bennet walks through the girls to the drawing room          pursued by Mrs Bennet.                                                                                                                - So you must go and visit him at once.           Mr Bennet walks to the bookshelf to replace the book he          is carrying. Mary is there practising the piano. The          girls come in to listen.           Oh, yes, Papa.           Please, Papa!           There is no need, for I already have.          The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare.           You have?           when?           • How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have          no compassion for my poor nerves?           You mistake me, my dear. I have a high          respect for them; they are my constant          companions these twenty years.           Is he amiable?           Is he handsome?           He's sure to be handsome.            With five thousand a year, it would not          matter if he had a big pink face.           I will give my hearty consent to his          marrying whichever of the girls he          chooses.           So will he come to the ball tomorrow?                                                                                                                I believe so.          Lydia and Kitty shriek with excitement.            I have to have your spotted muslin,          please!           I need it!           - if you do, I'll lend you my green          slippers.          Mr Bennet winks at Elizabeth and turns to Mary, a          serious, somewhat pedantic young woman.           And what do you say, Mary? Are you not          excited by the prospect of a ball?           Society has claims on us all, Papa. As          long as I have my mornings to myself, I          consider an interval of recreation and          • amusement as quite desirable.          Elizabeth laughs.           The local subscription dance is in full swing. It's a          rough-and-ready, though enthusiastic affair...yeoman          farmers, small-time squires with their ruddy-cheeked          daughters.          Lydia and Kitty, with their mother, are fussing over          their clothes - straightening their dresses, tidying          their hair and so on.           (fussing over her dress)          I literally can't breathe its so tight.           My toes hurt.          Elizabeth and Jane are a little apart from their family.          Jane looks breathtaking.                                                                                                                 • Well, if every man in this room does not          end the evening completely in love with          you then I am no judge of beauty.           Or men.           Oh, they are far too easy to judge.           They are not all bad.           Humourless poppycocks, in my limited          experience.           One of these days, Lizzie, someone will          catch your eye and then you'll have to          watch your tongue.           And eat my hat.          She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters           the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but          • prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get          the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of          every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most          company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam          Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which          could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the          highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches          Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised          shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.           Luckily, you are not wearing a hat.          A hush falls as the local people turn to stare. The          newcomers - creatures from another world - make quite a          stir.           Caroline Bingley, standing next to Darcy, gazes at the          somewhat provincial gathering with distaste.           We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,          are we not, Mr Darcy?          He does indeed look superior to the assembled company. On          the dance floor a young couple, staring at the newcomers,          trip over each other, stumble and burst out laughing.                                                                                                               Mr Bingley spots Jane Bennet. For a moment he forgets          himself and openly looks at her.           I find it very charming.            My brother is so easily pleased, is he          not?          Darcy does not answer.           Elizabeth has found her great friend Charlotte Lucas - an          intelligent, sensible woman in her late twenties. They          spy through the crowd.           So which of the painted peacocks is our          Mr Bingley?           He is on the right, and on the left is          his sister.           And the person with the disagreeable          expression?           That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.           Poor soul.           On the contrary, he has ten thousand a          year and owns half of Derbyshire.           Sir William Lucas, 53 a hale but unsophisticated member          of the self-made gentry, takes it upon himself to          introduce Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy to his daughter          Charlotte and the Bennet family.           (to Mr Bingley)          My eldest daughter you know, Mrs          Bennet ...miss Jane Bennet, Elizabeth and          Miss Mary Bennet.           It is a pleasure. I have two others but           they are already dancing.                                                                                                                Delighted to make your acquaintance.            And may I introduce Mr Darcy.           -- of Pemberley, in Derbyshire!          A stiff bow from Darcy, Elizabeth smiles, Darcy does not.           Moments later. Elizabeth is standing in a small group          with Jane, Bingley, Miss Bingley and Darcy. Bingley can't          keep his eyes off Jane, but is frightfully at a loss in          disguising his instant ardour.           How do you like it here in Hertfordshire,          Mr Bingley?           (smiling at Jane shyly)          Very much.           The library at Netherfield, I've heard,          is one of the finest in the country.            Yes, it fills me with guilt.          He looks at Jane a little blush starts around his collar.           Not a good reader, you see. I like being          out of doors. I mean, I can read, of           His sister steps in. as the blush threatens to engulf his          ears.            Your library at Pemberly, Mr Darcy, is          astonishingly good.           Thank you. It is the work of many          generations.           And then you have added so much to it          yourself.                                                                                                                 I wish I read more, but there always          seems so many other things to do.           That's exactly what I meant.          He beams at Jane.           Mr and Mrs Bennet stand a little apart from Elizabeth and          the other young people. Lydia and Kitty bound up to them          in a state of high excitement.           Mama! The regiment is arriving next week!           And will be here for the whole winter!          Mrs Forster told us!           They're going to be stationed in the          village!           Mr Bingley'turns to Jane.           May I have the honour?          They leave, to dance.           Do you dance Mr Darcy?           Not if I can help it.          Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as          they over hear the following...            officers! Lots of officers!           How will we meet them?           It's easy. You just walk up and down in          front of them and drop something.          Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty.                                                                                                                • They pick it up. You say 'oh thank you          sir' and blush prettily and then you're          introduced!           I have long suspected that we have two of          the silliest girls in the county.           Oh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I          liked a red coat myself, and if a smart          young colonel with six thousand a year          should want one of my girls I shall not          say nay to him.          Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie          moves away.           The dance floor. Mr Bingley is dancing with Jane. His          ears blushing with thrilled embarrassment. Mrs Bennet,          with a group of other mothers, watches the young couple          with rather too obvious satisfaction.           7 That dress becomes her, does it not. 7          • Though of course my Jane needs little          help from couturiers.          Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at          Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and          demure, he clearly smitten -           Darcy is joined by Bingley exhilarated by the dance.           Come Darcy, I must have you dance. I hate          to see you standing by yourself in this          stupid manner.           (shakes his head)          You know how I detest it.           Upon my word, I've never seen so many          pretty girls in my life.           You are dancing with the only handsome          girl in the room.                                                                                                                 Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I          ever beheld, but her sister Elizabeth is          very agreeable.          They have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have          not seen Elizabeth and charlotte who are standing close          behind them. Elizabeth smirks as she overhears their          conversation.           Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not          handsome enough to tempt me.          Elizabeth's smile drops.           You had better return to your partner and          enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting          your time with me.          Bingley goes off.           Elizabeth and Charlotte, who have overheard Darcy and          Bingley's exchange.           Ignore him, Lizzie, he is such a          disagreeable man it would be a misfortune          to be liked by him.           Don't worry. I would not dance with him          for half of Derbyshire.           Later. Bingley politely dancing with Charlotte. As he          does so, he catches sight of Jane dancing with somebody          else. A look of pure longing, but he cannot dance every          dance with her. Lizzie too is dancing and clocks this.          Lydia and Kitty are exuberantly dancing too, laughing and          chatting. Darcy stands watching, a look of infinitely          superior boredom on his fine features.           Bingley is standing with Jane, Elizabeth, Mrs Bennet and          Darcy.            Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing          young woman.                                                                                                                • Yes! I adore her.           It is a pity she is not more handsome.           Mama!           But Lizzie will never admit she is plain.           Of course it's my Jane who's considered          the beauty of the county.           Oh, Mama, please!           When she was only fifteen there was a          gentleman so much in love with her that I          was sure he would make her an offer.          However, he did write her some very          pretty verses.            And so ended their affection. I wonder          • who first discovered the power of poetry          in driving away love?           I thought that poetry was the food of          love.           Of a fine, stout love it may. Everything          nourishes what is strong already. But if          it is only a thin, slight sort of          inclination, I'm convinced that one good          sonnet will starve it away entirely.          Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of          interest.           So what do you recommend, to encourage          affection?           Oh dancing, of course. Even if ones          partner is barely tolerable.          She gives him a dazzling smile. Darcy looks startled. He          has no idea she heard him. He blushes.                                                                                                                 Elizabeth is dancing happily in a round, Jane and Bingley          • are also in the same dance. At the edge of the dance          floor Darcy is watching.           Elizabeth and Jane are both tucked up in the same bed,          but are too excited to sleep.           Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought          to be. Sensible, good humoured -           (completing the list)          Handsome, conveniently rich -           You know perfectly well I do not believe          marriage should be driven by thoughts of          money.           I agree entirely, only the deepest love          will persuade me into matrimony, which is          why I will end up an old maid.           Do you really believe he liked me,          Lizzie?           Jane, he danced with you most of the          night.           I was flattered, I must admit. I did not          expect such a compliment.           That is one great difference between us.          Compliments always take you by surprise.          Well, Mr Bingley is certainly very          amiable, and I give you leave to like          him. You've liked many a stupider person.           Lizzie!           You're a great deal too apt to like          people in general, you know. All the          world is good and agreeable in your eyes.                                                                                                                 Not his friend. I still cannot believe          what he said about you.           Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive          his vanity had he not wounded mine. But          no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak          again.          She blows out the candle.           Mrs Bennet presides over breakfast with an endless          description of the ball. Mary is doing some needle work,          whilst Lydia, Kitty and Jane blearily eat.           And then he danced the third with Miss          Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is          not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss          King of little standing. And the fifth          again with Jane.           • If he'd had any compassion for me he          would have sprained his ankle in the          first dance.           Oh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the          girls looked forward to a grand          inheritance.          Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this          speech many times before.            Kitty, be so kind as to pass the butter.           As you well know, Mr Bennet, when you          die, which may in fact be very soon, our          girls will be left without a roof over          their head nor a penny to their name.           Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the          morning.          Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's          • babbling.                                                                                                                • A letter addressed to Miss Bennet, Ma'arn.          From Netherfield Hall.           Praise the Lord! We are saved.          Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane.           Make haste, Jane, make haste. 0 happy          day!           It is from Miss Bingley.          Mrs Bennet is stopped in her tracks.           She has invited me to dine with her.           Her brother will be dining out.           This is most unfortunate.           I didn't think he was so good looking          anyway.           Can I take the carriage?           Certainly not my dear, you will go to          Netherfield on horse back.           Horseback?!          Mrs Bennet leaves with a secret smile on her lips.           Jane rides through the countryside, A distant rumble of          thunder. She looks up...           An open book. Plop plop! Raindrops fall on it. Drawing          back, we see Lizzie walking through a field, reading. She          looks up to the sky...                                                                                                                  Mrs Bennet stands at the kitchen door. A boy is          delivering meat. It starts to rain. She puts out her          hand, to check.           (smiles, satisfied)          Ah, good...          The housekeeper, Mrs Hill, who is with her, looks bemused          at her mistress's reaction.           A louder rumble of thunder. A washerwoman hastily pulls          clothes from a line...it's bucketing down heavily now...           In the local.village people run for cover; shopkeepers          cover up their wares...           Mr and Mrs Bennet look out at the pouring rain.           Excellent. Now she will have to stay the          night. Exactly as I predicted.           Good grief, woman. Your skills in the art          of match-making are without question.           Though I don't think, mama, you can          reasonably take credit for making it          rain. Let's hope she hasn't caught her          death before she gets there.            A footman opens the great doors to find Jane standing           there soaked. she sneezes.           • Elizabeth reads a letter.                                                                                                                • ""And my kind friends will not hear of me          returning home until I am better -- but do          not be alarmed excepting a sore throat, a.          fever, and a headache there is nothing          wrong with me."" This is ridiculous.           Well, my dear, if your daughter does die          it will be a comfort to know it was all          in pursuit of Mr Bingley.           People do not die of colds.           Though she might well perish with the          shame of having such a mother.          Mr Bennet laughs.           I am going to Netherfield at once.           Nonsense, the horse is with Jane. And the          girls took the carriage to town.           Then I will walk there. We should not          leave Jane alone in her condition.           Walk! You will not be fit to be seen by          the time you get there.           Why the devil not. We could have them all          laid up at Netherfield Hall.           I will be fit for Jane which is all I          care about.           Elizabeth strides across vast muddy fields, slipping as          she goes. Netherfield is in view on the horizon. She          stops to take it in, then carries on down an even more          muddy track.            In the large grand dining room Caroline Bingley and Darcy          are eating breakfast.                                                                                                               Its very formal, in fact frigid, compared to the          volatile Bennet household. Darcy is reading the          • newspaper; Caroline Bingley is reading a letter.           (puts down the letter)          Apparently, Lady Bathurst is redecorating          her ballroom in the French style. A          little unpatriotic, don't you think?          Mr Darcy is about to answer when the door opens. A          footman appears, his face rigid with disapproval.           Miss Elizabeth Bennet.          Lizzie comes in, her face flushed, her skirt covered in          mud. She looks ravishing. Darcy stares at her, then          quickly rises to his feet. Caroline Bingley, astonished,          looks her up and down.           Good Lord, Miss Bennet. Have you walked          here?           I'm so sorry. How is my sister?            She's upstairs.           Show Miss Bennet the way, Alfred.          Lizzie leaves. A beat.           Goodness, did you see her petticoat? Six          inches deep in mud!          No response.           And her hair, so blowsy and untidy!           I think her concern for her sister does          her credit.          A little pause, Caroline recovers.           Oh yes, its shocking to have a bad cold.          I dislike excessively being ill myself.                                                                                                                 Elizabeth is taken upstairs. Bingley, looking tense,          waits outside her sister's room. His face lights up when          he sees her.           Miss Elizabeth! Oh I'm so glad to see you          A doctor comes out of Jane's room.            How is she?           A violent cold, but we shall get the          better of it.           Elizabeth goes into the bedroom where Jane lies in bed,          feverish and ill.           Jane!          Jane's face lights up. Elizabeth kisses her.           Lizzie! Oh, your face is so cold. They're          being so kind to me, I feel such a          terrible imposition.           Don't worry. I don't know who is more          pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr          Bingley.          Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor.           Thank you for tending to my sister so          diligently, it seems she is in better          comfort here than she would be at home.           It is a pleasure, I mean not to see her          so sick, of course, that's terrible. I          will have a room made up for you. You          must be our guest here until Jane          recovers.                                                                                                                  Darcy is quietly reading as Bingley paces about          anxiously. Caroline berates him from the sofa.           Stay!? She is a perfectly sweet girl but          save being an excellent walker, there is          very little to recommend her.           I thought she showed remarkable spirit          coming all this way.           The eldest Miss Bennet, as you know, I          hold in excessive regard and I wish her          well settled. Though I do fear with her          families low connections there is little          chance of it. Their uncle is in trade,          you know, in Cheapside.           If they had uncles enough to fill all          Cheapside it would not make them one jot          less agreeable.           Mr Bennet is overseeing the gardener who is pruning the          hedge. Mrs Bennet bustles up. She looks very pleased with          herself.           Well, my dear, its all going according          to plan. He's half in love with her          already!           (a touch disingenuously)          Who, my sweetest?           Mr Bingley! And he doesn't mind that she          hasn't a penny, for he has enough for the          two of them.          Suddenly a distant trumpet sounds, dogs bark. The militia          are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed          up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face          lights up.           Wait for me!                                                                                                               And she's gone. Mr Bennet gazes at their departing          • figures.           Mrs Bennet and her two daughters rush down the street          into the village. Dogs bark, children run alongside as a          regiment of soldiers march through the street. Geese          scatter; shopkeepers stand in their doorways. The two          Bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers. Mrs          Bennet, flushed and excited, runs panting behind them.          Lydia deliberately drops her hankerchief. One of the          soldiers stands on it. She is appalled.           Elizabeth is reading a book. Darcy is writing a letter.          Bingley is sat nervously. Caroline, obviously bored,          wanders the room looking for distraction. She looks over          Darcy's shoulder.           You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.           (without looking up)          • You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.          Caroline Bingley lingers, annoyingly.           How many letters you must have occasion          to write, Mr Darcy. Letters of business          too. How odious I should think them!           It is fortunate, then, that they fall to          my lot instead of yours.           Please tell your sister that I long to          see her.           I have already told her once, by your          desire.          Lizzie looks across from her book.           I do dote on her, I was quite in raptures          at her beautiful little design for a          table.                                                                                                                  Perhaps you will give me leave to defer          your raptures till I write again. At          present I have not enough room to do them          justice.          Mr Bingley now pacing anxiously around the room.           Its amazing, how young ladies have the          patience to be so accomplished.           What do you mean, Charles?           They all paint tables, and embroider          cushions and play the piano. I never          heard of a young lady, but people say she          is accomplished.           The word is indeed applied too liberally.          I cannot boast of knowing more than half          a dozen women, in all my acquaintance,          that are truely accomplished.           Nor I, to be sure!           Goodness! You must comprehend a great          deal in the idea.           I do.           Absolutely. She must have a thorough          knowledge of music, singing, drawing,          dancing and the modern languages, to          deserve the word. And something in her          air and manner of walking.           And of course she must improve her mind          by extensive reading.          Elizabeth closes her book.           i am no longer surprised at your knowing          only six accomplished women. I rather          wonder now at your knowing any.            Are you so severe on your own sex?                                                                                                                • I never saw such a woman. She would          certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.          Pause. Darcy goes back to his letter. Caroline Bingley          picks up a book. Pauses. Puts it down. she walks over to            Miss Bennet, let us take a turn about the          room.          Lizzie, surprised, gets up. Caroline Bingley links her          arm and they start walking up and down.           It's refreshing, is it not, after sitting          so long in one attitude?           And it's a small kind of accomplishment,          I suppose.          Darcy meets Lizzie's eye, briefly. He goes back to his          letter-writing. More walking up and down. Caroline          Bingley turns to Darcy.           Mr Darcy, will you join us?           (shakes his head)          You can only have two motives, Miss          Bingley, and I would interfere with          either.           (to Lizzie, archly)          What can he mean?           Our surest way of disappointing him will          be to ask nothing about it.            Please tell us!           Either you are in each other's confidence          and have secret affairs to discuss, or          you are conscious that your figures          appear to the greatest advantage by          walking. If the first, I should get in          your way. If the second, I can admire you          • much better from here.                                                                                                                Oh, shocking! How shall we punish him for          such a speech?           We could always tease him.           Oh no, Mr Darcy is not to be laughed at!           Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would          you consider that a fault?           That I couldn't say.           For we're trying to find a fault in you.           Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive          the follies and vices of others, or their          offences against myself. My good opinion,          once lost, is lost forever.           • Oh dear, I cannot tease you about that.          What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.            A family trait I think.          Elizabeth smiles, sweetly. Miss Bingley glances at Darcy.           Elizabeth wakes up next to Jane.           Darcy gallops through the countryside.           Darcy, exhausted, rides into the stable yard. In the          corner is a trough and pump. He strides up to the pump,          puts his head under it and douses himself with cold          water.                                                                                                                 From a window Elizabeth looks out at Darcy.          Darcy looks up and for a second catches Elizabeth looking          down at him. She turns from the window. Jane is waking          up.           Jane, do you think you might feel well          enough to leave today?           The doors open. The Butler as before:           A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet, a Miss          Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.           Are we to receive every Bennet in the          country?          Mrs Bennet, Lydia, Mary and Kitty are introduced to          Caroline, Bingley and Darcy. Elizabeth holds her breath          as her mother launches into untold gaucheries.           What an excellent room you have sir. Such          expensive furnishings. I hope you intend          to stay here, Mr Bingley.           Absolutely I find the country very          diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?           I find it perfectly adequate even if          society is a little less varied than in          town.           But I assure you there is quite as much          going on in the country as there is in          the town.           Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely          meant there were not such a variety of          people to be met in the country as there          are in town, which you must acknowledge          to be true.                                                                                                                 Nonsense, we dine with four and twenty          families. Sir William Lucas for instance          is a very agreeable man. So very genteel          and easy.          Elizabeth cringes.           Mr Bingley, is it true that you have          promised to hold a ball here at          Netherfield?           Well...           It would be an excellent way to meet new          friends. You could invite the militia.           Oh do hold a ball.           (trying to stop Bingley being           Kitty...           When your sister has recovered you shall          name the day.           I think a Ball is a perfectly irrational          way to gain new acquaintance. It would be          better if conversation instead of dancing          were the order of the day.           Indeed much more rational but rather less          like a ball.           Thank you, Mary.           (to Mrs Bennet)          Please let me show you to Jane, you will          find her quite recovered.                                                                                                                  The Bennet's carriage awaits. The Bingley's are gathered          to see the Bennet's off. Jane is radiant - in the peak of          health.           (to the Bingley's)          Really, I don't know how to thank you.          Bingley beams bashfully. He can't take his eyes off her.           Really, you're welcome anytime you feel          the least bit poorly.            Thank you for such stimulating company.          It has been most instructive.           Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.          Elizabeth looks at Darcy, who does not say anything. She          gets in the carriage.           Mr Darcy.           Miss Bennet.          They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the          Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley          waves enthusiastically to Jane.           Goodbye. Goodbye.           The family are all squeezed in rather too tightly.           What a high and mighty man that Mr Darcy          is, quite eaten up with pride.           The Bennet's carriage is stopped in its tracks by the          Militia who are marching en masse through town.                                                                                                                Lydia cannot believe her eyes as row after row of          soldiers pass by the carriage with not a few of the men          looking in at the Bennet girls with some interest.           I can't believe it, there must be a          thousand of them.          Leading the one troupe of Militia is Wickham a very          handsome blonde officer, Lydia spots him and swoons.           (to the coachman)          Please, drive on.           As the Bennet girls come into the house, Lydia eulogizing          the Militia, they meet Mr Bennet.           I hope, my dear, that you have ordered a          good dinner today, because I have reason          to expect an addition to our family           party.          Mr Bennet holds up the letter.           Collins, late twenties, an overweening sychophant,          nervous and unctuous in equal measure. He sits in his          black garb, hunched uncomfortably as he comes through          town.           ""Dear sir, the disagreement subsisting          between yourself and my late father over          the entail to me of the Longbourn estate,          has long been a subject of much torment          which I have frequently wished to heal.          Having received ordination this Easter          and being so fortunately distinguished by          the patronage of the Right Honorable Lady          Catherine de Bourgh...""          Collins' voice fades out as his carriage wipes through          frame revealing Elizabeth and Charlotte on their way to          the butchers.                                                                                                                 • His name is Mr Collins. He's the dreaded          cousin.           Who's to inherit?           Indeed. Everything, apparently. He may          leave us our stays, but even my piano          stool belongs to Mr Collins.           When?           He can turn us out of the house as soon          as he pleases.           But why?           Because the estate is entailed to him and          not to us poor females.          A cart passes, crammed with sheep going to slaughter.           Mr Collins is ushered in by the manservant, Perkins. He          looks around his future home with interest.          Mr and Mrs Bennet greet him.            Mr Collins, at your service.           What a charming house! So convenient for          the local village.          (looks at the furniture)          And some very fine pieces, if I'm not          mistaken.          A beat. This is hardly tactful.            They are.          Jane, Lizzie and Mary enter.           Ah, these are your daughters, are they          not?                                                                                                                We have some more somewhere.           I must congratulate you. I have heard          much of their beauty, but in this          instance fame has fallen short of the          truth.          A very low bow. The girls are somewhat taken aback.           The Bennets and Collins are seated formally for supper.          Mr Collins is served some food.           What a superbly featured room and what          excellent boiled potatoes. It is many          years since I had such an exemplary          vegetable. To which of my fair cousins          should I compliment the excellence of the          cooking?           Mr Collins, we are perfectly able to keep          a cook.            Excellent. I am very pleased the estate          affords such a living. I am honoured to          have, as my patroness, Lady Catherine de          Bourg, you have heard of her, I presume?          Mrs Bennet shakes her head.           My small rectory abuts her estate,          Rosings Park, and she often condescends          to drive by my humble abode in her little          phaeton and ponies.          A pause. Lizzie catches her father's eye.           Does she have any family?           One daughter, the heiress of Rosings and          very extensive property. I have often          observed to Lady Catherine, that her          daughter seemed born to be a duchess for          she has all the superior graces of          • elevated rank.                                                                                                                 MR COLLINS (cont'd)          .These are the kind of little delicate          compliments that are always acceptable to          1�1 ladies, and which I conceive myself          particularly bound to pay.            How happy for you, Mr Collins, to possess          the talent for flattering with delicacy.          Mr Collins nods with satisfaction.           Do these pleasing attentions proceed from          the impulse of the moment or are they the          result of previous study?          Jane kicks Elizabeth under the table. Elizabeth tries not          to laugh at Mr Collins' answer.           They arise chiefly from what is passing          at the time, and though I sometimes amuse          myself with arranging such little elegant          compliments, I always wish to give them          as unstudied an air as possible.           Believe me, no one would suspect your          manners to be practised.          The girls look at one another.           After dinner I thought I might read to          you all an hour or two. I have with me          Fordyce's sermons which speak eloquently          on this point.           Do you know Fordyce's sermons Miss          Bennet?           Later; we can see the girls and Mr Bennet gathered by the          fire through the doorway. Mr Collins leaves the room and          takes Mrs Bennet aside to a very discrete conference, out          of hearing of anyone else.           Mrs Bennet. You do know I have been          bestowed by the good grace of Lady          Catherine de Bough a parsonage of no mean          size.           I have become aware of the fact.                                                                                                                • Well, it.is my avowed hope that soon I          may find a mistress for it, and I have to          inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet          has captured my special attention.          Collins looks lasciviously into the room.           Mr Collins, unfortunately it is incumbent          on me to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet          is - very soon to be engaged.           Engaged!           But Miss Elizabeth next to her in both          age and beauty would make anyone an          excellent partner. Do not you agree, Mr          Collins?          Mr Collins looks through the doorway at Elizabeth           Indeed. Indeed. A very agreeable          alternative.            Elizabeth and Jane are walking towards the house when,          across the moat, they see Mr Collins come out of the          house and advance towards them.           Oh no!          Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the          garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them.           Quick! This way!          She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat,          through the house and out the front.          Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house.          The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around,          puzzled.           • Elizabeth and Jane arrive in the village. Jane, forever          the dutiful daughter, looks uneasy- Elizabeth is flushed          and reckless. She looks behind them-                                                                                                                  We've lost him.          They slow down to a walk. And then stop. outside the          milliner's shop the incorrigible Lydia and Kitty are          chatting to Wickham, the dashing young officer we spotted          earlier. He is utterly gorgeous - slim, handsome, tousled          hair. The perfect romantic hero.           Kitty? Lydia!          She and Jane join them.           We just happened to be looking for some          ribbon, didn't we, Kitty?           And we met Mr Wickham.           He picked up Lydia's gloves!           He's a lieutenant!          Wickham bows.           I'm enchanted. Shall we all look at some          ribbons together?           Oh yes!           They come into the shop. The others go towards the          counter. Wickham hangs back, and smiles a complicit,          witty smile at Elizabeth. She colours.           Though I must warn you, I have very poor          taste.            Only a man truly confident of himself          would admit that.           No, it's true. My rooms in town,          decorated, I thought, in the height of          • fashion, have reduced grown men to tears          of mirth.                                                                                                                 Then why don't you change them?           And deny people such pleasure?           So you don't mind being laughed at?           Not particularly.           It is a somewhat sterile quality, is it          not, to be aware of ones importance in          the world.           Especially if, like me, one has none.          Elizabeth looks at him with interest. A beat. The moment          is broken by Lydia coming up.           Lizzie, please lend me some money!            You already owe me a considerable sum,          Liddy.           Allow me to oblige.           No! Please - Mr Wickham! -          Wickham gives Elizabeth a smile and moves away to the          counter.           The girls emerge from the shop with Wickham.           You're too generous.           I know. Fivepence halfpenny!           It all adds up.           I'll pay him back.                                                                                                                Oh yes. I'll make sure of that.           They laugh. Elizabeth is really rather taken with him.          They walk down the street.           Will you be stationed here all winter, Mr          Wickham?           That depends on what the French have in          mind. Of course I look forward to          action...          (smiles at her)          But on the other hand           Lizzie - look!          They stop. Jane's face lights up.           Mr Bingley !          It is indeed Bingley, riding towards them. He is          accompanied by Darcy.          • Bingley jumps off his horse and hurries over to Jane. His          open, friendly face is filled with delight.           I was on my way to your house.           Please Mr Bingley, when are you going to          give a ball?           Lydia!           I was just waiting until your sister was          quite well.-           She is!          Elizabeth pays no attention to the following          conversation, instead she is looking at Darcy who, in          turn, is staring at Wickham. They both obviously          recognize each other and look very uncomfortable.           - when, then?                                                                                                                 As soon as they have made the white soup.           Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.          Darcy turns and rides off without a word.           Lydia, you can't just say that -           Will you excuse me ladies? Mr Wickham.          Enjoy the day.          Elizabeth looks at Wickham, puzzled.           A small cards party is underway. Three tables have been          set up. Elizabeth, Wickham, Jane, Lydia, Kitty, Charlotte          and Sir William and Lady Lucas are present. A small          number of officers and other ladies are also present. We          move around the tables. Kitty is sat with Sir William and          Charlotte and Mary. Jane sits at a table with Mr Collins          and Lady Lucas. Lizzie sits with Lydia and two other          officers. Lydia flirts outrageously.            We have asked mama if we might have new          dresses for the Netherfield ball.           Yes, white, they must be white.           White is the only colour to be worn this          season.           So I believe.          Mr Collins is at a table with Lady Lucas, he glances over          at Elizabeth, as he talks.           - of course, when you understand that          Lady Catherine de Bourgh is its          proprietor you will realise what an          immense compliment that is. Lady          Catherine spent eight hundred pounds on a          chimney-piece alone.          • Wickham who has been talking to some of the other          officers comes and sits beside Elizabeth, passing by Mr          collins on the way.                                                                                                                (aside to Elizabeth)          Your cousin is blessed with an uncommon          capacity for charm.          Elizabeth laughs and plays a hand.           Will you be attending the Netherfield          ball, Mr Wickham?           I hope to.           How long has Mr Darcy been a guest a          Netherfield?          Elizabeth pounces on this reference to Mr Darcy and takes          her chance.           About a month. Are you acquainted with,          Mr Darcy?           Indeed, my fate has been very intimate          with that gentleman. I have been          connected with his family since infancy.          Elizabeth is genuinely surprised, there is a pause while          she is forced to play her hand.           You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet,          especially given the cold manner of our          intimacy this afternoon. Are you well          acquainted with that gentleman?           As much as I could ever wish to be. I          have spent four days in the same house as          him, and I think him very disagreeable.           I cannot pretend to be sorry.          Elizabeth blushes.           But really I speak out of turn.          Collins voice breaks the moment.           Miss Elizabeth, I was just saying to Sir          William what appalling weather we've been          having.                                                                                                               Elizabeth cannot believe her misfortune in Mr Collins,          • but she smiles politely.           I think I shall take a little air.          She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony.          As she passes the other tables we follow and witness          snippets of their conversations.            It seems Mr Wickham has met with          universal approval. Though Lizzie looks          singularly pleased with him.           At the moment she has more suitors than          sense.          Charlotte looks over at Mr Collins. Elizabeth passes Sir          William's side of the table.           Now any one for a round of bridge?          Elizabeth?            Really I need to take some air.          Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth.           Mr Collins?           Oh, I am not so familiar with the game,          Sir William.           Absolute nonsense. I insist that you join          us.           Please, Mr Collins, I'd be happy if you'd           Collins resigns himself to his fate. Elizabeth smiles and          slips out into the night air.           Elizabeth breathes in the cold night air. She senses          someone join her. She looks round to see Wickham has          followed her as she had hoped.                                                                                                                • I hope your plans in favor of Meryton          will not be affected by your difficult          relations with the gentleman we were just          speaking of.           Oh no - it is not for me to be driven          away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he          must go not I.          Pause.           I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the          manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?           Do you really want to hear?          Lizzie nods.           He ruined me.          She stares at him.           How so?           My father managed his estate. We grew up          together, Darcy and I. His father treated          me like a second son. Oh he was the          kindest of men and bequeathed me the best          living in his gift, for I had my heart          set on joining the church. But when he          died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave          the living to another man.           Why did he do that?           Out of jealousy, for his father loved me          more than he loved him.           How cruel! Are you sure?            And out of pride, for he considered me          too lowly to be worth his consideration.           Pause. Lizzie gazes at him with horror and sympathy.                                                                                                                We pan through the bedrooms as the Bennet girls prepare          for the Netherfield ball. Kitty is helping Lydia into her          dress, they are both wearing white.           Aggghh!           Breathe in!          We move to the quieter preparations of Jane and          Elizabeth. This conversation has been going on for some          time.            - I still think there must have been a          misunderstanding.            Oh Jane, do you never think ill of          anybody?           0 How could Mr Darcy do such a thing? I          will discover the truth from Mr Bingley          at the ball this evening.           If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict          it himself. But until he does, I hope          never to encounter him.           Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.           On the contrary, he is twice the man          Darcy is.           And lets hope for you a rather more          willing dancer.          Jane leaves Elizabeth, at the mirror, taking very          particular care of her makeup. she smil6s to herself.           • The great doors of Netherfield open to reveal the ball in          full swing. Compared to the somewhat clod-hopping          Assembly, its a dazzling affair.                                                                                                               There are hundreds of guests. All the women, roughly two          hundred, are dressed in white. The men are either in red          • officer uniform or dressed in black and white. There are          a number of rooms each occupied by a different activity,          cards, buffet, women's closet. The final and grandest          room is the ball room, a swirl of elegant dance.          The Bennet's enter the first reception room, the girls,          including Mrs Bennet, are all dressed in white. Mr          Collins is slightly detained as people pass. Mr Bingley          bounds up to Jane.           You're here! I'm so pleased.           And so am I.           How are you, Miss Elizabeth?          Elizabeth is not paying attention, instead she is          searching over Mr Bingleys' shoulder for a sight of          Wickham.           Are you, looking for someone?           • No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor          of the ball.           It is lovely, Mr Bingley.          Bingley and Jane move off leaving Elizabeth with Mrs          Bennet and others. While Mrs Bennet talks we focus on          Elizabeth searching the sea of red coats.           (refering to Jane and           I dare say I have never met a more          pleasant gentleman in all my years. Look          how he dotes on her! Still Jane has          always done what is best for her family.          Elizabeth takes this opportunity to slip away into the          next room. Elizabeth looks around but cannot see Mr          Wickham. Suddenly she thinks she sees him, so starts to           a r, move over. The man turns round, it is not Wickham but           someone else.           Elizabeth walks nonchanantly into the next room, again           looking for Mr Wickham. She cranes around trying to see          • him then she is suddenly surprised by Charlotte Lucas.                                                                                                                 Have you seen Mr Wickham.          She shakes her head.           Perhaps he is in the ballroom.          They both walk into the ball room. We pull back to reveal          a sea of dancers. Wickham is nowhere to be seen. Jane          appears and catches Elizabeths arm.           He's not here. Apparently otherwise          detained.          The disappointment is palpable on Elizabeth's face.           Detained?          Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at          Elizabeth.           There you are.           Mr Collins. What a pleasant surprise.           Perhaps you will do me the honour, Miss          Elizabeth?           Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr          Collins.           I do not consider it incompatible with          the office of a clergyman to indulge in          such an innocent diversion.          Elizabeth tries to smile, politely.            In fact several people, her ladyship           included, have complimented me on my           lightness of foot.           Elizabeth's face is a matey rictus.           • They dance, the style of which is not unlike English          Country dancing.                                                                                                                • To be sure, dancing is of little          consequence to me, but it does afford the          opportunity to lavish'ones partner with          delicate attentions which is my primary          object of the evening.          Elizabeth turns as part of the dance and for a moment she          dances beside Jane.           Apparently Your Mr Wickham has been          called on some business to town, though          my informer told me he would have been          less inclined to be engaged had it not          been for the presence at Netherfield of a          certain gentleman.          Jane indicates towards where Darcy stands watching them.           That gentleman barely warrants the name.          The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins.           It is my intention, if I may be so bold          to remain close to you throughout the          evening.           Couples are preparing for the next dance. Elizabeth and          Charlotte are standing to one side when Mr Darcy          approaches.           May I have the next dance, Miss          Elizabeth.          Elizabeth is stunned.           You may.          Darcy walks away.           What was I thinking? Have I no presence          of mind?l           I dare say you will find him very          agreeable, Lizzie.                                                                                                                 Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest          misfortune of all - to find a man          agreeable whom one is determined to hate!           Elizabeth dances face to face with Darcy. Neither can          speak. They dance for a moment in silence.           I do love a Sarabande.           Indeed. Most invigorating.          They continue, for a moment, in silence.           It is your turn to say something, Mr          Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you          ought to remark on the size of the room          or the number of couples.           I am perfectly happy to oblige, please          advise me of what you would like most to          • hear.           That reply will do for the present.          Perhaps by and bye I may observe that          private balls are much pleasanter than          public ones. But for now we may be          silent.           Do you talk as a rule while dancing?           We are each of an unsocial, taciturn          disposition, unwilling to speak, unless          we expect to say something that will -          amaze the whole room, and be handed down          to posterity with all the eclat of a          proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid          embarrassment might be advantageous.           I see no striking resemblance of your own          character in this, how near it is to mine          I cannot say. (beat) Tell me do you and          your sisters very often walk to Meryton?           They are suddenly parted by the choreography of the          dance.                                                                                                               We stay with Elizabeth who is whisked round the floor by          an elderly man who smiles at her toothlessly, Elizabeth          • looks back at Darcy who is dancing with Lydia. He stare          at Elizabeth as he dances. Elizabeth smiles at her          current partner in embarrassment.           Very mild weather we've been having.           (deaf as a post)          Sorry.          The dance spins again and she is back with Darcy.           Yes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a          great opportunity to meet new people. In          fact when you met us we had just had the          pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.           I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed          with such happy manners as may ensure his          making friends - whether he is capable of          retaining them is less certain.           He has been so unlucky as to lose your          friendship. I remember hearing you once          say that your resentment once created was          unappeasable. You are very cautious, I          suppose, as to its being created?           I am. May I ask to what these questions          tend.           To make out your character, Mr Darcy.           And what have you discovered?           very little.          The dancefinishes.           I hear such different accounts of you as          puzzle me exceedingly.           I hope to afford you more clarity in the          • future.                                                                                                               • They bow to each other and Elizabeth moves quickly away          from Darcy.           Elizabeth is at the buffet watching Kitty quaff a huge          glass of wine and having the glass immediately refilled.          She is joined by Caroline Bingley who also looks at Kitty          disapprovingly.           Miss Elizabeth. Let me recommend you as a          friend not to give too much confidence to          all of the assertions your friend Mr          Wickham might make. He is indeed a          charming man, but one should never forget          from where he is descended.           His lack of trustworthiness and descent          appear by your account to be the same          thing,           Please excuse my interterence, it was          kindly meant.          • A breathless Mr Collins appears.           Is that Mr Darcy, of Pemberley in          Derbyshire?           I believe so.           But I must make myself known to him          immediately!           But sir -           He is the nephew of my esteemed          patroness, Lady Catherine.            He is?          Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards          Darcy.           Please, Mr Collins! He'll consider it an                                                                                                                Elizabeth watches from a distance, with acute          embarrassment, as Collins interrupts Darcy. Darcy does          not notice him so Collins raises his voice.           Mr Darcy!          The room around him stops. Darcy is surprised and turns          round. In dumbshow we see Darcy is horrified by Collins'          obsequiousness, during the conversation Collins points          Elizabeth out to Darcy.           What interesting relatives you have, Miss          Bennet.          Elizabeth walks away into another room.           The other room, where Mary is singing badly at the piano.          Elizabeth is horrified. She turns to leave only to see Mr          Bennet looking on. He winces as Mary misses a high note.          Mary finishes the song with an off key flourish. Polite          applause. Mary smiles and prepares for another song.           Aren't you going to do something?           Mr Bennet walks over to the piano.           Mary dear, you've delighted us long          enough.           But they asked for another song.          Mr Bennet shuts the lid.           Let the other young ladies have a turn.           Later. Charlotte and Lizzie are sat together.           Perhaps my family have made a competition          to see who can expose themselves to the          most ridicule.           Well, at least Bingley has not noticed.           They look over and see Jane and Bingley dancing. Bingley          clearly besotted by Jane.                                                                                                                • Yes. I think he likes her very much.           But does she like him? There are few of          us who are secure enough to be really in          love without proper encouragement.          Bingley likes her enormously but might          not do more if she does not help him on.           She is just shy and modest. If he does          not perceive her regard he is a fool.           We are all fools in love. He does not          know her character as we do. She should          move fast. Snap him up. There is plenty          of time for us to get to know them after          we're married -          Elizabeth looks over the dancefloor to see Lydia dancing          with a soldier. she's a little drunk, and very          flirtatious. He says something; she shrieks with          laughter.            Elizabeth sits at the side of the dance-floor. She looks          at Mrs Bennet dancing in outrageous fashion. Cut to          later: Lydia is getting more and more leery with a group          of soldiers, Elizabeth walks away in embarrasment only to          see Mr Collins smiling at her from across the room. Cut          to: Elizabeth dancing joylessly with the excruciating Mr          Collins, as she turns in the dance she sees Darcy look on          with obvious disdain. Cut to: much later, the band are          exhausted, guests are leaving. The staff are asleep on          their feet. Elizabeth almost alone watching her parents          dancing almost the only people left on the dance floor,          Kitty is asleep over Elizabeth's lap. This is a never-          ending nightmare.           Day light creeps through the curtains. Mrs Bennet is          sprawled on a sofa. Lydia completely drunk. Kitty asleep.          Jane sitting demurely. Collins looking longingly at          Elizabeth. Mrs Bennet is holding court, whilst the          footmen behind are literally ready to drop. Bingley is          standing, the perfect host, but obviously willing the          • Bennets to leave.                                                                                                                I have never had such a good time in my          life. Mr Bingley you must have such a          ball once a month at least.          Caroline who is standing with her brother, yawns          ostentatiously.           Mother. I really think it is time to go.           Don't be impertinent. our hosts are          perfectly happy with our company, are you          not, Mr Bingley? I hope I can entice you          to Longbourn to sample our hospitality.          We would make sure you had 3 or 4 courses          at least.          She holds out her glass for a top up and carries on.           So tell me Mr Bingley. Whom did you like          least of all your guests this evening?           Really. This is enough.          Darcy looking down at Elizabeth from a staircase. He          turns and walks away.           The Bennet's are squeezed into their carriage. It is          light outside. Only Mrs Bennet is awake but the lack of          an audience does not stop her from talking.           Allowing for new carriages, dresses          etcetera, etcetera. We will be having a          wedding here at Netherfield in less than          three months, if you ask me. Mr Bennet?          Mr Bennet!          5o INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURNE - DAY. 50          The Bennets eat in silence. Jane.yawns. Mrs Bennet moans -          she is hungover. Mr Collins comes in in a state of          agitation. They look at him. He sits, hesitates, then                                                                                                                 is MR COLLINS          Mrs Bennet I was hoping, if it would          not trouble you, that I might solicit a          private audience with Miss Elizabeth in          the course of the morning.          Elizabeth is open mouthed.           Oh! Yes. Certainly - Lizzy would be very          happy indeed. Please -- go ahead. No time          like the present. Everyone. Out. Mr          Collins would like a private audience          with your sister.          Everyone looks in amazement.           Wait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have          nothing to say to me.that anybody need          not hear.           No. Nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you-will          stay where you are. Everyone else, to the          drawing room. Mr Bennet.            But...            Now!          Mrs Bennet makes sure everyone leaves, winks at Mr          Collins then shuts the door before Elizabeth has time to          do anything. Elizabeth looks at Mr Collins who looks at          her in earnest. There is a horrible pause of intense          embarrassment.           Dear Miss Elizabeth, you can hardly doubt          the purpose of my discourse. My          attentions have been too marked to be          mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the          house I singled you out as the companion          of my future life.          Elizabeth stares at him, astonished.           But before I am run away with my feelings          perhaps I may state my reasons for          marrying. Firstly, that it is the duty of          a clergyman to set the example of          matrimony in his parish.                                                                                                                MR COLLINS (cont'd)          Secondly, that I am convinced it will add          greatly to my happiness, and, thirdly,          • that it is at the urging of my esteemed          patroness Lady Catherine that I select a          wife.          We here a kick and Kitty screach from behind the door.           sshhh.           My object in coming to Longbourn was to          choose such a one from amongst Mr          Bennet's daughters, for as you know I am          next in the entail of the estate and such          an alliance will surely make amends for          this.          (drops to his knee)          And now nothing remains for me but to          assure you in the most animated language          of the violence of my affections.           Mr Collins -           And that no reproach on the subject of          fortune will cross my lips once we are          • married.           You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I          have made no answer.            I must add, that Lady Catherine will          thoroughly approve, when I speak to her          of your modesty, economy and other          amiable qualities.           Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but          regret I must decline it.           (momentarily taken aback, but           I know ladies have their pretty little          ways, and don't seek to seem too eager -           (in some desperation)          Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You          could not make me happy and I'm convinced          I'm the last woman in the world who could          make you happy.                                                                                                                 I 'flatter myself, cousin, that your          refusal is merely a natural delicacy.          Besides, you should take into account          that despite your manifold attractions it          is by no means certain that another offer          of marriage may ever be made to you -           (rising, deeply affronted)          Mr Collins -           So I must conclude that you simply seek          to increase my love by suspense,          according to the usual practice of          elegant females.           Sir! I am not the sort of female to          torment a respectable man. Please          understand me - I cannot accept you!          Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house.          Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the          tail of Elizabeth.            Declined indeed! The headstrong, foolish            Thank you, but... Head strong?           - we shall have this little hiccup dealt          with immediately, Mr Collins.          Mrs Bennet goes chases after Elizabeth. Mr Collins          watches through a window as Elizabeth is chased by her          mother.           Mrs Bennet marches into the library. Mr Bennet looks up          in shock.           Oh Mr Bennet. We are all in a uproar. You          must come and make Lizzy marry Mr          Collins, for she vows she will not have          him.           Mr Bennet starter at Mrs Bennet blankley.                                                                                                                Mr Collins, Mr Collins has proposed to          Lizzie. But Lizzy declares she will not          have him, and now the danger is Mr          Collins may not have Lizzy.           And what am I to do?          Mrs Bennet drags Mr Bennet to his feet.           Speak to Lizzy.          They march to find Elizabeth.           Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet confront Elizabeth, who has been          waiting in the hallway. Perhaps the other girls form an          audience from the stairs, Mr Collins looks on sheepishly          from the breakfast room.           Tell her that you insist upon them          marrying.           Papa, please - '.           You will have this house!           I can't marry him!           You'll save your sisters from          destitution!           I can't! -           Go back now and say you've changed your          mind!           No!            Think of your family!           You can't make me!                                                                                                                Mr Bennet, say something!            So, your mother insists on you marrying          Mr Collins.-           Yes, or I shall never see her again?           Well, Lizzie. From this day on you must          be a stranger to one of your parents -            - who will maintain you when your father          is dead?           Your mother will never see you again if          you do not marry Mr Collins, and I will          never see you again if you do.             Thank you, papa.          Elizabeth turns around and walks into the drawing room.           Elizabeth enters the drawing room. In the drawing room,          Mary is trying to read, through the family din. Jane sits          very still. Her face is white. There's a letter in her          hand. Mrs Bennet charges in, Lydia and Kitty in tow, and          speaks to anyone who will listen.           Oh, ungrateful child! I shall never speak          to her again! Not that I have much          pleasure in talking to anybody. People          who suffer as I do from nervous          complaints can have no inclination for          talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer...          She jabbers on but her voice fades. We're with Jane, re-          reading the letter.           What's wrong, Jane?          Close on Jane's pale face. She's staring at the letter.                                                                                                                 But it is always so. Those who complain          are never pitied...           Bingley, Caroline and Darcy sit grimly in a carriage          which drives off.           Darcy looks severe and stern, Caroline can't help a          little smirk on her face. Bingley looks back longingly.           Elizabeth and Jane in bed.           I don't understand. What would take him          from Netherfield? Why would he not know          when he was to return?           • I have no reserves from you.          Jane passes Elizabeth the letter.           ""Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister          and we are scarcely less eager to meet          her again. I really do not think Georgina          Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance          and accomplishments, so much so I must          hope to hereafter call her my sister. It          is my duty to indulge you in no hope in          this respect for your own self.""           Is that not clear enough?           Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in          love with you and is gone with him to          persuade him otherwise.           But I know her to be incapable of          wilfully deceiving anyone.           • He loves you, Jane. Do not give up. Go to          our aunt and uncle's in London.                                                                                                                 Let it be known you are there and I am          sure he will come to you.            Jane is in a carriage. Mrs Bennet kisses her goodbye          through the window as all the Bennets look on.           Give my love to my sister. And try not to          be so much of a burden, dear.          Jane's carriage moves away and the family wave. Mr Bennet          talks to Elizabeth.           Poor Jane. However, a girl likes to be          crossed in love now and then. It gives          her something to think of, and a sort of          distinction among her companions.            I'm sure that will cheer her up,Papa.           It's your turn now, Lizzie. Since you've          turned down Mr Collins you're free to go          off and be jilted yourself. What about Mr          Wickham? He is a pleasant fellow and          would do the job credibly.           Thank you, but a less agreeable man would          satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's          good fortune.           Still, it's a comfort to know that          whatever might befall you, you have an          affectionate mother who will be sure to          make the most of it.          A small smile from Elizabeth.           Elizabeth is making the bed and tidying Jane's          belongings. There is a knock at the door and Charlotte          enters.           My dear Elizabeth, I've come here to tell          you the news.                                                                                                                • What news?            Mr Collins and I are engaged to be          married.          A stunned pause.           Engaged?            You don't mind, do you?           No, no...          (tries to recover)          Of course not.           He asked for my hand this morning .and          I accepted him.          Elizabeth looks quite faint. Charlotte sits on the bed.          Elizabeth, after a pause, sits down beside her.           I can see you're surprised - coming so          soon after his wishing to marry you...            No...           I'm not a romantic, you know. I ask only          a comfortable home, and considering Mr          Collin's character, and situation in          life, I am convinced that my chance of          happiness with him is as fair as most          people can hope for.           And that's all you expect?           For women in our situation, what choice          is there?            Don't speak like that, Charlotte!                                                                                                                • - to become an old maid, at best          tolerated, at worst a burden, dependent          on the kindness of others? Or to seek the          protection of marriage.           And we only have two choices?           Yes.          An appalled silence. Elizabeth gazes at her closest          friend. Charlotte has recovered herself. she now looks          cool and composed - unnervingly so.           You can still change your mind,          Charlotte.           (shakes her head)          I'm twenty-seven years old.          We hear the sound of the militia drums...            The militia are leaving Meryton. Hundreds of soldiers and          officers in the red coats marching out of the village to          the sound of pipes and drums. The villagers are out to          bid them farewell. Lydia and Kitty run through the crowds          very distraught. They find Elizabeth coming in the other          direction.           It's too dreadful! They're leaving for          Brighton.           All of them?           They got the call this morning.           Not a word of warning!          Lydia wails. Elizabeth searches the red coats for          Wickham. She spots him, he glances across at her, she          gives a pathetic wave and he's gone. Lydia and Kitty          chase the last of the officers, leaving Elizabeth alone.          She walks into the post office.                                                                                                                 The Postmaster hands a letter to Elizabeth. Elizabeth          opens it and reads it.           Bad news, Miss?           It could not be worse. I have been          invited to possibly the very last place          on earth I would like to go.           Elizabeth comes out of the post office to reveal...          Time has passed, the now deserted village is covered in a          thick blanket of snow. A lonely Elizabeth walks away          totally despondent.           Charlotte's new home is a smallish but charming rectory          in Kent. Charlotte greets Elizabeth, kissing her warmly.          • Mr Collins bows as he ushers her in.           Welcome to our humble abode...           There is a coop containing hens of various          descriptions ...a.pig-stye...a vegetable patch...a rose          bower. Charlotte and Mr Collins are showing Elizabeth          round the place.            And from here we have a good view of          Rosings Park, where we are honoured to          dine at least twice a week. Her          ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered          for us. I should say, one of her          ladyship's carriages, for she has          several.           My dear, I think our guest is tired after          her journey. Come on, Lizzie, let's get          some tea.                                                                                                                 • My wife encourages me to spend as much          time in the garden as possible, for the          sake of my health.          A beat. Lizzie glances at Charlotte, who remains          impassive.           I plan many improvements, of course.          (points to house)          I intend. to throw out a bow there, and          plant a lime walk.          (sharp look at Lizzie)          Oh yes, I flatter myself that any young          lady would be happy to be the mistress of          such a house.          A tiny nod from Elizabeth. She understands perfectly.           Lizzie and Charlotte are at last alone. They sit down,          with a certain relief, in a charming little parlour that          faces the front of the house. Charlotte pours out tea.           • We shall not be disturbed here, for this          parlour is for my own particular use.           Oh Lizzie, it's such a pleasure, to run          my own home!          A flash of understanding between them.           Charlotte! Come here!          Charlotte jumps up and rushes to the window.            What's happened?           Charlotte!            Has the pig escaped?          Lizzie joins her at the window. outside in the lane, Mr          Collins stands, bowing, at a carriage.            Its all right. Its just Lady Catherine.                                                                                                               They both burst out laughing. Just for a moment, the          • atmosphere is eased.           Tell me, how are things concerning Mr          Wickham?          Elizabeth's face changes.           I have not heard from Mr Wickham since          the regiment left for Brighton, but I am          informed by Lydia who keeps a breast of          all matters military that he does very          well.            Oh Lizzie.           we hear Mr Collins rushing back into the house, and           running up the stairs.            Great news! Great news!           He comes into the room, breathlessly excited.           • We have an invitation to visit Rosings          this evening from Lady Catherine de          Bourgh.          Elizabeth is not overcome with enthusiasm.           Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear          cousin, about your apparel. Just put on          that which is best among your clothes and          Lady Catherine will not think the worse          of you.           Elizabeth, Charlotte and Mr Collins walk hurriedly across          the lawns towards the great house. Beyond the toparied          hedges the grey building looms ominously above them. It          is grand without being elegant.           One of the most extraordinary sights in          all Europe, is it not. The glazing alone          cost upwards of twenty thousand pounds.                                                                                                                  Mr Collins, Charlotte and Elizabeth are led up a vast          stairway which is painted with visions of hell. Elizabeth          stops in front of a painting of a devil. She stares at          it, It seem to speak, but she realizes the voice is          Collins chiding her.           (as the devil)          This way!           The salon at Rosings is spectacularly grand; hideously          so. Heavy furniture, rows of servants. The three guests          are shown in by the footman. Again Mr Collins scrapes          the floor with his bow.           Your Ladyship.          (to the daughter)          Miss de Bourg.          Lady Catherine is a haughty, bossy woman. Pretty          • unspeakable, really. Her daughter is a sickly, irritable-          looking creature.           So you are Elizabeth Bennet.           I am, your ladyship.           (looking her up and down)          Hmm.          (indicates her daughter)          This is my daughter.            It's very kind of you to ask us to dine,          Lady Catherine.          Lady Catherine ignores her.           (whispers to Lizzie)          The chimneypiece alone cost £400.          But Lizzie doesn't hear. Darcy walks into the room.          Lizzie freezes. When he sees Lizzie he, too, falters, and          recovers himself. Another man (Fitzwilliam) is with him.                                                                                                                • Mr Darcy! What are you doing here?            Mr Darcy!          (another deep bow)          I had no idea we would have the honour...          A stiff bow from Darcy, who looks at Mr Collins as if          he's something brought in by the dog. He turns to Lizzie,          trying to collect himself.            Miss Bennet...I'm staying here.            You know my nephew?           Yes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting          him in Hertfordshire.          Darcy's friend Fitzwilliam, a much more easy-going chap,          introduces himself.           • Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?          He bows. Lizzie returns his smile gratefully. They move          towards the dining room. Mr Collins leans towards          Lizzie.            You know Mr Darcy is as good as engaged          to Miss de Bourg?           Really? Miss Bingley will be disappointed          to hear that.          (looks at the girl, and          whispers to charlotte)          What a sickly, cross little thing! Oh          yes, they should suit each other very          well.          Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more          intimidated by Rosings than Elizabeth is, and indeed has          more at stake.           68 INT. DINING ROOM - ROSINGS - NIGHT. f          9 The dining room is laid for a very grand dinner -- footmen          waiting, thousands of candles.                                                                                                               Lady Catherine seats herself at the head of the table.          The guests wait for their orders.            You sit there and you sit there. Mr          Collins! You can't sit next to your wife!          After some awkward shuffling around they all sit down.          Lizzie, much to her discomfort, finds herself sitting          next to Darcy. There is a pause.           I trust your family is in good health,          Miss Bennet?           They are, thank you.           My eldest sister is currently in London,          perhaps you happened to see her there?            I haven't been fortunate enough, no.          Lizzie looks at him. He colours slightly. Lady Catherine          addresses Lizzie in a loud voice, from the head of the          table.            Do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet?           A little, ma'am, and very poorly.           Oh. Do you draw?           No, not at all.           Your sisters, do they draw?           Not one.           That is very strange. But I suppose you          had no opportunity. Your mother should          have taken you to town every spring for          the benefit of the masters.           My mother would have no objection but my          father hates London.                                                                                                                • Has your governess left you?           We never had a governess.          Mr Collins squirms in embarrassment. Darcy watches          Elizabeth, keenly.           No governess? Five daughters brought up          at home without a governess, I never          heard such a thing! Your mother must have          been quite a slave to your education.           (can't help smiling at this)          Not at all, Lady Catherine.           Mmmm. Are any of your younger sisters          out?           Yes, ma'am. All.           All! What, five out at once? Very odd!          • And you only the second - the younger          ones out before the elders are married!          Your youngest sisters must be very young.           Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I          think it would be very hard on younger          sisters, not to have their share of          amusement because the elder is still          unmarried. And to be kept back on such a          motive! It would hardly encourage          sisterly affection.           Upon my word, you give your opinion very          decidedly for so young a person. Pray,          what is your age?            With three younger sisters grown up, your          Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to           it.          Lady Catherine looks astonished. Mr Collins shifts in          his seat. Mr Darcy glances sharply - in fact, admiringly          - at Lizzie. She's enjoying herself.                                                                                                                Dinner is over and they are drinking coffee. Darcy moves          towards Elizabeth but Lady Catherine interrupts, by          shouting from her seat.           Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us!           No, I beg you -           For music is my delight. In fact there          are few people in England who have more          true enjoyment of music than myself, or          better natural taste. If I had ever          learnt, I should have been a great          proficient.           So would Anne, if her health would have          allowed her.           Please, I told you I play poorly -            Come come, Elizabeth, her ladyship          demands it!          Lizzie reluctantly sits down at the piano and starts to          play. Lady Catherine takes no notice and talks loudly          over the music.           How does Georgina get along, Darcy?           She plays very well.           I hope she practises. No excellence can          be acquired without constant practice. I          have told Mrs Collins this.          (turns to Charlotte)          Though you have no instrument of your own          you are very welcome to come to Rosings          and play on the piano in the          housekeeper's room.           Thank you, your ladyship.                                                                                                                • You would be in nobody's way"", you know,          in that part of the house.          Darcy flinches at her bad manners. He moves away to the          piano where Lizzie is playing - not that terribly well,          it must be said. A moment passes.           You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by          coming in all your state to hear me, but          I won't be alarmed even though your          sister does play so well.           I am well enough acquainted with you,          Miss Bennet, to know I cannot alarm you          even should I wish it.          A beat. They eye each other warily. Colonel Fitzwilliam          joins them.            What was my friend like, in          Hertfordshire?           • You really care to know?          The colonel nods.           Prepare yourself for something very          dreadful.           The first time I saw him, at the          Assembly, he danced with nobody at all -          even though gentlemen were scarce and          there was more than one young lady who          was sitting down without a partner.            I knew nobody beyond my own party.            True, and nobody can be introduced in a          ballroom.           Fitzwilliam! Come here and talk to us!          0 Fitzwilliam moves away. Darcy and Elizabeth are alone.                                                                                                                I do not have the talent of conversing          easily with people I have never met          before.           Maybe you should take your aunt's advice          and practice.          Ouch! Darcy flinches. Lizzie turns away from him and          carries on playing. Darcy gazes at the curve of her neck.          She plays a false note, stumbles, and grimly carries on.           Elizabeth is writing a letter in the drawing room. She          starts ""Dear Jane..:"" The doorbell rings in the          background, she thinks nothing of it and continues. The          maid opens the door to the drawing room and Mr Darcy          enters.            Mr Darcy!          An awkward pause.           Please, do be seated.           I'm afraid Mr and Mrs Collins are gone on          business to the village.          A pause. What on earth does Mr Darcy want? He paces up          and down.           This is a charming house. I believe my          aunt did a great deal to it when Mr          Collins first arrived.           I believe so -- and she could not have          bestowed her kindness on a more grateful           Another pause.           Mr Collins seems very fortunate in his          choice of wife.                                                                                                                 He is indeed lucky to have found one of          the few sensible women who would have          accepted him.          Darcy sits down.           Shall I call for some tea?           No. Thankyou.          The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up.           Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a          pleasure.          He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused          and intrigued.           Charlotte, in the hallway, taking off her bonnet. Darcy          hurries past her, with a swift bow, and leaves abruptly.          Charlotte gazes after him in surprise.          • Charlotte heads to the drawing room where she finds          Elizabeth sitting, bemused.           What on earth have you done to poor Mr          Darcy?           I have no idea.          73 She truly doesn't. Charlotte gives Elizabeth a look 73           Sunday service is over and worshippers are leaving the ""          church. Mr Collins, in his vestments, obeises himself to          Lady Catherine, who is sweeping out with her miserable-          looking daughter and downtrodden governess. Elizabeth          joins Colonel Fitzwilliam. They walk down the path          together.           How long do you plan to stay in Kent,          Colonel?           As long as Darcy chooses. I am at his          disposal.                                                                                                                I do imagine your cousin brought you down          with him chiefly to have someone to order          around. I wonder he does not marry and          secure a lasting convenience of that          kind.           She would be a lucky woman.           Really?           Darcy is a most loyal companion. From          what I heard, on our journey here, he          recently came to the rescue of one of his          friends just in time.          Darcy, waylaid by various people, comes out of the          church. His eyes search for Elizabeth. He sees her with          Fitzwilliam and hesitates. Too late! Mr Collins steps up          to him and engages him in conversation. Elizabeth stops,          at the churchyard gate.           What happened?            He saved the man from an imprudent          marriage.            Who was the man?           His closest friend. Mr Bingley.          A silence.           Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for          this interference?           There were apparently strong objections          to the lady.           What kind of objections? Her lack of          fortune?           I think it was her family that was          considered unsuitable.                                                                                                                So he separated them?           I believe so. I know nothing else.          Elizabeth grows pale. She turns to look at Darcy who is          joined by his aunt.           I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well          in finding partners suitable to their          very high standards. Good morning, Col.          Fitzwilliam.          76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76          parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a          distance.           Lizzie walks across the park - anywhere, she hardly          cares. She is in a turmoil of misery and fury. How could          Darcy do such a terrible thing! It starts to rain.           • A Grecian summer house by the lake. The rain is now          bucketing down. Lizzie hurries into the summer house and          sits down, heavily, on a bench.          Her poor sister; Lizzie gazes in despair at the rain-          lashed landscape.          A man approaches, across the park. He draws nearer.          It's Darcy. Elizabeth stiffens. He's hurrying towards          her. Sodden, breathless, he comes into the. summer house.          He is in a state of agitation - far too agitated to          notice her upset face.           Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but          I can bear it no longer ... . The past          months have been a torment...          He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in          astonishment. He struggles on.           I came to Rosings with the single object          of seeing you...I had to see you...           • Me?                                                                                                                • I've fought against my better judgement,          my family's expectation...           The inferiority of your birth.. .my rank          and circumstance...           all those things.. .but I'm willing to put          them aside... and ask you to end my          agony...           I don't understand...            I love you. Most ardently.          Elizabeth stares at him.           Please do me the honour of accepting my          hand.          A silence. Elizabeth struggles with the most painful          confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers.            Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have          been through, and I am very sorry to have          caused you pain. Believe me, it was          unconsciously done.          A silence. Gathering her shawl, she gets to her feet.            Is this your reply?           Yes, sir.           Are you laughing at me?           No?           Are you rejecting me?            I'm sure that the feelings which, as          you've told me, have hindered your          regard, will help you in overcoming it.                                                                                                               A terrible silence, as this sinks in. Neither of them can          • move. At last, Darcy speaks. He is very pale.           Might I ask why, with so little endeavour          at civility, I am thus repulsed?           (trembling with emotion)          I might as well enquire why, with so.          evident a design of insulting me, you          chose to tell me that you liked me          against your better judgement. If I was          uncivil, that was some excuse -           Believe me, I didn't mean -           But I have other reasons, you know I          have!           What reasons?           Do you think that anything might tempt me          to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps          for ever, the happiness of a most beloved          sister?          Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the          face.           Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you          separated a young couple who loved each          other, exposing your friend to the          censure of the world for caprice, and my          sister to its derision for disappointed          hopes, and involving them both in misery          of the acutest kind?           I do not deny it.            How could you do it?           Because I believed your sister          indifferent to him.           • Indifferent?                                                                                                                • I watched them most carefully, and          realized his attachment was much deeper          than hers.           That's because she's shy!           Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded          that she didn't feel strongly for him.           Because you suggested it!           I did it for his own good.           My sister hardly shows her true feelings          to me!          (pause, takes a breath)          I suppose you suspect that his fortune          had some bearing on the matter?            No! I wouldn't do your sister the           dishonour. Though it was suggested -            What was?           It was made perfectly clear that-an          advantageous marriage...            Did my sister give that impression?           No!          An awkward pause.           There was, however, I have to admit...          the matter of your family -           Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't          vex himself about that!            No, it was more than that.                                                                                                                How, sir?           (pause, very uncomfortable)          It pains me to say this, but it was the          lack of propriety shown by your mother,          your three younger sisters - even, on          occasion, your father. Forgive me.          Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down.           You and your sister -- I must exclude from          this...          Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth          glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery.           And what about Mr Wickham?           Mr Wickham?           What excuse can you give for your          behavior to him?            You take an eager interest in that          gentleman's concerns!           He told me of his misfortunes.           Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very          great indeed!           You have ruined his chances, and yet          treat him with sarcasm?           So this is your opinion of me! Thank you          for explaining so fully. Perhaps these          offences might have been overlooked, if          your pride had not been hurt -           My pride?           - by my honesty in admitting scruples          about our relationship.                                                                                                                  Could you expect me to rejoice in the           inferiority of your circumstances?            And those are the words of a gentleman?          From the first moment I met you, your          arrogance and conceit, your selfish          distain of the feelings of others, made          me realize that you were the last man in          the world I could ever be prevailed upon          to marry.          Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence.           Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much          of your time.          He leaves, abruptly.          Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What          has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears.           Elizabeth comes in soaked to the skin. Charlotte runs to          her.           Elizabeth!           I was caught somewhat off-guard.           Charlotte attends to Elizabeth.who has changed and is          drying her hair, a shawl around her shoulders.           Shall I call the doctor?           No! Charlotte, I shall be quite all          right. Please, give Lady de Bourgh my          apologies. You must not keep her waiting.          Mr Collins clatters up the stairs.           (popping his head around the           Come on. We shall be late!                                                                                                                Charlotte leaves, reluctantly, and goes downstairs.           Later; The sound of the front door closing. Elizabeth          sits down, heavily, on the bed. She walks downstairs and          enters the drawing room.           Elizabeth is in the drawing room, she looks at a book on          the table. It is Fordyce's Sermons. She puts it down and          walks to the mirror and stares at herself. After a moment          suddenly Darcy's face appears. She freezes. They stare at          each other without speaking. Finally...           I came to leave you this.          He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth          does not turn but watches him through the mirror.           I'm not going to renew the sentiments          which were so disgusting to you, but to          address the two offenses you have laid          against me. I had not long been in          Hertfordshire before I saw that Bingley           preferred your eldest sister. I observed          my friend's behaviour attentively and I          could perceive that his partiality for          Miss Bennet was beyond what I have ever          witnessed in him.          Elizabeth cannot bring herself to look at Darcy. She          stares at her own reflection as he speaks.           Yet when I observed your sister .1          detected no symptom of peculiar regard,          and witnessed only the families coarse          appetite for having their daughters          married favorably. And so in London,          perhaps erroneously, I persuaded him of          the unfitness of the match citing your          sisters coolness towards him.          We zoom in on Elizabeth's reflection.           It was unknowingly done and though the          motives which governed me may to you          appear naturally insufficient, they were          done to protect a friend. As to the other          • more serious matter..                                                                                                               As Elizabeth turns she realises Darcy has gone. Darcy's          voice carries.           ""My father provided for Mr Wickham a          valuable living.          Elizabeth tears open the envelope, her hands shaking, and          reads the letter, as Darcy's voice carries on.           ""But upon his death, however, Mr Wickham          told me that he had no intention of          taking orders and would I recompense him          to the tune of £3000 so he could go to          town and study the law.          We circle Elizabeth as she reads.            This I did, though by now I had some          doubts about his character. These were          confirmed by reports that he had sunk          into a life of idleness, gambling and          dissipation. The money was soon used up,          whereupon he wrote demanding more money          which I refused, whereupon he severed all           Holding the letter she looks out of the window to see          Darcy riding away.           ""But last summer he was unwillingly          obtruded on my notice when he connived a          relationship with my sister whom he          persuaded to be in love with him and made          her consent to an elopement. She was but          fifteen.           Darcy rides off.           Mr Wickham's prime objective was her          inheritance of thirty thousand pounds but          hope of revenging me was a strong          inducement. I was lucky enough to          persuade my sister of her folly. I hope          this goes someway to mitigating my          behaviour in your eyes. If you doubt my          word please have it confirmed by my           cousin Fitzwilliam.                                                                                                                Elizabeth with the letter. Charlotte walks in. Elizabeth          is shaking.           Lizzy: Are you alright?           I do not know. I hardly know myself.          Elizabeth looks at Charlotte utterly shaken.           Elizabeth riding in a carriage through Cheapside, reading          the letter.           P.S. As we shall never meet again, I wish          you all happiness in the future.          Elizabeth looks out at the high warehouse building and          the bustle of trade. There is no horizon.          is 79 INT. GARDINERS HOUSE - CHEAPSIDE - DAY. 7          Mrs Gardiner, the girls' kindly aunt, is taking          Elizabeth's coat from her.           How fortunate, you are here just in time          to catch everybody coming through from          Longbourn.           How is Jane?          Mrs Gardiner smiles sadly.           She is outside.          Through a window Elizabeth sees Jane sitting quietly          alone at her needle work.             Elizabeth and Jane sit together in the small walled          garden.                                                                                                               Jane is all smiles, but behind her eyes is a sadness          unseen before. Elizabeth is desperate to unburden herself          • but feels unable.           I am quite over him, Lizzie. If he passed          in the street I would hardly notice.          London is so diverting...           oh Jane...           Its true! What with the theatre and...          But tell me, what news from Kent?           Nothing. Everything as you might imagine.          Elizabeth tries to smile. There is a crash as all the          Bennet's arrive at the house. Kitty rushes into the          garden crying her eyes out, she is followed by Lydia and          Mrs Bennet.           Lizzie, tell mama, tell her!             Mrs Forster has invited me.            Why didn't she ask me as well?           Kitty, what's happened?           - because she likes me better.           I've just as much right as Lydia -           Oh, if I could but go to Brighton -           - and more so, because I'm two years          older!          Elizabeth looks to Jane.           Lydia has been invited to Brighton with          the Foresters.                                                                                                                • A little sea-bathing would set me up very            I shall dine with the officers every          night!          An anguished wail from Kitty.           I'm sure I cried for two days when          Colonel Millar's regiment went away.          thought I should have broke my heart.           Mother! Are you all mad?          She glares at them, deeply upset -- by them, by          everything.           Elizabeth has found a quiet corner with her father.           Please Papa, don't let her go!           Lydia will never be easy till she has          exposed herself in some public place or          other, and we can never expect her to do          it with so little inconvenience as under          the present circumstances.           (with great emotion)          If you, dear father, will not take the          trouble to check her, she will be fixed          forever as the silliest and most          determined flirt who ever made her family          ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she          always does.           We shall have no peace until she goes.           (really angry now)          Peace! Is that all you care about?           Colonel Forster is a sensible man and          will keep her out of any real mischief,          and she is far too poor to be an object          of prey to anyone.                                                                                                                Father, its dangerous! -           I'm sure the officers will find women          better worth their while. Let us hope, in          fact, that her stay in Brighton will          teach her her own insignificance. At any          rate she can hardly grow any worse,          without authorizing us to lock her up for          the rest of her life.          Elizabeth gazes at her father - will nothing touch him?          He gave up on his daughter long ago. For this, just now,          she hates him.           No wonder our family is treated with          contempt.          She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks          puzzled at her outburst.           Mr Bennet follows Elizabeth in.           Well, at least the house will be quieter.           I don't wish to be stuck with such a          foolish family any longer, with your          constant talk of men and marriages.          Surely there is more to life.           Lizzie dear, you would be very welcome to          accompany us?           Oh yes. We plan to journey through the          Peak District. You'd be most welcome.           Oh, the glories of nature! What are men,          compared to rocks and mountains?           Believe me, men are either eaten up with          arrogance or stupidity. And if they're          amiable they're so easily led that they          have no minds of their own whatsoever.                                                                                                                Take care, my love, that savours strongly          of bitterness.           No, they bring nothing but heartache.           As usual Elizabeth and Jane share a bed. They lie next to          each other in the darkness           I saw Mr Darcy when I was in Rosings.           Why did you not tell me. Did he mention          Mr Bingley.          Pause.           No. He did not.          Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her          sister.            A ravishing landscape of savage and romantic beauty -          scudding clouds, mountains, wild rocky outcrops.          Elizabeth is walking freely, the wind in her hair. As she          nears the peak of a promontory, Mr and Mrs Gardiner are          below making their way towards her. They smile at her.          She strides off determined to reach the very top. When          she gets there she stands with her arms outstretched, her          head back laughing into the wind. The view is          magnificent. She breathes deeply.           An establishing shot of Lambton, a charming market town.          Through the window of an inn we see Elizabeth and Mr and          Mrs Gardiner at a table.            In the inn, the Gardiner's and Elizabeth are eating          supper. An air of high spirits. At the next table,          another amiable tourist couple are also tucking into          their food.                                                                                                                 • (indicating her husband)          He's been taking the waters at Buxton.           Hasn't done him a jot of good.           But we've had a fine time, haven't we          dear?           We've visited Chatsworth, Dovedale,            Pemberley?           Just two miles from here.          close, very close, on Lizzie's face.           One of the best houses in the country.            Aren't you acquainted with the owner, Mr          • Darcy?           Well, we shall go there tomorrow, Lizzie.           I would rather stay here.           Stay here?            I must own that I'm tired of great          houses. All those carpets and curtains.           But you liked Chatsworth.           If it is anything like Mr Darcy, I am          sure I will not be able to bear it.           Come, come, Lizzie.            The grounds alone are worth a visit.                                                                                                                Let us not make a fuss. If the girl does          not want to go there is little point in          persuading her.           Elizabeth is preparing for bed. The chambermaid fills her          washbowl and starts to leave.           I hear that Pemberley is not far from          here.           Yes, madam.           You see something of the owner, do you,          in town?           Not for some months, madam, for he's          still in London, I believe.          A pause. Close on Elizabeth's face.           88 EXT. PEMBERLEY - DAY. 8n          The carriage enters the gates of Pemberley.           I'm so glad you changed your mind.          Elizabeth is alert, her eyes bright with curiosity. The          parkland is wild and rocky. Deer graze; rooks wheel in          the sky. A sense of freedom and liberation. As the          carriage drives over the top of a hill, close on          Elizabeth's face. She gasps. The Gardiners gasp.          A huge, wide shot of Pemberley House. It's vast,          breathtakingly beautiful, set in great boulder-strewn          park lands. A mansion built of golden stone, glowing in          the sunlight.           Elizabeth walks through the magnificent grounds.           Imagine being mistress of all this. It is          as big as all Cheapside.          Elizabeth is lost in admiration.                                                                                                                Elizabeth and the Gardiners are being taken on the tour          by the housekeeper, Mrs Reynolds, who witters on in the          background with descriptions of each room. Elizabeth is          apart and we witness the exquisite house from her point          of view. A book lies open, on a reading desk, Elizabeth          turns it over to read the title.            Keep up.          They walk through room after amazing room: a breath-          taking library, an unbelievable staircase.           The huge picture gallery. Elizabeth is apart from the          rest looking at the pictures she stops by a painting of          Darcy. She looks at it thoughtfully but is interrupted by          Mrs Reynolds and the Gardiners who are following her.           This is my master - Mr Darcy.           A handsome face. Lizzie, is it a true          likeness of him?           Does this young lady know Mr Darcy?           Only a little.           And do you not think him a handsome man,          Miss?            Yes, yes I suppose he is.          Mrs Reynolds moves the Gardiners on to another painting,          but Elizabeth stays, staring at Darcy's image.           And this is his sister, Miss Georgians.          She plays and sings all day long.          We realize that in the distance we have heard music.          Elizabeth is still gazing at the portrait of Darcy, then          suddenly snaps out of her reverie, as she processes Mrs                                                                                                                 • They are at home?!           Miss Darcy is always down for the summer.          Mr Darcy is due here tomorrow.           Is your master much at Pemberley?           Not as much as I would wish, sir, or he --          for he dearly loves it here.          Relaxed again Elizabeth wanders off as the Gardiners talk          to Mrs Reynolds.           If he should marry, you might see more of          him.           Yes madam, but I do not know when that          will be. I do not know a lady who is good          enough for him.           What do you mean?            I've known Mr Darcy since he was a boy.          He was always a kind and generous person          even then. Not everyone can see it,          because he does not make a meal of it          like a lot of young men nowadays. But he          is the most sweet-tempered and kind-          hearted man I have ever known.           As the Gardiners look at more paintings, Elizabeth drifts          out through the open doors and onto a terrace. In the          bright sunlight the view of the gardens and valley beyond          is exquisite. Outside the music we heard before is          louder.           Elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace, being          unconsciously drawn by the music. Suddenly Elizabeth          recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played          earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She          follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets          • closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she          is outside the room where the music is being played.                                                                                                               She steals herself a moment, but her curiosity gets the          better of her and she discretely peeps in.           Through the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful          fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and          fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After          sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly          hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind          Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes.          Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She          stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face.          It is Darcy.          Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him          there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him.          For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with          surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure,          Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her.           Miss Bennet!          Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches          up with her. They both blush, deeply.           I thought you were in London.            No... I'm not.           No.          Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once.           I came here a day early - We wouldn't have come -           -- some business with my I'm so terribly sorry -           They stop. He gazes at her with great emotion.           I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and          aunt.           (trying to recover)          And are you having a pleasant trip?           Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock.                                                                                                                • Tomorrow?           Are you staying at Larnbton?           Yes. At the Rose and Crown.          Another pause. She extends her hand.           I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the          house was open for visitors. I had no          idea...          She shakes his hand and starts to walk away.           May I see you to the village?           Oh no! I'm very fond of walking.           Yes.           Goodbye, Mr Darcy.           She hurries away. He gazes after her.           A wood. Now she is out of sight Lizzie collapses on a          log. She is utterly undone. Around her, the birds sing.           It's that night. Lizzie comes downstairs, for supper. And          stops. Through a gap in the door to the restaurant she          sees Mr Darcy talking to her aunt and uncle.           - I shall send my carriage at noon          After a moment Darcy leaves and Elizabeth approaches the          table.           Lizzie, I've just met Mr Darcy! Why          didn't you tell us you had seen him? He's          asked us to dine with him tomorrow - He          was very civil, was he not?            Very civil.                                                                                                                • Not at all like you painted him.            To dine with him?           - there is something pleasing about his          mouth, when he speaks.           You don't mind delaying our journey for          another day?          Elizabeth shakes her head, dumbly.           He particularly wishes you to meet his          sister.           His sister?           A footman escorts Elizabeth and the Gardiner's through          the stupendous library. From the drawing room, the sound          of a piano playing.. It's the same music Elizabeth played          at Rosings, but this time played very beautifully.          Elizabeth is filled with trepidation; we can almost feel          her heart racing.          The footman opens the double doors to reveal the          magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the          dreaded Miss Bingley. Seeing her, Elizabeth's polite          smile falters. Darcy's sister Georgiana plays the piano.          She jumps up and hurries over.           My sister, Miss Darcy...          They smile and bob. Georgiana is a friendly, sweet girl.           Miss Elizabeth, my brother has told me so          much about you. I feel as if we are          friends already.           What a beautiful instrument.           My brother gave it to me.          (smiles at him)          He shouldn't have.                                                                                                                • Yes I should.           Oh very well then.           She's easily persuaded, is she not?          They gaze at each other with affection. Miss Bingley          approaches.            What a surprise, Miss Bennet, to see you          in Derbyshire.            Your brother is well, I trust?           Very well. He hopes to come here soon.          (significant glance at           Pemberley has a special attraction for          him.            Yes, the library is particularly          splendid, is it not?          A small silence. Darcy, uneasy at their conversation,          approaches.           And how is your family, Miss Bennet?          Someone told me the militia are removed          from Meryton.           They must be a great loss for some of you          Darcy comes to the rescue.           Your uncle is fond of fishing, I hear.           Yes, very.           (drawing her away)          Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this          afternoon?                                                                                                                 For the lake here is very well stocked          and its occupants left in peace for far          • too long.          Elizabeth smiles, surprised and delighted. And grateful          to be rescued. What does Mr Darcy mean by this?          She moves away, to speak to her uncle. Miss Bingley moves          closer to Darcy.           In six months I have never seen anyone so          altered. How brown and coarse she has          become!           I perceive no alteration' except she is          rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous          consequence of travelling in the summer.           I remember, when we first knew her in          Hertfordshire, you said ""she a beauty? I          would have as soon called her mother a          wit!""           You must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even          had I thought it, I would have couched it           with a little more finesse.          Elizabeth looks across at Darcy - they smile at each          other.           Darcy is driving Elizabeth and the Gardiner's back to          Lampton. The rugged landscape looks even more beautiful          and dramatic in the dusk light. Elizabeth sits up with          Darcy who holds the reins, while Mr and Mrs Gardiner sit          comfortably in the carriage. Mr Gardiner smiles broadly          at two large fish that lie beside him.           It is so beautiful up here. I will be          sorry to leave.          Darcy smiles at her.           You have been a most gracious host. I'm          sure my aunt and uncle will talk of          nothing else for days.           I have recently thought a great deal          about how I appear and act to others.                                                                                                               She smiles softly at Darcy.            It does you credit, sir.           The party arrive back at the inn.           (quietly to Elizabeth)          What a capital fellow.           Thank you so much Mr Darcy.          Darcy is about to take his leave when a servant brings          Elizabeth a letter.            For you, madam.            107 Its from Jane. 10          • she rips open the letter.           Elizabeth is crying with the open letter in her hand.          Darcy and Mr and Mrs Gardiner stand dumb, not quite          knowing what to do. Elizabeth tries to speak but bursts          into tears again. She cries for a long time.           Miss Elizabeth.          She cries on.           Miss Elizabeth.          She eventually gathers herself.           It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has          run away - with Mr Wickham. They are gone          together from Brighton to Lord knows          where. She has no money, no connections,          I fear she is lost forever.                                                                                                                 • (quietly to Elizabeth)          This is my fault - if only I had exposed          Wickham when I should.           No, this is my fault. I might have          prevented all of it by merely being open          with my sisters rather than too proud          with my knowledge.          Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed.           Has anything been done to recover her?           Father has gone to London. But I know          very well that nothing can be done. We          have not the smallest hope.           Would to heaven that anything could be          said or done on my part that could offer          consolation to such distress.           Sir, it think it is too late.            I am afraid we must go at once - I will          join Mr Bennet and find Lydia before she          ruins the family forever.           I am so very sorry. This is grave indeed.          I will leave you. Goodbye.          Darcy pauses at the door, looks back at Elizabeth and          then is gone.           The Gardiner's carriage racing through the night.           Elizabeth, Jane, Mary and Kitty are gathered around Mrs          Bennet who has taken to her bed.           Why did the Foresters let her out of          their sight? I always said they were          unfit to have charge of her.                                                                                                                 And now she is ruined.           You are all ruined. Who will take you now          with a fallen sister? Poor Mr Bennet will          now have to fight the perfidious Wickham          and then be killed...           He hasn't found him yet, Mama.           - and The Collins' will turn us out          before he is cold in his grave -           Do not be alarmed, mama. Our uncle is          helping in the search.           Lydia must know what this will do to my          nerves, such flutterings and spasms all          over me...            Were looking directly down onto a London street. Mr          Bennet stands still against the passing pedestrian          traffic. He tries to address a passer by.           Excuse me.          They ignore him. He tries again           Excuse me, I'm looking for...          Mr Bennet takes out a piece of paper.           Mr Bennet walks timidly into the mess hall. It is smoky,          drunken, noisy, boisterous and extremely threatening. Mr          Bennet stops at the threshold, gulps, then the whole room          turns round to look at him and a sudden silence descends.          Mr Bennet is terrified.            I am...(his voice breaks up - he clears           his throat) I am looking for a Mr          • Wickham.                                                                                                                 Elizabeth and Jane are outside Mrs Bennet's room. From          inside we hear a moan.           We are ruined. Ruined.           How long is this going to go on for?           Don't be too harsh. This is hard for all          of us.          They walk downstairs.           Elizabeth and Jane walk into the drawing room. Kitty and          Mary are busying themselves.           I can't bear not hearing anything.           Look. It's Papa!           The girls rush into the library. Mr Bennet slumps at his          desk.           - who is to fight Wickham and make him          marry Lydia, now you've come home?           For God's sake let me be!           Lizzie, help me with my boots.          Elizabeth pulls off his boots for him.           You suppose them to be still in London?            Where else could they be so well          concealed?            Oh father, I'm so sorry.                                                                                                                • It's been my own doing.           You mustn't be too severe on yourself.           No Lizzie. Let me once in my life feel          how much I have been to blame.           I am not afraid of being overpowered by          the experience. It will pass away soon          enough.           We're looking through a window to the stairwell of a          seedy looking boarding house. An anonymas pair of mens          boots appear climbing up the stairs. We move across the          exterior wall of the building to find an open window          through which Lydia and Wickham can be seen.          Lydia and Wickham sit, snuggled close beside the fire in          their room in a humble lodging house. They're eating a          meal with relish. Giggling, Lydia feeds him a mouthful.          A knock at the door. They freeze, like naughty children.            The girls have a letter. Kitty grabs it from Jane, Mary          grabs it from Kitty, before she has a chance to open it          Jane grabs it from Mary.           It's to Daddy. It's in uncle's writing.          Mr Bennet snatches the letter.           As it is addressed to me...          He tears it open and begins to read, squinting because he          has forgotten his glasses.           He's found them.           Are they married?           (squinting at the letter)          Just wait. I can't make out his script.                                                                                                               Elizabeth snatches it.            Give it to me. (she reads)           Are they married?           They will be, if father will settle a          hundred pounds a year on her. That is          Wickham's condition.           A hundred pounds!           You will agree to this, father?          The letter is passed around the other girls.           Of course I will agree. But how much your          uncle has laid on this wretched man          already is anybody's guess.           What do you mean, Father?            No man in his senses would marry Lydia on          so slight a temptation as a hundred a          year.           Ah, I see.           See what?           Your uncle is very generous.           Do you think it a large sum?           Wickham's a fool if he takes her for less          than ten thousand pounds. I should be          sorry to think so ill of him in the very -          beginning of our relationship.           Ten thousand! Heaven forbid!                                                                                                               • 107 INT. MR & MRS BENNET'S BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. It          Close on Mrs Bennet's face as she springs out of bed.          Pure triumphant joy.           Lydia married! And at sixteen too! Ring          the bell, Kitty! I must put on my things          and tell Lady Lucas! Oh to see her face!          And tell the servants they will have a          bowl of punch!          The other Bennet's are assembled.           We should thank our uncle, Mama.           And so he should help! He's much richer          than us, and he hasn't got any children.            How can you talk like that?          Her mother gets to her feet.            A daughter, married!           Is that all you think about?           ""Mrs Wickham"" - how well it sounds            You don't know what he's like           Now where will they live? Purvis Lodge          might do. Ashworth is vacant of course,          but it's too far off, I couldn't bear to          have her ten miles from me -           Before you take any of these houses, Mrs          Bennet, let us be clear. Into one house          she will never be welcome.          Mrs Bennet stares at him.                                                                                                                 Lydia's triumphant face. The cat that's got the cream.          She comes into the house with Wickham. Her mother kisses          her, effusively. Mr Bennet coldly bows.           - and then we passed Sarah Sims in her          carriage so I took off my glove and let          my hand just rest on the window frame, so          she might see the ring, and then 1 bowed          and smiled like anything!          Kitty shrieks with envy. Lizzie moves away; she cannot          bear it. Wickham catches her eye, but she ignores him.           They are taking their seats for dinner. Lydia moves to          the head of the table.           Jane, I take your place now, and you must          go lower, for I am the married woman.          She sits down and giggles at her sisters. The maid brings          • in the food. Lydia holds up her hand, to display her ring          to the maid.           You must all go to Brighton, for that is          the place to get husbands! I hope you          have half my good luck.            Lydia!           Wickham looking uncomfortable. He's talking to the stony-          faced Mr Bennet.           I've been enlisted in a regiment in the          north of England, sir.          l f G MR BENNET           I'm glad to hear of it.           Near Newcastle. We shall travel there          next week.                                                                                                                • Can I come and stay with you?           That is out. of the question.           Lydia, rattling on to Lizzie.           Well, Monday morning came and I was in          such a fuss -           I don't want to hear -           - there was my aunt, preaching and          talking away just as if she was reading a          sermon, she was horrid unpleasant -           Can't you understand why?           - but I didn't hear a word because I was          thinking of my dear Wickham. I longed to          • know whether he would be married in his          blue coat...           Mary turning to Wickham.           The north of England, I believe, boasts          some spectacular scenery...           Lydia burbling on, to a stony-faced Lizzie.           - and then my uncle was called away from          the church on business and I thought -          who is to be our best man if he doesn't          come back? Lucky he did come back or I          would have had to ask Mr Darcy -            Mr Darcy?           (claps her hand to her mouth)          I forgot! I shouldn't have said a word!                                                                                                                Mr Darcy was at your wedding?            He was the one that discovered us! He          knew where to find Wickham, you see.           But don't tell anyone! He told me not to          tell!          Lizzie stares at her. Darcy at her wedding? Lydia turns          away, to talk to the others.           Lydia, croquet mallet in hand, drags her new husband          across the lawn. Kitty follows.           Come on, Wickham! You've got to play.           Yes, come on!          Wickham looks slightly abashed - a trapped man. What has          he let himself in for?          Lizzie comes into the garden, looking for her younger          sister. Wickham detaches himself and comes over to her. A          rueful smile.           I hope we can be even better friends, now          we're brother and sister.          An attempt at a twinkling smile, but Elizabeth is now          immune to his charm. She nods, briefly.           I hear you visited Pemberley. My dear old          home.            I met Mr Darcy's sister.            Did you like her?           Very much.          (looks at him)          We found a great deal to talk about.                                                                                                               A beat. Wickham looks deeply uneasy. He bows and leaves.          Lizzie watches him pick up a mallet and take his turn.          She can't bear it; she hurries up to Lydia and draws her          aside.            Why was Mr Darcy there?           I'm not supposed to tell.          Lizzie abandons her pride. She takes Lydia's hand.           Please, Lydia!           Because he paid for it.            For what?            The wedding, Wickham's commission.          Everything.            Everything?            Lydia! It's your turn!          Lydia moves to go.           People kept saying Wickham owed them          money, it was so tedious. So Darcy          settled his debts but I don't really like          him, do you?          Lizzie pulls her back.           But why did he do it?            I don't know, do I? Anyway you're not to          tell because it's supposed to be our          uncle who paid, and he wouldn't have          • minded paying, either, because I'm his          favorite.                                                                                                               • She leaves. Giggles and shrieks from the croquet lawn.          Elizabeth looks blank with shock.           Close on Darcy's grimly determined face. Drawing back, we          see that he is walking down a street in Mayfair. He          arrives at a house, pauses, and rings the bell. The door          is opened.           Mr Darcy.           I have some business with Mr Bingley.          Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes          slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor          window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and          bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley          looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We          witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has          wronged Jane Bennet.            Lydia and Wickham are leaving. Mr Bennet stands at a          distance. Mrs Bennet sobs as Lydia climbs onto the          carriage.           Write to me often, my dear'.          Wickham takes his leave of Elizabeth.           Please relay my affections to the Darcy's          on your next acquaintance. I am sure he          will be pleased to hear things have          worked out so well.          He joins Lydia.           (through the window)          Married women never have much time for          writing. My sisters may write to me!          They'll have nothing else to do.          The Mrs Bennet and the girls watch as the carriage drives          away.                                                                                                                  Oh there is nothing so bad as parting          with ones children! One seems so forlorn          without them.           That is the consequence of marrying a          daughter. It must make you better          satisfied that your other four are          single.           Elizabeth and Jane are out shopping with their mother and          sisters. Their housekeeper, Mrs Hill, comes out of the          butchers shop.           Did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley          is returning to Netherfield.          A stunned silence. Lizzie glances at Jane. She blushes.           Mr Bingley?          Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop.           Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch Of pork,          for she expects him tomorrow.           Tomorrow?           Not that I care about it. Mr Bingley is          nothing to us and I'm sure I never want          to see him again.           No, we shall not mention a word about it.          (comes back to Mrs Hill)          Is it quite certain he is coming?           Yes, madam. I believe he is alone; his          sister remains in town.           Huh! Come along, girls.          Their mother goes into the draper's shop. Jane pauses at          the threshold.                                                                                                                  It's all right, Lizzie. I'm just glad          that he comes alone, because then we          shall see less of him.           Not that I'm afraid of myself, but I          dread other people's remarks.          A brave smile. Lizzie, of course, is not convinced in the          slightest. They go into the shop.           Mr Bingley rides towards Longbourn, a look of slight          trepidation in his eyes. Darcy now comes into view riding          along side him. They cross the moat bridge.           Mary is practising her scales. Jane and Elizabeth are          sitting at their work, with their mother. Kitty rushes          in.           He is here! He is here, he's at the door!            Oh my goodness! Everybody act naturally.          Jane completely freezes. Everybody else goes into a          fluster.           Whatever you do, do not appear          overbearing.          Kitty looks out through a window.           Look. There's someone with him. Mr whats          his name. The pompous one from before.          Elizabeth looks through the window at Darcy, her heart          leaps to her mouth.           Mr Darcy indeed! The very insolence of          0 0 it. What does he think of coming here?          Elizabeth returns to her seat and sits down, heavily. Mrs          Bennet hurries over to Jane and pinches her cheeks.           Mama!                                                                                                                • (to Mary - who is still           Stop that and sit down! Find yourself          some work! Oh Lord.          They sit there, frozen, pretending to sew. The drawing          room door opens and Mrs Hill shows in the two men. They          bow. Bingley smiles warmly at Jane, who blushes.          Elizabeth glances at Darcy. His face is strained. Mrs          Bennet is all smiles for Bingley. She ignores Darcy.           How very glad we are to see you, Mr          Bingley! There are a great many changes          since you went away. Miss Lucas is          married and settled. And one of my own          daughters too, you will have seen it in          the papers though it was not put in as it          ought to have been. Very short, nothing          about her family.            I did hear of it, and offer my          congratulations.           - but it's very hard to have my Lydia          taken away from me. Mr Wickham has been          transferred to Newcastle, where ever that          is. Thank heaven he has some friends.          Mrs Bennet shoots a frosty glance at Mr Darcy. This is          more than Elizabeth can bare.           Do you hope to stay long in the country,          Mr Bingley?           Just a few weeks. For the shooting.           When you have killed all your own birds,          Mr Bingley, I beg you will come here and          shoot as many as you please.           Thank you -           - Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to          oblige you, and will save all the best of          • the covies for you.                                                                                                                 Excellent.           Are you well, Mr Darcy?           Quite well, thank you.           Well, I hope the weather stays fine, for          your sport.           I return to town tomorrow.            So soon?           My Jane looks well, does she not?          Mr-Bingley stands up abruptly.           She does indeed. Well, I must be going, I          suppose. Darcy -          Darcy cannot quite believe it. He gives Bingley a harsh          stare, Bingley has not completed his task.           It was very pleasant to see you all          again. Elizabeth, Miss Jane..          Bingley can almost not bear to look Jane in the eye as he          acknowledges them all very briefly and bolts for the          door. Mrs Bennet fusses around him.           You must come again. For when you were in          town last winter you promised to take a          family dinner with us. I have not forgot          you see. At least three courses.          Bingley and Darcy take their leave, leaving the Bennets          sitting in silence all looking at once another. Kitty is          fit to burst out laughing, Elizabeth and Jane horrified          by the awkward visit.           • Bingley is pacing backwards and forwards in despair          muttering to himself. Darcy looks at him in extreme          frustration.                                                                                                                Oh damn, damn, buggery, damn.           What were you thinking of?          It's as if Bingley has not heard. He keeps pacing up and          down.           Damn and blast, oh buggery, damn.           The girls are now spread around the room. Jane in.          despair.           Well, I'm glad that's over. We can now          meet as indifferent acquaintances.            Oh yes? Jane, take care.           You cannot think me so weak as to be in           danger now.           I think you are in great danger of making          him as much in love with you as ever.           I'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr          Darcy.            Oh Jane, I have acted so stupidly. Had I          been in love, I could not have been more          blind!            What do you mean?          The door bell rings.           (at the window)          It is him. He's back. He's come again.          • A stunned reaction.                                                                                                                Everyone has regained their decorous positions. They hear           Bingley's voice at the door and he comes in very          awkwardly. He smiles. His face is crimson with          embarrassment.           I, erm, I know this is all very          embarrassing, but I would like to request          the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane -          They all look at him.           - alone.           Girls. Everybody to the kitchen.          Immediately. Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so          good to see you again so soon.          She ushers everyone out, not before squeezing Jane's          hand. Now Jane and Bingley are alone, facing each other          with extreme embarrassment.           Miss Bennet, you have been the victim of          a huge misunderstanding. Suffice to say,          I have been an unmitigated and          comprehensive ass. And therefore, I would          like to ask you -            Mrs Bennet, Kitty, Mary and Mr Bennet are all jostling          for a position at the door in order to overhear events          inside.           Ssssshhh!          Elizabeth is apart from her family. She cannot bear to be          there. She walks down the corridor and out of the house          into the garden. Through a window she sees Bingley on one          knee, her eyes fill with tears as she walks away from the          house.            • Bingley looks at Jane, desperately worried. A pause.                                                                                                               • Yes. A hundred times - yes.          Mrs Bennet and the girls throw open the double doors to          the drawing room and come crashing in. Bingley and Jane          beam at them.           Thank the Lord for that. I thought it          would never happen.           Elizabeth is sat under a tree crying.           Darcy looks down at Longbourn.           Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet are in bed.           I am sure they will do well together,           their tempers are much alike. They will          be cheated assiduously by their servants,          and be so generous with the rest, they          will always exceed their income.           Exceed their income? He has five thousand          a year! I knew she could not be so          beautiful for nothing.          The camera moves through to another bedroom - where Mary          is reading a book out loud to Kitty - then to yet another            Jane and Elizabeth lie in bed.           He has made me so happy. You know, he. was          totally ignorant of my being in town last          spring!           How did he account for it?            He thought me indifferent!                                                                                                               Unfathomable.           No doubt poisoned by his pernicious          sister.           Bravo! That is the most unforgiving          speech you've ever made.           Oh Lizzie, if I could but see you so          happy. If there were such another man for          you!          There is a noise outside.           Perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may          meet with another Mr Collins in time.          What is that?          More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud          banging on the door downstairs. The girls look at each          other.           Mr Bennet, Mrs Bennet and the girls lit by only candles          have gathered. The door bangs again.           Maybe he's changed his mind.          Timidly, Mr Bennet opens the door revealing a wide-eyed          Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Everyone gasps.           Lady Catherine!          Lady Catherine does not acknowledge her, but comes in          uninvited, inspecting the assembled company of aghast          Bennets.           (to Mrs Bennet)          And these are your daughters, I suppose.           All but one, the youngest has been lately          married your ladyship. And my eldest was          only proposed to yesterday afternoon.            You have a very small garden, madam.                                                                                                                • I am sure it is nothing compared to          Rosings, but it is larger than Sir          William Lucas's, I can assure you.            Could I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps?           Absolutely not! I must speak to Miss          Elizabeth alone, as a matter of complete          urgency.          The Bennets all look at each other"", bewildered by this          strange turn of events.           Elizabeth leads the way into the drawing room - lights an          oil lamp. Lady Catherine walks in. The door closes behind          them.           You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to          understand why I am`here.          • Lit only by the oil lamp Lady Catherine resembles a          flickering ghoul.           Indeed you are mistaken. I can not          account for this honour at all.           Miss Bennet, I warn you, I am not to be          trifled with. A report of a most alarming          nature has reached me that you intend to          be united with my nephew, Mr Darcy.          Elizabeth stares at her, amazed.           I know this to be a scandalous falsehood,          though not wishing to injure him by          supposing it possible, I instantly set          off to make my sentiments known.           If you believed it impossible, I wonder          you took the trouble of coming so far.           To hear it contradicted, Miss Bennet.                                                                                                                 Your coming here will be rather a          confirmation, surely, if indeed such a          report exists.           If? Do you then pretend to be ignorant of          it? Has it not been industriously          circulated by yourself?           I have never heard of it.           And can you declare there is no          foundation for it?           I do not pretend to possess equal          frankness with your ladyship. You may ask          the questions, which I may not choose to          answer.           This is not to be borne. Has my nephew          made you an offer of marriage?            Your Ladyship declared it to be          impossible.           Let me be understood. Mr Darcy is engaged          to my daughter. Now what have you to say?           Only this - if that is the case you can          have no reason to suppose he will make an          offer to me.           Oh obstinate girl! This union has been          planned since their infancy. Do you think          it can be prevented by a young woman of          inferior birth, of no importance in the          world and wholly unallied to his family?          Whose own sister's elopement resulted in          the scandalously patched-up marriage,          only achieved at the expense of your          uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades          of Pemberly to be thus polluted? Now tell          me once and for all, are you engaged to          him?            I am not.                                                                                                                And will you promise never to enter into          such an engagement?           I will not. And I certainly never shall.          Allow me to say, the arguments which you          have supported this extraordinary          application have been as frivolous as the          application was ill-judged. You have,          insulted me in every possible method and          can now have nothing further to say. I          must ask you to leave immediately. Good          night.          Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family          outside.           I have never been thus treated in my          entire life.          Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the          night. Elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement          of having stood so firmly up for herself.           Lizzie, what on earth is going on?            Just a small misunderstanding.          She walks past them to bed.           Lizzie!           For once in your life. Just leave me          alone.          Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction.           Jane is fast asleep. Elizabeth unable to sleep. She          quietly climbs out of bed and creeps out of the room.           Elizabeth sits alone downstairs, thinking. Outside we see          dawn is breaking.                                                                                                                 Elizabeth creeps out into the garden and wanders around          through the early morning mist, as the sun starts to          rise.           Elizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists          are starting to evaporate. From out of the mist in the          distance a figure emerges. Her heart misses a beat. She          is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy.           Mr Darcy!           What are you doing out here so early?           I could not sleep.           Me neither. I have been up.most of the          night.           Elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected          meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy.           Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your          unexampled generosity to both my sisters.          I know what kindnesses you have done for          poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the          happy resolution for Jane also.           I am alarmed that you know of what I have          been so in earnest to keep silent. But          you must know that your happiness was one          of my prime inducements.          Elizabeth looks at Darcy.           I know you are too generous to trifle          with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt          last night, and it has taught me to hope          as I had scarcely allowed myself before.          If your feelings are still what they were          last April, tell me so at once. My          affections and wishes are unchanged, but           one word from you will silence me          forever.                                                                                                               Elizabeth is silent.            If, however, your feelings have          changed...          Elizabeth gazes at him.           I would have to tell you, you have          bewitched me body and soul and I love and          love and love you. And never wish to be          parted from you from this day on.          Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is          staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's          cheek.           I am very happy to inform you that not          only have my sentiments changed there are          no other words which could give me          greater pleasure.          Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very,          very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her          eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the          kiss becomes passionate.           The place is in an uproar. Bingley, Jane, Mary, Kitty, Mr          and Mrs Bennet are all gathered, fretting terribly about          Elizabeth's whereabouts. Through a window we see          Elizabeth lead Darcy along the duck board plank across          the moat. Elizabeth enters the house, everybody starts.           Lizzie, where have you been. We thought          something had happened to you.          Darcy follows Elizabeth in.           Mr Darcy! What on earth are you doing          here?          Elizabeth takes Mr Darcy's hand.           Mr Darcy has come to speak with Papa.          Everyone is stunned.                                                                                                                  Elizabeth paces outside the door of the library, waiting.          After a while Darcy emerges, he gives Elizabeth the          briefest of smiles and leaves the door open. Elizabeth          walks in. Her father is in a state of shock.           Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I          thought you hated the man.           No, Papa.           He is rich, to be sure, and you will have          more fine carriages than Jane. But will          that make you happy?            Have you no other objection than your          belief in my indifference?           None at all. We all know him to be a          proud, unpleasant sort of fellow, but          this would be nothing if you really liked          him.           (tears in her eyes)          I do like him!           I love him! He's not proud. It's I who's          been prejudiced, who didn't realize ...          You don't know him, Papa...if I told you          what he's really like. What he's done.           What has he done?            Darcy, in an agony, paces up and down the lawn. He looks          at the library window.            Mr Bennet stares at his daughter.                                                                                                                Good Lord. I must pay him back.           (shakes her head)          No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't          want it.           We misjudged him, me more than anyone. In          every way,not just in this matter. I've          been so blind. He's been so blind! About          Jane, about so many things. Then so have            You see, he and I are so similiar...we're          both so stubborn...           Oh Papa...          Mr Bennet gazes at his daughter-. He still can't quite          take it in.           You do love him, don't you?          Elizabeth nods.           • Very much.          He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves          his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no          doubt.           I cannot believe that anyone can deserve          you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I          heartily give my consent.          Elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him.           I could not have parted with you, my          Lizzie, to any one less worthy.           Oh thank you!          She starts to rush out.           (calls out after her)          And if any young men come for Mary or          Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at          • leisure.                                                                                                                We move through a vast wedding party, following Elizabeth          and Darcy. We meet all our characters. Lydia and Wickham          are missing. Let everyone have an end.          Darcy and Elizabeth kiss, then Darcy pulls Elizabeth off          into the shadows. We see them disappear into the park.          Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy          and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades          as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past          the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to          Elizabeth and smiles.           Allow me, Mrs Darcy.          He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the          rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by          side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.           How did it begin?           I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or           the look. It was too long ago and I was          in the middle before I knew it had begun.           Now be sincere, did you admire me for my          impertinenc?           For the liveliness of your mind, I did.           You may as well call it impertinence,          though make a virtue of it by all means.          My good qualities are under your          protection, and you are to exaggerate -          them as much as possible. And, in return,          it belongs to me to find occasions for          teasing and quarrelling with you as often          as maybe... and I shall begin directly...          We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and          smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter          and fainter, the sound of music and laughter...

"                                Written by                           Damien Chazelle      A sun-blasted sky. We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after     another...     We're --      Cars are at a standstill. It's a horrific traffic jam.     Morning rush hour. Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the     heat. The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the     distance.     We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after     another...     One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another     sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. We     move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO,     until finally we begin to hear...     ...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN]     We settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing.     The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on     her radio -- then starts SINGING.     Then -- she EXITS her car. Then -- she starts MOVING down the     lane.     One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING     along. Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL-      Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making     use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. Arms     swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts.     We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars,     taking the magic in...     Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles --     and the song comes to a dramatic stop.     Flash title card: A1   We settle on a new car. A 1983 Dodge Riviera. In it is     SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. He's listening to the radio. He's     playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious     Monk's ""Japanese Folk Song"". But he keeps stopping it, over     and over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot.                              Revision                           2. C1   We DRIFT from his car to one further up ahead. A light-green     2005 Prius. Inside is MIA, 27, Nevada-raised. Six years of     ""no"" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer.     She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system.     Fast, fiery, full of energy --                ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked.               It was pure insanity.     Mia stops. Thinks. Mutters to herself: ""Insanity""... Then     leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger     seat. It's a SCRIPT.                       (reading now)               Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...     Just then -- the traffic around Mia starts to let up. She's     too focused on her lines to notice.     Then -- a long, sustained honk behind her: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT.     Mia comes to. Jerked back to reality. The honking car behind     her swerves into the next lane. It's Sebastian. Mia gives him     the finger. We then FOLLOW her as she drives...        Mia works, photos of Hollywood icons on the wall behind her, as --                This doesn't taste like almond milk.                Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --                Can I see the carton?     Mia hands it over. The Customer looks.                I'll have a black coffee.     Mia gets the coffee. Quickly sneaks a look at a script hidden     underneath her counter. The same one we saw in her car...                               Revision                          3.    She hands the coffee to the Customer. We follow the Customer    out through the door -- as a WOMAN walks into the shop. We    don't see the Woman's face, but we see all the eyes in the    shop turn immediately to her. We see one CUSTOMER whisper to    another, discreetly pointing as the WOMAN passes by...               Cappuccino, please.    Mia nods. Gets it made. The Manager takes it from her.               On us.               No, I insist.    She pays. Then smiles at Mia and drops a bill in the tip jar.    Mia watches as the Woman walks off, is joined by a STUDIO    EMPLOYEE on a golf cart outside -- we realize this coffee shop    is on a STUDIO LOT -- and is driven away...    Then -- Mia's phone rings. It reads: ""MOM"". Mia presses    ""IGNORE"" and the time pops up on the phone's screen: 4:07.               Shit.    Removing her apron and hurrying out, turning back as --               Where do you think you're going?               It's -- five past...               You'd better be here early tomorrow.               Ok.    -- then realizes she doesn't have her script, runs back to    grab it, hurries on and then -- CRASHES into a table. Coffee    and food spill all over her shirt, and all at once we're --     Mia's in a thick winter coat, covering her stained shirt. On    her cell, loudly laughing while her adrenaline surges --               And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It              was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...                                Revision                      4.    Her nerves are practically visible. As she talks, we PULL    BACK -- to see that she's auditioning for a CASTING DIRECTOR.               No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you              waiting `til Denver to tell her...?                     (as her smile contracts)              Oh. I see...                     (silence; she clenches her jaw...)              No, you're right. I understand.                     (...and a tear falls from her eye)              Ok... I just... Oh...    An ASSISTANT appears through the glass on the door behind    Mia, waving to the Casting Director: Yoohoo. Can I come in?                      (crying now)              No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --               One second.    Mia stops. The Casting Director waves the Assistant in. The    Assistant scurries in, shows her boss a post-it. Mia stands    there, trying to hold onto the tears, hold onto the emotion, as    the Casting Director reads the post-it and thinks.               ...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost              done in here.    The Assistant nods. Walks out. Mia waits, trying to maintain...               You know what? I think we're good. Thanks              for coming in.    Mia looks at her. A beat.     Mia exits. Nerves still on edge. Passes one beautiful redhead    after the next -- all getting ready to cry.    Enters the elevator with two other WOMEN -- tall, statuesque.    Also redheads.     Mia enters. Exhausted. Heads to her ROOM.                             Revision                          5.    Old movie posters hang on the walls, including a big Ingrid    Bergman one over the bed. There's also a shelf filled with    acting books -- Uta Hagen, Stella Adler. Various other    trinkets: an old globe, an old blue-and-red suitcase. Mia    takes off her shoe. A blister on her sole.8   WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a    towel. She hums to herself.    The mirror is fogged up. She turns off the vent. The mist on    the glass thickens. She dabs some of it away. Dims the    lights. Looks...    With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those    soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. She hums as she brushes    her hair...    Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken.               Holy Mother of God.    Mia snaps out of it. Turns. Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27.               Ever heard of a vent?               I wanted to give you an entrance.                      (appearing in the hall, 26,                      eating Cheetos)              Mia! How'd it go?               Eh...               Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?               I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.               They're the worst.               I don't know if they were there.    As Mia slips away --               I bet they were.                               Revision                           6.                       (appearing, 27)               Why is there a convention in the bathroom?                Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming,               right?     WE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom --                Can't. Working.                What?                      (we PAN BACK to Tracy)               Did she say ""working""?A8   We follow Mia INSIDE her room. She closes the door. Takes a     moment. You can tell in her eyes -- work or not, a night on     the town is the last thing she wants to do now.B8   WE CUT to the HALLWAY, to find Tracy POUNDING on Mia's door.                        (opening up)               Yes?                Look, I know things didn't go well today.               There are four things in my inbox that               you're perfect for and I will submit you.               But right now -- you're coming.C8   With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet --                It'll be fun.                It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed               into one of those glass houses.                Exactly. Fun.     She pulls out a blue dress. As Alexis hurries in --      This looks familiar.             I was going to give it                                      back!     Alexis moves from Mia's perfume to the dress, lighting up as     she grabs it --                               Revision                           7.                 Come on, Mia. When else do you get to                see every Hollywood clich� crammed                into a single home?                        (faux-offended)                Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's                nothing to make fun of. This party will                be humanity at its finest.      Mia rolls her eyes -- and, with that --      Tracy BREAKS INTO SONG. [SOMEONE IN THE CROWD]      She play-acts the clich�s this party will represent. Alexis      and Caitlin join in, giddy and playful. Mia can't help but      laugh. The roommates sing and dance, hoping to persuade Mia      to join the night's revelry...      Mia remains reluctant. Stays behind in her room as her      roommates head out the door. But she's starting to wonder: A      night at home, feeling sorry for herself -- or a night out      with her friends...?       We're outside now, and BACK with Tracy, Alexis and Caitlin,      marching across the courtyard and toward the street. They      sing, dance, half-assuming Mia is a no-go --      -- until Mia APPEARS, blue-dress-clad. Her roommates look at      her in surprise -- then delight. The energy swells and the      four characters dance their way together down the street.      They dive into a single CAR, and WE DISSOLVE TO...         An old-fashioned MONTAGE of a night on the town: neon signs      and overflowing champagne glasses. Soon enough, we're at...       Valet cars lined up. We FOLLOW Alexis, Tracy, Caitlin and Mia      to the door...       ...and into a big-glass hilltop pad. We FOLLOW Mia as she      takes in her surroundings.                                 Revision                          8.      A D.J. turning tables. A FAT OLD PRODUCER dancing with a      TWENTY-SOMETHING. A trio of AGENTS glad-handing each other in      rhythm by the bar. Yep -- every clich� is here...      Mia tries talking to a pair of WOMEN -- who promptly ditch      her.      Seeing she's now alone, a YOUNG MAN swoops in to hit on her.      She makes a hasty exit toward the bar -- but the line's      obscenely long.      She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way,      making out.      She slips in behind them...A13   Inside the BATHROOM, Mia takes a moment. The joy of seconds      ago is gone from her eyes now. She gazes into the mirror --      -- and SINGS by herself.      This verse, sung in private, belongs to a new style: less      brash, and far more vulnerable...      Once finished, Mia takes a breath, steels herself to once      again face the world, opens the door -- and rejoins the      crowd...B13   We MOVE with her slowly now -- surrounded by the party, but      everything set at a snail's pace, the crazed carousers moving      in SLOW MOTION. It's the sadness underneath the revelry, the      pain underneath the clich�s...      Gradually we RAMP UP. Follow Mia OUTSIDE, where we see the      splash of blue-green that is the POOL -- and a flurry of FAKE      SNOW falling from above...      As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps --      -- and we PLUNGE WITH HIM INTO THE POOL.      This is the climax of the number. Everyone joins in,      circling the pool -- a swath of color against the black sky.      Everyone dances, everyone sings -- and the song concludes      with a blast of fireworks.        Close on a sign: ""NO PARKING ANYTIME: TOW-AWAY ZONE"".                                  Revision                      9.                 No...      We see Mia -- all alone, staring at the sign. No car in      sight. She reaches into her purse, pulls out her cell phone      to call Tracy. It's dead.                 No...             Mia trudges down the steep hill in her unwieldy heels. She's an      hour-and-a-half walk from her place. She crosses roads and lots,      navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to      shrubbery.A19   And then -- she hears something... Music. A piano, in the      distance. And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well...      Without being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several      doors. Then stops. Has found where it's coming from...      She reaches out -- and slowly opens a door...        AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. The same 101 traffic jam we began      with. This time we're on Sebastian -- the honker.      He passes Mia's car. She gives him the finger. He drives on,      shaking his head...        Sebastian sips a coffee as he gazes across the street -- at      a 30's Deco building. A sign above the door: ""VAN BEEK"". A      newer sub-heading below: ""TAPAS & TUNES"".                               Revision                          10.      The door opens. Two EMPLOYEES step out, setting up a valet      stand. Sebastian watches them -- and shakes his head. The      employees notice him. Recognize him. What is it with that      guy...?        Sebastian enters his apartment -- cramped, dingy, bare      walls, no furniture or decoration, boxes filled with dusty      black-and-white photographs and unused instruments on the      floor, a black Steinway upright piano in the center of the      living room -- and sees a WOMAN rummaging around.                 You gotta stop breaking into my home.      She looks up. She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like      she doesn't care. This is LAURA, Sebastian's older sister.                 You think Mom or Dad would call this a                home?      Seeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool --                 Please don't sit on that.                 Are you serious?                 Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool.                The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.                 I wonder why.                       (then, rising,)                I brought you this. It's a throw rug.                 Don't need it.                 Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis                pissed on it?                 That's almost insulting...                       (then,)                Did he?                         Revision                        11.She shakes her head: Unbelievable. Tosses the rug to the side.           When are you going to unpack these boxes?           When I unpack them in my club.           Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with          you and you're stalking her.                 (then, looks at him --)          You're not still going by there, are you?           No.A beat. Then --           They've turned it into a tapas-samba          place. You believe that?           Seb --           Who wants to tapas while they samba?           I have someone I want you to meet.           I don't want to meet anyone.           You'll like her.           Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?           Probably not.           Then what are we gonna talk about?           You'll talk about the weather.           Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to          meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart          of gold.                           Revision                      12.           Sebastian --           How long's it been?           You need to get serious. You live like a          hermit. You're driving without insurance.           I am serious. I had a very serious plan          for my future. It's not my fault I got          Shanghai'ed.           You did not get ""Shanghai'ed"", you got          ripped off.           What's the difference?           It's not as romantic as that.                 (she starts to walk off)          And everyone knew that guy was shady          except for you.           Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty          word?           Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.She heads to the door. He follows her, won't give it up --           You're acting like life's got me on the          ropes -- what you don't understand is, I          want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life          hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna          make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope.Laura can't help but laugh. Stops by the door. Looks at him.           I love you. Unpack your boxes.           I'm changing the locks.                                  Revision                       13.                        (out the door with a smile --)                You can't afford it.      She's gone. Sebastian thinks for a beat, then calls out --                 I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes!      No reply to his triumphant declaration. He shuts the door.      Looks again at the napkin. Thinks. Tosses it in the trash.       Moments later. Sebastian takes a slice of pizza from the      fridge, pours himself some more coffee, places a Thelonious      Monk LP onto a record player, and sits down at the piano.      ""Japanese Folk Song"" -- the piece we heard in his car --      plays...      Sebastian plays along. Stops. Moves the record back a few      bars. Starts it again. Plays the same passage over. Stops.      Moves the record back a second time. Plays the passage again.      Stops. Over and over, just like in his car -- until, finally,      he gets it right.      He keeps playing, louder now, and we're --           A red-booth bar-and-restaurant. Christmas decorations all over.      Sebastian steps in. Immediately beelining over --                 Seb.                        (putting on a smile)                Bill. Thanks for having me back.                 Your welcome. Stick to the set list.                               Revision                       14.                Of course.                      (under his breath as he heads                       to the piano)               Though I don't think they care what I               play.                I do, and I don't want to hear the free               jazz.                How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two               for you, one for me?                      (the Boss just glares)               Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that               works. Good deal.     Sebastian sits down at the keys. A WAITRESS passes by.                Well... Welcome back.                There's a nice way to say that.     With that -- he starts playing ""Jingle Bells"".      The restaurant's demographic has changed. It's now younger     stragglers wandering in. Sebastian looks beyond bored. He     finishes ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"". Zero applause.     He begins a new chart: ""Deck the Halls"". But something seems     to come over him now. He's restless. Slowly, his playing     drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path...     And then -- we hear a melody. The one Mia heard outside. The     one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song...     The door opens -- and Mia steps in. She sees Sebastian at the     piano. Is instantly struck by his playing. [MIA AND      Gradually -- all sounds but the music drop out. We drift away     from reality. Even the walls seem to go slightly darker -- as     though Sebastian and Mia were all alone... He concludes his     piece with a jumble of chords, his playing almost free jazz     now, as we pull back to real life...     ...and see the Boss looking on in scorn.                         Revision                        15.Sebastian finishes. Silence. Mia looks like the wind has beenknocked out of her. Sebastian looks up for a second -- andsees her. They look at one another. Just a moment.Then -- the Boss taps Sebastian on the shoulder. WE STAY ONMia as she watches Sebastian rise with the Boss. We just seethe Boss talking to Sebastian, can't hear what is said. Then,we get closer -- and realize:           ...every goddamned night.Sebastian is silent. Then, doesn't want to have to beg but --           I'll stick to the set list, I promise --           Too late. You're done.           You're not gonna find a better player. You          know that.                  (leans in, and --)          Do you think anyone here gives a shit?With that, the Boss walks off. We linger on Sebastian. Angergiving way -- to hurt. He starts hurrying toward the door.BACK TO Mia -- who didn't hear what was said. She watchesSebastian -- takes a breath, so moved that she's about to layit all out -- swoops in to corner him -- and --           I just wanted to say -- I saw your          playing, and I ---- but Sebastian just walks right by -- his shoulderbumping against Mia's for an added measure of disdain.He heads out the door. Slams it shut. Mia is left standing onher own. She looks like she's just been slapped.                                  Revision                         16.        Mia auditions. Pilot season cattle-call -- a series of soul-     crushing try-outs. She's pandering to the hilt. Quick glimpses:                I don't like the fissure on the GT scan.               Did you test for achromatopsia?31   Then, a second audition --                D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off               at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights.32   And finally, a third audition --                This is my classroom. You don't like it,               the door's to my left.                       (a well-dressed forty-year-old                       WOMAN reading from sides)               Lady why you be trippin' like that?                No, Jamal. You be trippin'.      Mia wanders around another party. A BAD 80's COVER BAND plays.                There you are! You need to meet someone!               Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer.      Nice to meet you, Mia.          He's got projects all over                                     town.                       (shrugs, faux-modest)               They say I have a knack for world-building.                       (takes this in; then --)               Congratulations. I have to grab a drink...                              Revision                        17.     She slips away. Presses toward the bar. The music gets louder,     more obnoxious. She peers toward the band to get a look...     And then she sees him. Sebastian.     Playing keyboard-guitar for the band. Dressed up like his band-     mates in a bright polyester outfit. And hating every second.     The band finishes, and the SINGER addresses the (thin) crowd.                Alright, one more for y'all before we               break. Do I hear any requests?                ""I Ran"".     Sebastian turns. Sees Mia, looking at him with a defiant grin,     enjoying her power. He thinks -- then recognizes the face.                ""I Ran"" it is.                      (to Sebastian)               Wanna start us off, piano-man?     Sebastian stays silent. Mortified. Finally, so reluctant, he     taps his keyboard to count the band in and begins playing.     On the keys, it's a single note, repeated measure after measure.     Mia knew this. Sebastian looks at her. She smiles right back.                I walked along the avenue...      Set break. Sebastian hurries from the keys -- enters the house,     looks both ways, finally spots Mia and --                Ok. I remember you.     Mia looks at him. One eyebrow raised. Yeah?                And I'm sorry if I was curt that night.                ""Curt""?                Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that.                          Revision                       18.           Ok.           But requesting ""I Ran"" from a serious          musician -- it's too far.           My God. Did you just call yourself ""a          serious musician""?                  (beat)          I don't think so.           Can I borrow what you're wearing?           Why?           Because I have an audition next week. I'm          playing a serious fire-fighter.                  (irritation building --)          So you're an actress. That makes sense.          Have I seen you in anything?           Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner          Brothers lot. That's a classic.           Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how          you can look down on me from all the way          up there.                  (popping in from nowhere)          Sebastian. Second set.Sebastian looks at Mia. She smirks. Pleased. The Singer walksoff.           He doesn't tell me what to do.           He just told you what to do.           I let him.                              Revision                          19.     A beat.                What's your name?                Mia.                Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies.     He heads back to the keys, and the band resumes:                Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you               did tonight...      The party's finished. Sebastian exits, pulling out his keys,     as we DRIFT and see a long line to the VALET. Standing way in     the back, waiting, is Mia. She's stuck once again with CARLO,     who's regaling her --                ...Goldilocks from the point of view of               the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox               and Warners are going crazy for it.     Mia spots Sebastian, passing by the Valet with his keys.                ...We're going after Charlize. For the               bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a               franchise. But the thing is it's grounded.                       (to Sebastian)               George Michael!     Sebastian stops. Looks at her. Surprised.                You again.                Did you just get your keys?     Sebastian thinks. Sees the Valet. Playing it off --                ...Yeah.                               Revision                       20.                Can you grab mine?                ...Which one is it?                The Prius.     A beat. Sebastian turns to the Valet's box. Motions to the     Valet: Sorry. One second. Looks. All the keys are Prius keys.                The one with the green ribbon.     Another beat. Sebastian finds it. Grabs it.      Mia and Sebastian trudge up a hill lined with cars. Mia aims     her key fob. No beep. Sebastian points his own keys, also     aiming for a beep. Silence. They've been at this for a while.                       (almost tripping in her heels)               Shit...                Those look comfortable.                They are...n't.     A beat. She aims again. No beep.                Thank you for saving the day back there.                You didn't give me much of a choice.                Strange that we keep running into each               other.                It is strange. Maybe it means something.                I doubt it.                Yeah I don't think so either.                         Revision                        21.On that, Mia aims again. As always -- no beep. Noticing --           Put the clicker under your chin.           What?Sebastian demonstrates with his fob. He looks idiotic.           It turns your head into an antenna.          Probably gives you cancer, but you find          your car more quickly.           Uh-huh.           You don't live as long, but you get          things done faster, so it all evens out.           Oh my God.Just then, they reach a clearing -- AND THE CITY SKYLINEAPPEARS BELOW. A ribbon of lights, stretching as far as youcan see. It's the most romantic sight imaginable. They lookat each other. A beat. And then --           Eh.They walk on, the lights shimmering behind.           Not much to look at.           Agreed. I've seen better.And on that -- they SING. [A LOVELY NIGHT]Mia and Sebastian try to downplay the romanticism of thissetting, this moment -- being lost here, at night, alonetogether, atop a hill, the city glittering before them. It's""no big deal"", nothing they haven't seen or felt before --because, after all, there's no chance for romance betweenthem...Of course, the music, swelling and building, suggestsotherwise. Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishesfor flats in her handbag. Sebastian sits beside her as sheslips the flats on. They look at each other, suspicious...                         Revision                        22.He moves his foot. She moves hers. They look at each otheragain. Still suspicious...He moves again. She moves again. They seem to be moving insync -- without their even wanting to...And -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almostslipped into DANCE...Sebastian rises. Mia rises as well. The two look at eachother. Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lightsstretch out like a magic carpet. They share a moment -- sharea look -- jump off -- AND START REALLY DANCING NOW...Mia does a move, Sebastian responds. Sebastian does a move, Miashakes her head: ""Nope"". They make the road their own, growingmore and more energized, as surprised as we are to find --...that they can really dance together.Just as this starts to look like a blossoming romance, realjoy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closerand closer, looking at each other almost giddily......a sound cuts through. It's a CELL PHONE ring.Mia and Sebastian turn -- to her handbag, back by the bench.Snapped out of it, Mia heads over and pulls out her cell.           Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah,          I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon...She hangs up. Looks at Sebastian. An awkward silence. Finally --she presses her fob again. Puts it under her chin this time. ABEEP can be heard. They see her Prius.           Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride          to your car?           No, that's fine... Thanks...           ...Ok...Not sure what else to say, she heads to her vehicle. Waves.           Night.Sebastian waves back. Mia drives off. Fast. Silence...                                 Revision                        23.      Looking even more disappointed than he thought he'd be,      Sebastian walks on for a bit -- then retreats back down.A37   Comes to a stop across from the party, and we see his Riviera --      right, it seems, where he knew it was all along. He pulls out      his keys -- they don't have a clicker after all.        CLOSE on --                 Are these pastries gluten-free?      Mia's at work. A typically chaotic day.                 No...                 What?? I want a refund.      Mia nods, heads to the Manager --                 You're closing up Friday.                 I have an audition. Remember?                 Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.                 But you said --                 And fix your apron.      With that, the Manager walks off. Mia is silent for a moment      -- wants to talk back but needs this job -- then turns -- and      sees Sebastian at the counter.                 ...Hi.                       (then)                What are you doing here?                 Meetings. Studio heads.                               Revision                       24.                Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?                Piece of cake.     Mia looks at him. He's sweating through his shirt. A beat.                Actually it took me four hours and I               ended up running. We probably have twenty               minutes before the guy finds me. You got               a break coming up?     Mia laughs. A moment.                I'm off in ten.                Great. I'll hide in the bathroom.      Mia exits, apron off. She and Sebastian start walking. She points     across the street -- to the fa�ade of a Parisian apartment.                That's the window Ingrid Bergman and               Humphrey Bogart looked out of in               Casablanca.     Sebastian nods. They start walking.                What's your Bogart's name...?                      (Mia looks at him)               Is it Greg?                Yeah. Greg.                How long have...?                We've been seeing each other for a few               months.     An awkward beat. They pass a wooden SALOON -- where a WESTERN     is being shot. Extras in COWBOY costumes drink coffee on the     steps.                         Revision                        25.           I love this stuff. Makes coming to work          easier.           I know what you mean. I get breakfast          five miles out of the way just to sit          outside a jazz club.           Oh yeah?           It was called Van Beek. The swing bands          played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb.                 (then,)          It's a samba-tapas place now.           A what?           Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on          history.Mia laughs.           Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything          and they value nothing.They reach a patch of green. Another shoot. A P.A. yells out:           Clear the frame!                  (to Sebastian)          We need to wait here.           I know. They shoot movies on my street.          ""C-stands."" ""Apple box."" ""Don't forget to          sign out.""Mia laughs. A beat.           Quiet on set!Mia and Sebastian watch the cameras roll. Then, in a whisper --           How'd you get into all this?                               Revision                          26.                 Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an                actress. She was in this traveling                theater company... And there was this                little library across the street from my                house when I was growing up. This was                Boulder City, Nevada -- every house                looked exactly the same. I was ten and                already I needed to get out. And one day,                my aunt flew into town, and she showed me                the library's old-movie section. We spent                a whole day watching one after the other.                Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca.                       (a beat; then,)                I never knew the world was so big.                 Cut!      Mia and Sebastian resume walking. Now, at full volume --                 I started putting on plays in my garage.                I'd write the scripts and print up                programs, and she'd give me props to use                from wherever she'd just been -- New                York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet                off again and I wouldn't hear from her                for another year.                 Who would you invite to watch? Your                parents?                 God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That                would have been terrifying.C40   CUT TO: The entrance to a giant soundstage.                 Honestly, I wish I loved something else.                I've tried so hard to want other things.      She and Sebastian stop. Peer inside the stage.                 I left school after two years to come here,                my fourth manager just dropped me, and my                last audition was for a teen soap pitched                as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.                       (a beat; then, deadpan --)                Should've been a lawyer.                               Revision                        27.      They resume walking.D40   CUT TO: A row of closed soundstages, sandy-tan against the      bright blue sky.                 ...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.                 Well it doesn't need more actresses.                 You're not just an actress.                 What do you mean, ""just an actress""?                 You said it yourself, you're a child-                prodigy playwright.                 That is not what I said.                 You're too modest to say it but it's                true. So you could write your own roles.                Write something that's as interesting as                you are.                 Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine                for an open-mic night. It was horrible.                 All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong                could have played the marching-band                charts he was given. What did he do                instead? He made history.                 Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make                history instead.      Sebastian laughs.                 Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's                something I should tell you...                 Yeah?                                Revision                       28.                I hate jazz.     Sebastian stops. Turns to her.                What does that mean? ""I hate jazz""?                It means when I listen to it I don't like               it.                But it's such a blanket statement. It's               like saying ""I hate animals"".                I do hate some animals.                Do you need to be anywhere right now?     Mia looks at him. We hear DRUMS. A swinging ride pattern. And     we're in --      -- an old-school JAZZ CLUB. It's almost empty, only aged JAZZ     CATS here -- except for Mia and Sebastian, watching a QUARTET...                Most people say they hate jazz because               they don't have context. They don't get               where it came from. All these people               packed into flophouses in New Orleans,               speaking five different languages, and               jazz was how they talked to each other.                I thought it was just Kenny G.                ...What?     Mia looks at him. Already knows just how to get to him.                I associate it with facials. It's               relaxing.                It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a               gunfight `cause somebody told him he               played a wrong note!                         Revision                           29.                  (laying it on thick)          Right, but it's good to talk over. Where          I grew up there's this jazz station          they'd play at cocktail parties whenever          they served the salami and cheese.           Mia. These are things you can't unsay.She bursts into laughter. Sebastian points to the band --           It's not cocktail music -- it's a high-          wire act. These guys are performing and          composing and rearranging all at once.A beat. Mia looks at the band. We DRIFT over the instruments...           That's why you need to be in the space          and see what's at stake. This whole thing          -- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll          head off to cut commercial sessions or do          pit at the Pantages `cause they have to --          but when I have my own place -- my club --          they'll play whatever they want.Mia looks at Sebastian. Her laughter has subsided. She cansee something in him now -- the same passion he's speaking of...           Your club?           ...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm          getting the lease back. It'll be perfect.He watches the band. Lost in the sound. Then -- sincere --           The world tells everyone to move on. Says          the music's had its moment. But I love it          too much. I'm not moving on.The band finishes. The ride cymbal sizzles in the air...           So?He looks at Mia. She's visibly moved.Just then -- we hear a BEEP. Mia looks at her phone.                                Revision                      30.                 Hi, I just missed a call...      Mia steps out, dazed. Sebastian's listening to a new tune. He     spots Mia, turns to her -- as, shouting over the music --                I got a call-back!                Really? For what?                That show I told you about.                Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?                Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel               Without a Cause.                That's amazing! ""I got the bulletsssss!""     Mia laughs. But Sebastian can tell something in her laugh...                You've seen it, right?                Obviously.                      (a beat; then --)               No.                What? You're the movie person.                It's the one I lie about.                Come on. You can't do this audition and               never see Rebel. The theater near me's               playing it. If you want -- I can take               you. For research.                         (considering this)               ...Ok.                              Revision                          31.                10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?                Ok.                      (another nod, taking it in)               For research.     Mia looks at him -- he looks at her -- each of them     suppressing a newfound giddiness... And on that --      Mia and Sebastian exit. Wave ""good-bye"". We FOLLOW Sebastian.     He rounds the corner, nears the Hermosa Beach pier...     ...and begins to SING. [CITY OF STARS] Lifted by a strange     new feeling -- a feeling he wasn't expecting. The feeling     that perhaps -- just perhaps -- he's falling in love...     He gazes out at the sea, the purple sky. Dances with an OLD     COUPLE, then continues on his way, as though caught in a     dream. There's an uncertainty in his singing -- he's not sure     if this dream will sustain. But for now, it's a beautiful     feeling...     The MUSIC simmers down -- and WE FADE OUT.      A Pasadena building. As Mia approaches the door, another cell     ring. It's her MOM. This time, Mia is happy to get the call:                Hi, Mom!                Hi, sweetie. How are you?                Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.                Oh my God! You're going to be on TV??                Well -- it's not picked up yet.                Not picked up?                First they make the pilot, then if they               like the pilot it goes on TV.                              Revision                           32.                And you're in the pilot?                Well, no, I have a call-back.                I see... Didn't you audition for a TV               thing last week?                It's another audition.                I see... So you might get a role in a               thing that might one day be put on TV...                ...Well when you put it like that it               sounds like a huge accomplishment.                No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting.               What channel? ABC? HBO?                Oxygen.                Oxygen?                You know what, I have to go. I love you.     She hangs up. Takes a deep breath. Enters the building.      Mia sits, starts reviewing her script.     Looks around her -- the room is filled with ACTRESSES silently     MOUTHING THEIR LINES. It's a bizarre sight: a dozen women     moving their mouths, with no sound coming out at all.     What's more, they're all in variations of the same type of     costume: Michelle Pfeiffer's leather jacket from Dangerous     Minds.     A few stare at Mia, sizing her up. In the corner, another     one of them GRUNTS while performing stretches. Then -- a     DOOR to the side opens, and Mia can hear --                ...We'll be seeing you very soon.                              Revision                        33.     An ACTRESS exits. Absolutely beaming. And then, a bored voice --                Mia Dolan?      Mia steps in. The pilot's DIRECTOR is seated at a table,     looking in his folder at Mia's head-shot. He looks up at Mia.                Whenever you're ready.     Mia breathes in. Heart pounding. Sweat percolating. Has been     practicing this for days now.     Fighting her nerves, she begins --                Two options. Follow my rules, or follow               my rules. Kapish? You want to bully,               you'd best be ready to get bullied --                Thanks.     Mia is taken aback.                I can do it another way --                No, thanks, that was great.     We linger on Mia for a moment, and then --      Crestfallen, humiliated, Mia hurries to her car. Sees a voice-     mail on her cell. Plays it --                Dad just helped me find Oxygen on the               guide! So exciting! So will you be               getting health insurance now?     Mia switches her phone off and drives. Clenches her jaw.     Turns left and sees a movie theater. The Rialto. Manages a     smile.     Something she can remain upbeat about...                              Revision                        34.      Mia in her room, sorting through outfits. Slips into jeans --                Mia?     -- then spins around, startled. Alexis is at the door, eating     Fritos. Has been crying.                       (with difficulty)               Greg's here...     Mia looks at Alexis -- completely confused. Then -- Greg steps     out behind Alexis. Waves to her.                Hey... I'm parked out front. But we               should hurry, my brother just landed.     Mia looks at him, still confused. Then remembers.                Did you forget?                Shit. No. Yes. I'll change...                       (smiles)               It's ok.     Mia closes her door -- turns -- and we see her face. She's     crushed. She goes to call Sebastian -- then freezes.     Remembers something else. She never got his number...     We linger on her face, as, on his phone outside her door --                Josh! Yep, just picking Mia up now. Will               be there in twenty.      Sebastian's playing a jam session. Excited, distracted. 10pm     can't come quickly enough.      Mia, in a green dress, with Greg, his brother JOSH, and     Josh's FIANCEE. The restaurant is posh, modern. Josh wears a     Brooks Brothers suit: he seems better-off than his brother.                                Revision                      35.                That's right -- but now we've got a               surround-sound set-up, so it's like --                It's like being in a movie theater.                It's better than going to a theater,               really. You know theaters these days --                Oh, sure --                -- they're so dirty, and they're either               too hot or too cold, and there's always               people talking, which is just --                      (his phone buzzes)               -- just so annoying, I mean you're trying               to watch a movie -- one second --                      (opens phone)               Hello?...     His Fianc�e smiles, looks at Greg and Mia, proud.                Probably work.                Yeah, I'll have to call you back.                      (closes and pockets his phone)               So, yeah, we love it.     Awkward silence. Mia hasn't spoken a word.      Sebastian paces. People shuffle in. He looks. No sign of Mia.      Midway through the meal.     Mia is bored, restless, uneasy.                One word for you. Nicaragua.                I've never heard anyone say that. Was it               amazing?                              Revision                          36.                Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort.               It was unbelievable.     Mia stays quiet, in her own thoughts, the voices around her     fading away. And then she hears it -- coming from the     restaurant speakers, peeking out subtly at first: the melody     we now know so well... Her and Sebastian's song.     She FREEZES. The radio music seems to have morphed into the     melody, and the tune stirs something deep within her...     A few seconds pass. And then she can't deny it any longer.     It's clear as day to her now. She rises from her seat --                Mia?     -- looks at Greg --                I'm sorry.     -- and -- as the sounds of a FULL ORCHESTRA swoop in --     -- RUNS out of the restaurant as fast as she can.      The MUSIC SWELLS, strings carrying us through and lifting     Mia's spirits as she runs down the street in her green dress,     for once absolutely sure of what she's doing...      Inside the Rialto, Sebastian settling into his seat, the show     about to begin. He's visibly disappointed that he's alone. The     lights dim. Projector light cuts through the darkness. And     then, as the movie's credits start up, Sebastian spots, out of     the corner of his eye, a figure in the aisle...     He looks. The figure turns. Looks at him. It's Mia.     And, caught like a freeze-frame in the projector   light, her     green dress incandescent, the giant movie screen   behind her     like a great piece of back-projection, she looks   more beautiful     than ever right now. A true old-fashioned screen   siren.     Sebastian's eyes go wide. He's surprised. And thrilled. He     waves. Mia hurries toward him. Takes the seat next to his,     as Rebel Without a Cause begins...                               Revision                           37.       Half an hour has passed. The movie plays, lights flickering      on Mia and Sebastian's darkened faces.      He puts his arm on the armrest, she moves hers nervously.      He scoots to his right, she scoots back.      She edges her elbow onto the armrest, he moves his arm.      Inch by inch, their bodies grow closer. Hands approaching,      breaths quickening, hearts pounding...      ...until finally their hands touch...      And then, suddenly -- just as James Dean and Natalie Wood      arrive at Griffith Observatory, and Mia and Sebastian seem      about to kiss --      -- burn marks streak their way across the image.      The screen goes blank.      Silence. The lights go on. Mia and Sebastian turn around.      AUDIENCE MEMBERS start murmuring. Sebastian can barely      believe his bad luck.      But then Mia turns to him. Energized.                 I have an idea.       Sebastian's car, traveling up a winding road, stars glittering      above it, the lights of Los Angeles glittering below it. The sky      is a deep, painted blue. Music plays... [PLANETARIUM]      The car is bending around the turns, making its way up to...A57   ...the real Griffith Observatory. There, our MUSIC crests.      Our two characters get out of the car and wander, searching      for an open entrance. They find one -- and sneak in...       They ascend a staircase. Make their way past the exhibits --      the Tesla coil shooting off electric bolts.      They reach the pendulum, gaze up at the mural above it, look at      one another. Circle the pendulum, and then -- so tenderly, so      nervously...                                Revision                          38.      ...they begin to DANCE.      This is a dance that fulfills all the promise in their      earlier duet. They circle the floor, gently and gracefully.      The music BUILDS, and they drift into...A58   ...the PLANETARIUM. It's darkened, empty. Mia removes her      shoes, feels the soft carpet under her feet. Turns on the      projector. The screen STARTS TO GLOW. She and Sebastian take      in the sight -- the STARS and GALAXIES...      Enchanted, they look at one another, the lights from the      screen reflected on their faces. They approach, as though      about to kiss... When --      -- Mia's shoes LIFT UP. Float toward the ceiling -- toward the      star-filled screen. She and Sebastian trade looks. Realize.      And then they too begin to FLOAT...      ...RISING from the floor, nothing stopping them. SOARING      past the views of comets and moons and nebulae. Eyes wide,      their emotions seized, as they HOLD EACH OTHER TIGHT...      And so unspools a gravity-free dance.      Mia and Sebastian SPIN and TWIRL through the planetarium as      though they themselves were in outer space, flying through      the cosmos. The music carries them higher and higher, and      their spirits likewise soar -- JOYOUS, EXUBERANT -- until,      finally...      ...the music SOFTENS.      Mia and Sebastian drift back to the floor like feathers. They      land on a pair of seats.      There, once again seated like audience members at a movie, they      turn and look into each other's eyes. The music picks back up      for the big finish, as the lovers lean in and -- in true movie-      movie old-Hollywood big-musical fashion --       It's their first kiss, and it's a kiss to remember -- full of      all the hope and yearning and terror and wonder of love's first      blush. A swoon-worthy kiss, with the orchestra soaring and the      camera swooping in to catch the embrace in all its glory.      On this triumphant moment...      ...we IRIS FADE OUT.                                 Revision                      39.        Mia's scribbling in a notebook. It's dialogue. We see character      headings, scene headings. Seems to be some kind of a script...                 What's that?      Mia turns. Tracy has wandered in -- pajamas, eating cereal.                 Is that a script?                 It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.                        (chiming in from her bedroom)                A play? You better give us roles!                 Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman                show...      A beat -- and then --       HONKING outside the nearest window. It's a honk we recognize:                 ...Is that gonna happen every time?                        (glowing)                I think so.        Mia dashes out -- and LEAPS into Sebastian's car and into his      arms. They KISS -- giddy, emotional, as though they'd been      separated for years. Sebastian drives off -- when --                 It's one-way!!      The car SCREECHES to a stop in front of a TRUCK going the      opposite direction. Sebastian goes into REVERSE as Mia cracks      up laughing. A BURST OF MUSIC as a title card pops on:                               Revision                          40.       The MUSIC carries us through the following series of GLIMPSES:62    -- Mia and Sebastian ambling past weathered 30's bungalows in 63    -- Mia guiding Sebastian down a street peppered with SILENT-      ERA HOMES, past old gas-lamps and palms...65    -- VAN BEEK. Sebastian gestures to the ""TAPAS & TUNES"" sign.      Excitedly tries to deface it. Mia, aghast, pulls him back...66    -- The HUNTINGTON GARDENS, where Mia and Sebastian gaze at      the tiny forest...A66   -- WATTS TOWERS, where the two lovers stroll and kiss... 64    -- The GRAND CENTRAL MARKET, where they grab food...68    -- ANGEL'S FLIGHT at night, where they stumble and slip into      a tipsy, love-soaked dance...       Interspersed throughout, WE SEE IMAGES OF LOS ANGELES:      1940's high-rises, green movie-movie lettering, ochre walls      shaded by palm fronds, red flowers and Spanish missions, old      lamps and Art Deco hotels. It's a gorgeous city, and the music      only makes it more gorgeous -- building and carrying us to...       A Lighthouse JAM SESSION. Sebastian's at the keys, having a      blast. The place is again mostly empty, but Mia is dancing her      heart out. She shoots looks at Sebastian. He laughs, plays out      for her. The two of them are in their own world -- one of pure,      unadulterated JOY...      The song ends. Sebastian rises, joins Mia. They sit down as      the band strikes up a new tune, and kiss.                 Sebastian?      Mia and Sebastian look up, startled. A YOUNG MAN, 35, is      standing next to them. Tall, fierce eyes. This is KEITH.                 Keith?                            Revision                       41.             Holy shit. Come here, man.Sebastian gets up. Gives him a hug. But Mia can sense anunease in Sebastian's eyes. It's a strained hug.             This is Mia. Mia, Keith.                   (explaining to Mia)            We used to play together. Hey, Mia.                         Hey...Sebastian sits back down. Wants to end the conversation.             So how've you been?             Great. You?             Keeping busy. Got a new combo.             Good for you.             ...Looking for keys.                    (after a beat)            I'm good.             You sure? It pays.Sebastian looks at Keith. A moment.             I'm good.Keith almost smiles. Expected this.             Let's just grab a drink then. Call me.            It's been too long.             You bet.             Nice meeting you, Mia.                              Revision                           42.                Nice meeting you.     Keith walks off. Mia and Sebastian look at each other. Then --      CLOSE ON MIA. She looks anxious. CLOSE ON Sebastian. He looks     head-over-heels in love.                It's beautiful.                ...You're just saying that.                No... I'm not.     We PULL BACK -- and see a script on Mia's lap. She's just     finished reading Sebastian her play.                I don't know... Is the whole thing too               nostalgic?                That's the point.                But do you think people will like it?                Fuck `em.                       (laughs)               You always say that.                I truly believe it.                Fine -- as long as you sit front-row               `cause I'll probably throw up on the               middle of the stage otherwise.                I'll be front-row.     Mia looks at him. Smiles. It genuinely means the world to     her. Then, a glow in her eyes, wants to reciprocate --                           Revision                       43.           I made something for you.She hops off the bed, fishes through a bag. Pulls out adrawing.           What's that?           It could be the name design. On the door.           Why does it say ""Seb's""?           That's what you should name it.           Never.           Sebastian, no one's going to a club called          ""Chicken on a Stick"".           You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name          ""Bird"" because he loved chicken. So my club's          gonna be old-school jazz and beer and          chicken. ""Chicken on a Stick"".           No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz.                 (he rolls his eyes)          And it's time to start looking for other          places.           It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them          samba all over its history.           Make your own history.Sebastian looks at her. Appreciates that line. A beat. Then --           Your play's incredible.Mia smiles. He approaches her, sits by her side.           The whole world from your bedroom? Who's          doing that?                         Revision                    44.           I'm doing that.They laugh.           So who was that guy at the Lighthouse?           ...Which guy?           The one who offered you a gig.           You mean Keith? He's the worst.           Why was it weird between you two?           It's always weird with him.           He did offer you a job.           Right...           Are you going to call him?           No.A beat.           Ok...A moment passes. They lie down, side by side.           Here's what we know. It's definitely          Chicken on a Stick --                 (Mia rolls her eyes)          -- and your play is going to be a          triumph.She looks at him. He looks at her. A shared smile.And on that --                               Revision                       45.      The next morning. Sebastian is in bed. Hears snatches of Mia's     voice -- she's on her phone in the other room:                ...No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... No,               I'm acting in it as well... No, I'm not               getting paid, I'm paying to do it...                      (then,)               He's great... He's going to open his own               jazz club. It's going to be incredible...                      (beat; then, softer --)               Well he has to get the money together               first, and... He's figuring it out...               Yeah, it's just been a little tricky               lately...     Sebastian listens. Takes it in.                Look -- he's going to find a way to open               it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's               Dad?     On Sebastian. He thinks...      Sebastian enters. Keith's combo is assembled.     It's a sign-up practice room in the West Valley. There's a     drummer, electric bassist, and trumpeter: COLE, MALCOLM and     TOM. They're more polished in their looks than Sebastian.     Well-groomed beards, tighter jeans.                Sebastian.     Sebastian approaches.                Didn't know if I'd see you today.                       (a bit awkward)               Well... Here I am.     A moment. Then --                Where's the piano?     Keith gestures -- to an electronic keyboard. Sebastian winces.                                  Revision                     46.                 Here's the deal. We've got distribution                with Universal, got our own imprint.                We're about to go on the road. We can cut                you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus                an equal share of any merchandise or                ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good?      We see Sebastian's face. Taken aback.                 Sebastian?                 Yeah, that...that...                       (beat)                ...sounds good.      A moment. Keith smiles.                 Let's play, see how it feels.      He pulls out a guitar. Cole starts on drums. Keith joins in.      Malcolm and Tom follow suit. Sebastian listens. It sounds like      modern jazz -- electronic in feel, but still jazz...      Sebastian approaches the keyboard. Joins -- slowly, one step      at a time. Then begins playing out a bit more, his fingers      starting to race. Malcolm gives Keith a look: ""Damn"". Keith      gives Malcolm a look back: ""I told you so."" Bit by bit,      Sebastian eases into the groove. This isn't so bad...      Then -- Keith moves to a LAPTOP. Introduces a DRUM-MACHINE       Sebastian, into the music, is caught off-guard. Uneasy now.      This isn't him...      Keith plays a riff on his guitar. Tom echoes it on bass, then      Malcolm on trumpet. Now it's Sebastian's turn. He hesitates.      And then -- finally -- he plays the riff...      It doesn't feel so bad. The guys build on the riff. Sebastian      keeps up with them, trying to let go of his presuppositions.      After all -- these guys can play...      The music builds, the whole thing swelling and finally A73   LATER: Sebastian and Keith sit across from each other as      the other players pack up. Sebastian looks pensive. Noticing --                              Revision                          47.                I know. It's different.     Sebastian stays silent. Then, leaning in --                But you say you want to save jazz. How               are you going to save jazz if no one's               listening? Jazz wouldn't exist if people               hadn't gotten tired of what they were               listening to before.                      (then,)               I mean, do you really think a bunch of               ninety-year-olds in a basement is the               future of the form? Traditionalists whined               when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs.               If traditionalists had their way, we'd               still be playing Dixieland.     Sebastian considers this. As much as he might make a play of     resisting -- we can tell the words are getting to him...                You're holding onto the past. But jazz is               about the future.     A moment. Then --                I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't               as good as you. But you're a pain in the               ass, man.     Sebastian nods. Knows he can't argue with that.     Another beat.                If it's not your thing, just let me know.               I don't want you uncomfortable and trying               to change this into something it's not.               But if you want it -- the job's yours.     Sebastian looks at Keith. A moment. He's really weighing     this. And on that -- his look of uncertainty -- we're --                                       Revision                      48.77pt   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DUSK       The door opens. Mia enters. Takes a deep breath. Hears piano.       Steps forward and sees Sebastian at his piano -- playing a       melody we've heard before. [CITY OF STARS AS DUET]       She smiles. Sebastian begins to SING. Mia sits down beside       him and begins to SING as well. They share a duet -- simple,       unaffected, hopeful -- the music just perhaps suggesting       their uncertainty about what they might be about to do...       As the vocals give way to instrumentation, we're --           Sebastian and Keith hunched over paperwork. Sebastian signs...        Mia handing the Manager her apron. She's done with the job...        The band rehearsing in their new PRACTICE SPACE. We see       Sebastian play, see Keith sing this time...        Mia hunched over her script, obsessively fine-tuning it...          Sebastian gets dressed up in a new suit...        We follow Mia through a BLACK-BOX THEATER in North Hollywood.       The space is small, simple -- but perfect. We see her haggle       with the OWNER -- and then light up. They shake hands...        Sebastian and the band in a green room, waiting. Sebastian's       wearing the new suit. Looking sharper...                                Revision                          49.       Mia looking for PROPS. Another wild assortment -- a TOP HAT,      a CANE, a DIORAMA of London, rolled-up MAPS, an old GLOBE...        We MOVE IN on a laptop. On it a YOUTUBE video plays -- an      interview with Sebastian, Keith and the rest of the band...       Mia drives by the Rialto theater. It's now CLOSED...       Mia sits on the floor, penciling out drawings for her play.      Costume and poster sketches scattered by her feet. She's      tired. The clock on the wall reads: 10:54pm.       Mia gets into bed. Checks her phone. Turns off the light.       Sebastian enters the apartment. Checks his reflection in the      mirror -- a new addition. The clock reads: 4:57am.       Sebastian gets into bed, careful not to wake Mia.       Mia crosses through to the kitchen to get herself breakfast,      careful not to wake Sebastian. The clock: 7:02am.       Sebastian in bed, fast asleep. And WE RETURN TO...       ...Mia and Sebastian at the piano, before this latest journey      began, finishing their song. The last lyrics resonating as      they look into one another's eyes:       City of stars...              You've never shined so                                    brightly.                              Revision                           50.     On that -- this image of love, Sebastian playing out the     final chords on his piano -- WE GO DARK.     All sound fades out. And then, we hear --     -- a CROWD CHEERING. [START A FIRE]     We see -- a white spotlight. It reveals Sebastian. We're --      Sebastian is on-stage. He's the only musician we can see. The     floor beyond the stage is FILLED with people.     Among them, we spot Mia -- beaming with pride. Sebastian sees     her, smiles to her as he plays a piano intro. Mia grins right     back, heart swelling...     A SECOND SPOTLIGHT turns on, illuminating Keith. He SINGS. He     has a beautiful voice. Mia bobs her head. It's just Keith and     Sebastian right now, all acoustic, a simple, catchy tune...     And then -- suddenly -- a DRUM MACHINE SURGES IN -- and --     BOOM! The entire CLUB is lit up as the MUSIC EXPLODES. A full-     fledged dance beat and a thick radio-ready electronic track.     Mia is taken aback. But she keeps bobbing her head -- as the     crowd around her GOES CRAZY...     Keith owns the stage, as Sebastian plays out more -- now     switched to an electronic keyboard, complete with synth     sounds. We recognize fragments of melody from when Keith and     Sebastian first rehearsed -- but the tune has been     transformed beyond recognition. Not a hint of jazz...     Keith breaks into the CHORUS -- and a TRIO OF BACKUP SINGERS     are revealed stage-left. The band surges into the song's     bridge -- and BACKUP DANCERS appear stage-right, scantily-     clad.     And then -- the lights go NUTS. It's a full-out LIGHT SHOW     now, shafts of red, blue, green and orange cutting through     the dark. The crowd starts CHEERING, pumping their fists...     Mia looks at Sebastian. He's not fighting any of this. He     sees her. She smiles. But something is changing in her     expression...     She looks at the lights, the singers, the dancers, Sebastian     and his bandmates in matching magazine-cover-ready outfits.     She looks at the crowd around her -- their hollers growing     more and more frenzied as Sebastian launches into a prolonged                                Revision                          51.     Mia looks back at him, takes it all in: Is this really him...?     As the mass of people swells and moves, Mia finds herself     PUSHED TO THE SIDE, bit by bit, away from the center...     She tries to hold her ground, but is edged FURTHER AND     FURTHER AWAY. Sebastian, deep in his solo, doesn't notice.     Mia tugs against the tide of the crowd, but to no avail.     She's pushed to the back of the club, away from the lights     and into shadow...     The final chorus begins -- floor-shaking, fist-pounding. We     linger on Mia's face -- watching as the band feverishly tear     into their climactic bars, the dancers on-stage and the crowd     below busting out one last burst of CRAZED CHOREOGRAPHY --     ending the song just as we SMASH CUT TO A TITLE CARD OVER       Silence.     We take a moment to collect ourselves before --       CLOSE on Mia. She looks tired. A bit weathered. She's nursing a     green tea across from Laura. They've finished eating.                 Look at him -- watch --     Mia glances out the window. A MAN in his early 40's has just     parked, is walking around his car, inspecting it.                 Now he's going to check the other window.                Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check                again. Yep, still closed.     Mia smiles. The MAN enters the restaurant -- greets Mia -- and     kisses Laura. This is HARRY. Her new boyfriend.                 Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two                want anything?                 Thanks Harry, I'm good.                           Revision                       52.           Same here but I think someone's trying to          break into your car.Harry rolls his eyes, heads to the front. Laura looks at Mia.           Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now?           I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure...A moment passes.           You should come over tonight. Harry's          cooking, but don't let that stop you.                 (Mia manages a smile; a beat)          What's the matter?           Nothing...           You miss him.           I guess. I'm adapting.                  (nods; then,)          I got used to being alone. Growing up it          was just me and Seb. We only had each other.           He told me.           I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met          Harry and -- we just fit...                 (Mia smiles)          You've changed Seb. You know that?Laura means it positively -- but Mia seems concerned...           Do you think he's happy?           Is he happy?           I mean with the band, the travel, all of it.                              Revision                        53.     Laura shrugs.                Our dad never got to do what he wanted.               We were always treading water, he took a               job running a washer-dryer store. But               every night at home he'd play his               clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record.                      (a beat)               So I look at Sebastian... Playing music,               getting paid for it. I'm happy for him.     She notices Harry through the window, returning. Her thoughts     drift.                Dreams change.     A beat. She looks back at Mia. Sees her worry.                Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon.     Harry rejoins the table. Hands Laura a sponge cake.                I told you not to get me anything!                Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess.                No -- I changed my mind.     They laugh. Kiss. Tender. Loving. Mia watches...      Mia eats, her laptop next to her meal. She takes a bite, types.     We see her screen -- an e-mail draft, glimpses of words: ""one-     woman show"", ""one night only"", ""7pm"", ""I would be thrilled...""     She thinks. Picks up her phone. Dials Sebastian. Waits. No     answer.                Hey it's me... Not sure where you are --               maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I               haven't heard from you in a while... I               miss you...                      (a beat)               Ok... Bye...     She hangs up. Resumes typing.                                   Revision                    54.      Mia walks through the courtyard. Reaches the door. Then hears     something... Music -- LOUD, FAST JAZZ...     She enters -- has to jostle the door handle to do so --     -- and then freezes in place. Sebastian is sashaying around a     fully-decked table, lighting candles as he moves. He looks     up, sees her -- and grins.                   Surprise.     She lights up. He lifts up silver serving trays, revealing     what he's cooked. Roast chicken. Pasta.                   And...                         (he hurries to the kitchen --                          and holds up a big apple pie)                  There's twenty-five pounds of apples in                  it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem                  but it tastes good.     Mia laughs. Can't believe it. Sebastian looks at her --     sincere now.                   I have to head back in the morning but I                  needed to see you.     Mia's eyes seem almost on the brink of tears. Beyond moved,     she runs into Sebastian's arms. A LONG, HEARTFELT KISS...      CLOSE ON: The record player. An old jazz track. We see Mia and     Sebastian seated at the table -- eating, drinking, laughing.                   Feels so good to be home.                   Stay.     He smiles.                   How's the play going?                   I'm nervous.                          Revision                 55.           Why?           Because...                 (a beat)          What if people show up?           Fuck `em!Laughter. Then --           You're nervous about what they think?           I'm nervous to be up on a stage and          perform in front of people. I'm          terrified.           They should be so lucky to see it.                 (then,)          It's going to be incredible. I can't          wait.           I can.A smile. Beat.           What time do you leave in the morning?            Ugh.           Yep. Boise.           Boise?                  (nods)          You should come.           To Boise?                         Revision                     56.           Yeah, you could knock that off your          bucket list.Mia laughs.           Wish I could.A beat.           Why can't you?           Come to Boise?           Yeah.           Because I have to rehearse.           Can't you rehearse anywhere?She looks at him.           You mean anywhere you are?           ...I -- I guess...           Well, all my stuff is here and my show's          in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it          doesn't seem practical...           Right... I just -- we're going to have to          do things so we can see each other. We          never see each other.           I know, but when are you done?           ...What do you mean?           When are you done with the tour?                           Revision                   57.           But -- as soon as we're done with the          tour we go back and record, and then we          go back on tour.Mia looks at him. Doesn't seem to understand.           We tour so we can make the record, and          then we go back on tour to sell the          record.Beat. Mia takes this in.           So it's...the long haul?           ...What does that mean?           I mean the long haul -- like, you're          going to be in this band for a long time.           What did you think I was going to do?           I don't know, I didn't think the band          would --           You didn't think we'd be successful.           No, that's not what I meant. What I meant          was -- this band -- you're going to be on          the road for -- what, years now?           Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road          for years with just this record.Beat.           Do you like the music you're playing?           I don't know how that matters.           It matters if you're going to give up          your dream to be on the road for years.               Revision                    58. Do you like the music I'm playing? Yes. I do.       (beat)I just didn't think you did. Yeah, well, I -- And now I hear you're going to be on theroad for years, and I'm -- What are you doing? Why are you doingthis? What do you mean why am I doing this? This is what you wanted from me. To be in this band? To have a steady job. Yes, I wanted you to have a job so youcould take care of yourself and startyour club. So I'm doing that. So why aren't wecelebrating? Why aren't you starting your club? You said yourself no one wants to go tothat club! No one wants to go to a clubcalled Chicken on a Stick -- Change the name! -- and no one likes jazz. Not even you.                         Revision                         59.           I do like jazz now, because of you.                  (not listening to her)          What am I supposed to do? Go back to          playing ""Jingle Bells"" so I can save          money for some Shangri-La club no one          wants to go to?           People will want to go to it! People love          what other people are passionate about.           Not in my experience.A beat. Mia realizes she's getting nowhere. A moment ofquiet. Then --           Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know?          This is what I'm doing. If you had a          problem, I wish you would've said          something earlier, before I signed on the          dotted line.                  (trying again)          You had a dream that you were sticking          to, that --           This is the dream!           This is not your dream.           Guys like me go their whole lives and          never do anything that's liked. I'm          finally doing something that people          enjoy. What is wrong with that?           Why do you care so much about being liked                   (finally bursting--)          You're an actress, who are you to talk??Silence. We suddenly realize --                                 Revision                        60.     -- the LP has finished. You can hear the needle scratch     against it now -- back and forth, back and forth. Sebastian     looks at Mia.     A moment. Finally --                Maybe you liked me more when I was a               failure because it made you feel better               about yourself.     Mia looks back at him. Can't believe he said that. Tears     starting to well in her eyes. She tries to suppress them.                Are you kidding?                No.     They stare at each other.     Then -- all of a sudden -- the FIRE ALARM blares.     Sebastian turns and sees smoke billowing from the KITCHEN. A     dish in the oven has started to burn.     Sebastian rises, springs toward the kitchen -- then sees Mia     grabbing her things.                Wait --     But she's out the door. It slams shut, as Sebastian pulls the     burnt apple pie from the oven.     And on that -- WE SMASH CUT TO --       A poster, placed on the front of the theater we saw before.     A title. A name below it: ""MIA DOLAN."" And a word: ""TONIGHT.""     We spot Mia, carrying a box of props. She enters the theater.     And we're --      The empty theater. Dark. Silent. Then -- a light turns on.     Mia steps in. We stay WIDE. She seems small from this     vantage point, surrounded by her props and backdrops. She     takes a moment. Looks at all the empty seats.                                   Revision                       61.      Takes a deep breath. Nervous. And then, nodding to herself --      you can do this -- she starts setting up...       A BLAST of music. The Messengers have just finished a      rehearsal. Sebastian packs his stuff, heads toward the exit,      nodding to the others --       See you tomorrow.                 See ya.      -- when --                    You good for tonight, right?      Sebastian stops. Looks at Keith.                    ...Tonight?                    Seven. The photo shoot.                          (reading Sebastian's face, adding --)                   Mojo.      A beat. Sebastian is confused.                    I thought that was next Thursday.                    No. It's tonight.      We linger on Sebastian for a moment...                    Is that ok?       Sebastian stands out front. Checks his watch. Thinks...        People are shuffling into the theater. We DRIFT BACKSTAGE.      Mia, now in a male suit and tie, watches behind a curtain.      Checks her phone. 7:04. Breathes in. Nervous, and alone...      She turns. Nods to the OWNER, off to the side. He heads to a      switch, and the lights GO DOWN.                                  Revision                        62.      You can hear the murmurs beyond the curtain. The audience,      expecting. Mia tries to get her nerves under control. She can      do this... Sets her phone aside -- one last breath --      -- and walks out.         LOUD MUSIC. It's the band's song, blaring from a speaker.      They're pantomiming -- the musicians styled and ready for      their close-ups. A PHOTOGRAPHER grabs shots.                 Put a light on the drums... I need more                fill in this corner...      We ZERO IN on Sebastian. His hair sticks out at various      angles. An artfully-undone tie hangs from his neck. He      fake-plays, as Keith pretends to lay in sampled beats...      Keith, Tom, Malcolm, Cole -- they all grin, as excited as      kids. Sebastian looks at them -- then down at his      elaborate outfit, then back up at the Photographer      running around, then at his watch...                 Bass, head up. Piano, look down at the                keys.      Sebastian does as told, but his thoughts are elsewhere. The      Photographer moves in close, SNAPPING shots of just him --                 Cut the music. Turn the keyboard live.                Piano look up, play.      The track stops. Sebastian stops as well. The CLICKS of the      Photographer's camera loud now.                 No -- piano -- actually play something.      Sebastian is still. Then he starts to play a single melody      on the keys. We recognize it. The first notes of his and      Mia's song...                               Revision                        63.                 Good, now bite your lip like you're                concentrating on a solo.      Beat. Sebastian stops. Silence. He stares ahead.                 That was good. Don't stop.      We PUSH IN on Sebastian...       We're CLOSE on Mia. In ordinary clothes now.      Behind her is a wallpapered wall, and a small window. By      her side are the globe we saw in her room, and other little      trinkets: a pearl necklace, an old suitcase, a roll of      maps. Outside the window, projection of a starlit Parisian      night sky. Completely silent, Mia moves to a lamp, turns it      off.      We go BLACK.      Then -- the house lights go on. White, fluorescent. Thin      applause can be heard. Mia manages a smile, as we finally see --      -- that the theater is less than a quarter full.      Mia takes a bow. Peers out. One seat, in the front row, has a      ""RESERVED"" sign on it. The seat is empty.        Mia slips inside, holding in her hurt. Starts collecting a      few outfits -- then overhears two AUDIENCE MEMBERS outside --                 I swear to God, if I have to hear one                more hipster waxing nostalgic I'm gonna                slit my wrists.                 Seriously.                 She's not even good. That window                thing...?                 Christ... Don't quit your day job...                                   Revision                       64.      Laughter.      Mia freezes. The nail in the coffin. The voices fade. She      slides into a chair.       Sebastian SPEEDING. Screeching to a stop. He's at Mia's THEATER.      He dashes out and runs to the door.      But it's locked. No one's in sight. Fuck.      He spins around, frantic -- when Mia appears from an adjacent      doorway, alone and carrying her box of props to her car.                   Mia!      She turns. Sees him. He runs to her. WRAPS his arms around --                   I'm sorry --      -- and KISSES her. The kind of kiss that might once have      swept her off her feet. He starts to move with her...      ...starts to DANCE -- but --                   Stop --      She pulls away. Steps back. Sebastian looks at her. Unmoored.                   I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm                  sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise                  I'll make it up to you --                   It's over.      She doesn't say the words with any anger. Just acceptance.                          (a beat; then --)                  ...What do you mean?                   I'm done embarrassing myself.                   You didn't embarrass yourself...                                   Revision                     65.                  No one showed up. I can't even pay back                 the theater.       She says this as though just realizing it. Sebastian looks       at her. A moment passes. He doesn't know what to say now.                  I'm gonna go home for a while.                  ...This is home.                  Not anymore.       Sebastian is silent now. A tear in his eye. He clenches his       jaw. Mia looks at him one more time, steps into her car, and       drives off.       Sebastian lingers. Doesn't move. Silence. Then, music. Soft,       melancholy, just piano, as...            Mia drives, boxes stacked in the back.A113   She gets on the 405... Heading out of the city...        Mia steps inside a modest house. Her MOM is by the door. Hugs       her. Her DAD stands by the hallway.        Mia enters her old bedroom. Slides in a suitcase. Moves a couple       of boxes from the hall. Looks around. Old photos. Old soccer       trophies. She sits down on the bed. Takes a breath. And,       finally, we're...        Laura and Harry's ENGAGEMENT PARTY. We're outside, in a sun-       dappled grove. A small gathering.                                  Revision                       66.      Sebastian plays a baby grand piano -- the source, we realize,      of the music we've been hearing...      As he watches   Laura dance with her new fianc� -- this woman he      has known for   so many years as a romantic cynic, now once      again full of   all the youthful innocence of first love -- his      thoughts seem   to drift. The music comes to a close and...117   LATER: Sebastian with Laura, by the orange trees...                 You remember the McKenzies?                 Oh God, I didn't see them.                 Yeah. They kept going, ""oh Sebastian's so                handsome"".      Sebastian smiles. Then --                 You look beautiful.                       (beat)                I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while.                 You were great                       (pause)                You're always great when you play.      Sebastian is silent. Then --                 Now -- listen to me. I want you to save                for a down payment. You understand? You                need a home.                 Yes ma'am.                 I'm not gonna be hovering anymore.                 ...You still think New York?                 I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know,                it's exciting...      Sebastian smiles again. Some calls from the distance --                                  Revision                     67.                 Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws...      She lights up. Likes the sound of that.                 Is my...my hair...?      Sebastian, without a word, pulls a strand back. Laura smiles,      kisses him on the cheek. A quiet, tender moment. Then she      hurries off. Sebastian stands there. Watches...        RINGING. Sebastian is awoken. Groaning, he rolls over. Lets      the phone ring. It keeps going. Endless... Finally, fed up, he      reaches for it. Answers --                 What...?                 Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan.      Sebastian is taken aback. He goes to hang up, saying just --                 Wrong number.                 -- She's not answering her cell and I was                told I might find her here.      Sebastian pauses. Hurt by the mere mention of Mia's name --                 Yeah, well...not anymore.                 Ok. If you do talk to her --                 I won't.                 -- please tell her Jane at Amy Brandt                Casting is trying to reach her.      A beat. Sebastian sits up. Suddenly wide-eyed.                 ""Casting""...?                                  Revision                      68.       Dinner has just finished. Mia's Mom gives her a kiss --       Night, sweetie.                 Night, Mom.      -- and heads off, as Mia and her Dad stay behind. Getting up      to scrape the dish --                  You want some more rice?                  I'm ok.                  You look hungry.                  I'm good...      A moment. Mia's Dad puts a few more dishes away, then sits      back down across from her.                  It's fun having you back. Your mom                 ditches me at ten.      Mia laughs. A moment.                  You took down the swing.                  She made me.      A smile.                  I've still got all your old tapes.                  Oh God. Throw those away.                  Never.      Just then -- a loud, persistent HONK. Mia's Dad looks up,      eyebrow raised. Mia turns, hearing it as well. The HONKING      is nearby -- just outside...      Mia's thoughts suddenly sharpen. Ears perk up. She's heard the      honking before:                               Revision                         69.                  What the hell...?      Disbelief on Mia's face. It can't be. She heads to the nearest      window. There -- at the corner, smack-dab in front of her      house -- is SEBASTIAN'S CAR.      A NEIGHBOR angrily yells at him. Sebastian sees Mia. They lock      eyes. And on that --       Mia and Sebastian stand next to his car.                 Why did you come here?                 Because I have good news.                 Ok...                 Amy Brandt. The casting director.                 I know who she is.                 She was at your play. And she loved it.                And she loved it so much that she wants                you to come audition for a huge movie                she's got.      He's brimming over with excitement. But Mia just shakes      her head.                 I'm not going.                 ...Excuse me?                 I'm -- no... That will kill me.                 That's it?                 Yes.                           Revision                    70.           So you're happy here?           I'm happier.           Why won't you come?           I told you.           I don't buy it.                  (finally letting it out, fed up --)          Because it's another audition!                 (a beat; then --)          I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do          you want to know what happens? Either          they interrupt me because someone ordered          a sandwich, or they cut me off after two          seconds, or I'm crying and they start          laughing, or I'm one of a hundred          lookalikes in the waiting room who never          has a chance, because --                 (beat)          -- because --           Because what?           Because I'm probably not good enough.           Yes you are.           No. Maybe I'm not.A beat.           Maybe I'm one of those people who's          always wanted to do it but never had a          chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's          like you said. Maybe I need to grow up.She hesitates. Continues --                               Revision                         71.                 I can go back to school. I can find                something else that I'm supposed to do. I                left school to give it a shot, and it                didn't work out, and it took six years,                and I don't want to do it anymore.      Beat. But Sebastian isn't giving up.                 Why?                 Why what?                 Why don't you want to do it anymore?      Mia thinks about this one for a moment.                 ...Because it hurts a little bit too                much.      Sebastian shakes his head. Nope. Won't accept this.                 I told them you'd be there at five-thirty                tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I                drive back at eight. Either you'll be                outside or you won't.      With that, he gets back into his car. Mia is silent. Then --                 How did you find me?      Sebastian turns. Points. Matter-of-fact --                 The house across from the library.      He drives off. Mia looks up. There, sure enough, is the      LIBRARY, crouched on the corner. The library that once      helped set her on her path to acting.      She looks at it. Thinks...       Wide on the street. All is quiet. Night becomes morning...                                 Revision                         72.       Sebastian's car pulls over. He sits there. Sips a coffee, a      second coffee in the holder. The time: 8:02.      A moment passes. He taps the wheel. Looks at the house. The      front door remains closed. No Mia. He leans back. Seems      worried. Closes his eyes, breathes out. We MOVE CLOSE on him.      He breathes in and out again...      He opens his eyes. 8:10. The door's still closed. Resigned,      he starts his car up, BEGINS TO PULL AWAY, when --      -- BAM! A KNOCK on the opposite window. He jumps.      It's Mia. She's just arrived at the car from the other side,      two just-bought cups of coffee and a bag of pastries in her      hands. A beat. Sebastian smiles. Then OPENS the door for her.        A cloudy late afternoon. Mia and Sebastian slowly walk      through the lot together. They pass the New York street, the      murals and posters of classic Hollywood, the old Art Deco      ornaments and the big soundstages and backdrops. Neither says      a word...       Mia and Sebastian are seated. Waiting. The DOOR opens. An      ACTRESS exits. A second later --                   Mia?      Mia gathers her nerves. Gets up. And steps in.       In the room is AMY BRANDT -- mid-forties. Seated behind her      is the director, FRANK.       Hi, Mia.                        Hi.                   I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you.      Mia nods. Smiles. A moment.                   The movie shoots in Paris. There's no script.                                   Revision                        73.                  We want to build the character with you.                 It's a process. Three-month rehearsal,                 four-month shoot.                  ...Ok.                  So why don't you just tell us a story?                  ...About...?                  About anything.       Mia nods again. A moment.                  Whenever you're ready.       Mia thinks. She takes a breath -- then goes silent again. It       seems she might be unsure what to do, might even be about to       choke the audition. We fear she may botch this completely...A126   WE CUT TO THE LOBBY -- to Sebastian, hearing Mia's silence. On       edge... Worried...B126   WE RETURN to the AUDITION ROOM... Brandt and Frank waiting...                  My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She                 used to tell me these stories, when I was                 growing up, about living abroad...                        (beat)                 I remember -- she told me she jumped into                 the Seine once...       She pauses, and then continues -- in SONG. [TRACK: AUDITION]       Yes, this audition is different than the rest, and the switch       to song signals just that. Mia's nerves fade away -- all the       accents and fakery of earlier auditions a distant memory. This       is Mia undisguised -- pure and stark and beautiful...       She uses the story of her aunt jumping into the river to       paint a portrait of all the dreamers in the world -- all the       people who are told they're nuts for pursuing their passion --       all the so-called ""fools"" who take the plunge. She sings       about them and for them. This is why Mia does what she does --       why she simply has no choice...       The song ends, and we linger on her for a moment. Then...                                  Revision                     74.        Mia and Sebastian sit on a bench, the Observatory perched      behind them. The clouds have parted, and it's now a gorgeous      Los Angeles afternoon, minutes before dusk.      Sebastian looks at Mia. A moment passes.                 When do you find out?                 They said the next couple of days... But                I'm not expecting to find anything out.                 You're going to get it.                 No, I'm not.                 You are. I know these things.      A beat.                 Where are we?      Sebastian looks at her.                 Griffith Park.                 I mean -- where are we?                 I know...                       (beat)                I don't know.                 What do we do?                 I don't think we can do anything. Because                when you get this --                 If I get this --                         Revision                           75.           When you get this -- you've got to give          it everything you've got.Beat.           It's your dream.           What are you going to do?           I've got to follow my own plan. Stay          here. Get my own thing going. You know...A moment. Mia nods. Sebastian looks at her again.           You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz          there. And you love jazz now.Mia smiles.           Right?           Right.Another moment. And then, finally --           I guess we're just going to have to wait          and see.Mia's eyes well up, just slightly, as she hears this. Shenods.           You know I'm always going to love you.           I'm always going to love you too.Beat. Sebastian looks up at the Observatory.           Look at this view.                  (playfully)          I've seen better.                                 Revision                         76.                 Agreed.      They laugh.      Then, almost to herself --                 I've never been here during the day.      Sebastian smiles. A moment.      We CUT TO WIDE. Sebastian and Mia sit side by side. We linger      here, our two characters framed by the white-and-green      Observatory, the rest of L.A. stretching out beyond.      And then, ever so slowly...      ...we FADE TO:       A palm tree, a cloudless sky. We PULL BACK -- to reveal it's      all painted...       We're on a studio lot, looking at one of the old painted      backdrops, of a palm tree and sky. A new title card:                          Five years later...      We TILT down to the studio's entryway. A CAR enters.      A WOMAN steps out. We don't see her face. We FOLLOW her from      behind. She walks elegantly, poised. The wind picks up a      strand of her hair. She makes her way down side-streets we've      seen before, past Parisian-style fa�ades. Then enters a      COFFEE SHOP we recognize...       The eyes inside all look the WOMAN's way. She reaches the      counter -- and we finally SEE HER FACE:                 Hi... Iced coffee, please.      MIA looks different. Different haircut, different way of      handling herself.      The BARISTA hurries to get Mia's order. We recognize this as      the shop where Mia used to work. A man who appears to be the      NEW MANAGER gives Mia the coffee --                                 Revision                      77.                 On us.                 No, no, that's fine.      Mia hands over a few dollar bills. Then drops another bill into      the tip jar. The Barista smiles.       Mia exits the coffee shop...and is met by a CREW MEMBER on a      GOLF CART. She gets on the cart -- and is driven away...       CLOSE ON hands on piano keys, fluttering across the ivories.      We PULL BACK: it's SEBASTIAN. We're in...       ...a small jazz club. Simple, tasteful, cool. Stone arches in      1940's style. The seats close to the band, the piano in the      center. The club has the same old-school character as the      Lighthouse -- but it's not run-down. It's polished, inviting.      The place is empty save for Sebastian and an EMPLOYEE. It's      before-hours. Sebastian finishes playing. Feels out the      lowest keys once more, then the highest. Then turns and --                 Alright, I'm done.                       (gets up)                Harris did a nice job with it.                 Took him long enough.      Sebastian smiles.                 No one touches the instruments. Carson's                coming an hour early to test levels.                 I got a check for you to sign.                 How'd we do last month?                 Not too bad.                                Revision                          78.                        (as he signs the check)                Not too bad is great.                       (taps the Employee on the                        shoulder)                See you tonight.                 See you tonight.       Mia pulls into the driveway.       She steps inside. Flowers and cards. We glimpse cursive      ""CONGRATULATIONS"" written on a few of them. A stack of scripts      on a nearby table. Her name visible. She drops her things,      spots someone, goes in to kiss him. A long, tender, loving      embrace, as we pull back...      ...and see that it's not Sebastian.      It's a MAN we haven't seen before: DAVID, mid-thirties. He      and Mia kiss again. And, running over and grabbing Mia's leg,      is a TWO-YEAR-OLD GIRL...       Sebastian steps in. The place is more habitable than his old      digs. Fully furnished, warm and welcoming. He heads to the      kitchen, pulls out some pork cutlets he's been thawing. We see,      sitting on the counter, a Christmas card with a photo attached:      Laura, Harry, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY, all gathered on a couch      and smiling at the camera.       Sebastian eats his meal, in a new shirt and pants. Checks      his watch.       Sebastian pulls up outside the club. New car, same style.      Gets out and passes by a movie poster as he walks. We      can't see the title, but we can catch a glimpse of a face      on it.      It's MIA...       We're back in the club.                                  Revision                       79.      It's bustling now -- the BARTENDERS setting up, DOORMEN      coming in, MUSICIANS sound-checking. Sebastian enters, the      musicians greet him --                 King Seb!                 Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?                 Like the desert misses the rain.      And then -- we see a SAXOPHONIST we recognize. One of the old      Lighthouse players.                 Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight.                 Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh?                 That's not Edgar.      Laughs, pats on the back.       Mia, in a new outfit, crosses the living area and grabs her      purse and jacket. David is by the door, jacket on as well.      Mia bends back around a sofa, where the GIRL we saw before is      seated next to a nineteen-year-old baby-sitter, CHELSEA.                 Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea.      The Girl nods. Mia kisses her forehead. Heads to the door.                 Bye, Mrs. Dolan.        David drives, Mia seated beside him. They're on the 101.      Gridlock traffic up ahead.                 What if we miss this? What do we tell                Natalie?                                 Revision                      80.                 We can just see it back in New York...      David nods. Looks at the time on the car. 8:06.       Mia and David are seated. Still not moving. Mia looks at the      clock again: 8:27.                 Do you want to just skip it...? Turn off                here and get dinner?      David looks at her. Smiles.                 Alright...       Mia and David walk down a street. A few open restaurants and      bars, a few other closed storefronts. A lot of old, weathered      buildings: 1930's stucco, Art Deco signs.      Then -- David's ears perk up. He hears something. MUSIC...      He looks around. Doesn't see the source. Heads to the end of      the block, then sees, just up ahead, a few people entering a      building. Seems to be where the music's coming from...      Mia heads over, curious. The music grows louder -- sounds like      a JAZZ COMBO. Mia peeks toward the door...      ...and then FREEZES.      The sign on the door reads: ""SEB'S"". It's written the way she      drew it for Sebastian, years ago...      Coming up to her side, oblivious --                 This looks fun.      David edges past Mia. Glimpses the bar inside. Turns to her,      inviting --                 Come on...      Mia doesn't know what to say. She follows David...                               Revision                          81.       Inside, a JAZZ COMBO is tearing through a fast bop chart. The      seats around the band are almost all occupied. Young fans,      older couples, passersby trickling in from outside. It's an      excited crowd, far more varied than what we saw at the      Lighthouse -- a real range of ages and styles.      Mia's eyes drift as David heads to the bar. She recognizes the      images on the walls -- all Sebastian's. Recognizes a stool by      the bar -- also Sebastian's, formerly Hoagy Carmichael's...                 Mia?      She turns to David. Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows      him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the      bandstand...      The combo finishes. Hearty applause. A young PIANIST rises      from the keys, waves ""thanks"".      And -- just then -- Sebastian appears. Mia looks at him,      frozen.                        (taking the microphone)                Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen.                       (more applause)                I don't know, I told him to play ""Jingle                Bells"".      The crowd laughs. Sebastian smiles, looks at them --      -- and sees Mia.      Shock. The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first      time they've seen each other in years.      A prolonged silence. Sebastian is speechless.      Then -- forcing himself to keep on a face --                 Welcome to Seb's.      More applause. Sebastian sits at the piano. Looks at the keys.      He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at      Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow      musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys --      -- and finally starts playing.                                 Revision                         82.      A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A      melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize...      It's Mia and Sebastian's song.      Mia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys.      This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. The      most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded.      We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It      recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT      that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian      plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at      first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in      perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon...144   ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT... Back when      Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time...      Within this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece.      We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. All is      as before, as we remember it... And sure enough, Mia      approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and --                 I just wanted to say -- I saw your                playing, and I --      -- but instead of brushing past her --      -- Sebastian decks her with a kiss for the ages.      A BURST OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. The DINERS in the restaurant spin      around to face Mia and Sebastian -- and SNAP their fingers in      time. Even the Boss starts to DANCE. Mia and Sebastian grin --      and then strut out together, hand in hand... [EPILOGUE]       Mia and Sebastian push open a new door -- to their new place.      It's a shabby one-bedroom -- but it's theirs...       Next, Keith approaches Sebastian at the Lighthouse -- but      Sebastian immediately shakes his head ""no"".       Sebastian watches Mia perform -- it's the night of her play.      He stands up to applaud -- and behind him, the entire      theater, utterly packed, rises as well. A huge standing      ovation. Mia's ROOMMATES are there, giddy with joy, as are      LAURA and HARRY...                                  Revision                          83.          Mia and Sebastian walk together outside -- but now that we're         outside we realize this isn't the real L.A. at all..         This, in fact, is an L.A. that doesn't exist. A painted-         backdrop L.A., just like the one we saw Mia pass by when         parking on the lot...         The old orange groves and the gabled rooftops and the moss-         covered bungalows and the ivy-decked lamps, the jacaranda         trees and the giant hills and Griffith and the Santa Monica         Pier -- all painted, all props, all figments of a studio-         backdrop imagination. We've entered a fully fantastical         realm, the realm of the old Hollywood ballets of the 40's and         50's...A148     Everyone DANCES -- the pedestrians and the street performers         and the cops and the guards... AMY BRANDT races up to Mia --         seems to beckon her to audition... We see the audition         silhouetted against a wall... We don't hear Mia sing, but the         music takes on the melody of her song, carrying us to...B148     PARIS... Sebastian travels there with Mia... We chart the         journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia use         for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old-         Hollywood-movie way...         Finally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP of         Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. The Sacr�-Coeur         and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in bright         colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretching         before us... And then a sign -- ""CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE""...C148     We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-like jazz club.         Sebastian plays, on cloud nine...C148pt   We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights and cranes,         decked in movie-movie glow.         We're BACK to the Caveau. The lights go out -- except for the         TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. We MOVE in         close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell --D148     -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. Mia and         Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians frozen         around them... Finally, they stop and look at one another...         And -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter like         all the stars of the galaxy...         ...they DANCE.                                  Revision                        84.      This is the last time we'll ever see them dance, and they      seem to recognize that, so graceful and poised are their      movements... Remember -- this is a romance more perfect than      a real romance could ever be...      We DISSOLVE again -- to a projector beam...      16mm footage plays on a screen, full of scratches and pockets      of light... Mia and Sebastian sit down to watch together --      and we see the following moments in brief, vivid GLIMPSES, as      we move in closer on the imagery:149   The first home... (16mm)150   Mia's pregnancy... (16mm)151   The newborn child... (16mm)152   The child's first birthday... (16mm)153   The child's first day of pre-school, all dressed up... (16mm)      Everything here glows with the warmth of old home movies...      These are memories, fluttering by, grabbed at random -- and      yet all concocted, dreamed up out of nothing... The SCORE      continuing to sway and taking us right up to...154   Sebastian and Mia, husband and wife, father and mother,      hiring a babysitter because they've decided to go out for a      night at the movies... (We're back to 35mm now.) The look      here is unaffected, just everyday. The MUSIC quiets slightly,      everything goes more natural, as this happily married couple      hit the road...155   ...then find themselves blocked by a traffic jam...then take      a side route, winding up in another part of L.A...156   ...then walk down the street, then hear music -- a jazz combo      playing somewhere...157   ...and step into a place that looks just like Sebastian's      club... They sit down to listen...      And then -- and this is how our imagined montage-musical      number ends -- the combo's PIANIST, who of course is not      Sebastian, launches into Mia and Sebastian's melody...      ...and Mia and Sebastian look at each other, recognizing it.      The music goes full-circle, back to where it started, as Mia      and Sebastian look into each other's eyes, lean in and,      softly, but with all the love in the world...                                Revision                           85.158   WE CUT BACK TO THE PIANO: Sebastian has just finished his      piece. We're back to reality. The audience in the club      applauds.      Beat. Mia looks at Sebastian. Looks away. A moment passes.                 Do you want to stay for another?      She's silent for a second. Then she looks at David.                 No... We should go.      He nods. They rise from their seats and head for the exit.      Just as they reach the door, and as David steps out, Mia turns      and looks back at Sebastian. He looks at her. Their eyes lock.      A hint of a tear in both...      And, ever so subtly, for just a fleeting second, Mia smiles.      It's the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked -- but      it's enough to signal to Sebastian that she recognized the      melody he played, and that she still remembers it, and still      thinks of it to this day...      Then she walks out the door. Sebastian glances at his fellow      musicians. Then, he nods, and they launch into a new chart.       It's silent outside. You can't hear the music. Mia and David      reach their car. They get in. It pulls out.      Passing by Sebastian's club, the car continues on. We stay put,      the jazz club on one side of the frame, the lights of the car      on the other. Those lights growing smaller and smaller, before      finally disappearing into the big L.A. night...

"   ""FORREST GUMP"" -- by Eric Roth                                          Screenplay by                                        Eric Roth                                   Based on a novel by                                      Winston Groom                 A feather floats through the air. The falling feather.               A city, Savannah, is revealed in the background. The feather                floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down                toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive                by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder.               He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked                back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car.                The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward                the street.               The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying                back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather                floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's                mudsoaked shoe.               The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is                FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a                box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case.               Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a                pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items.               Forrest pulls out a book titled ""Curious George,"" then places                the feather inside the book. Forrest closes the suitcase.               Something in his eyes reveals that Forrest may not be all                there.               Forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard.               A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus                continues on.               A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at                the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a                magazine as Forrest looks at her.                          Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.               He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse.                          You want a chocolate?               The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this                strange man next to her.                          I could eat about a million and a                          half of these. My momma always said,                          ""Life was like a box of chocolates.                         You never know what you're gonna                          get.""               Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's                shoes.                          Those must be comfortable shoes.                          I'll bet you could walk all day in                          shoes like that and not feel a thing.                          I wish I had shoes like that.                          My feet hurt.                          Momma always says there's an awful                          lot you could tell about a person by                          their shoes. Where they're going.                         Where they've been.               The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his                own shoes.                          I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I                          think about it real hard I could                          remember my first pair of shoes.               Forrest closes his eyes tightly.                          Momma said they'd take my anywhere.                A little boy closes his eyes tightly. It is young Forrest as                he sits in a doctor's office.                          She said they was my magic shoes.               Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg                braces.                          All right, Forrest, you can open                          your eyes now. Let's take a little                          walk around.               The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around                stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS. GUMP, watches him as he clanks                around the room awkwardly.                          How do those feel? His legs are                          strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've                          ever seen. But his back is as crooked                          as a politician.               Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump.                          But we're gonna straighten him right                          up now, won't we, Forrest?               A loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls.                          Forrest!                Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street. Forrest                walks stiffly next to his mother.                          Now, when I was a baby, Momma named                          me after the great Civil War hero,                          General Nathan Bedford Forrest...                A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest.               The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded                sheet over his head.               The General is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse.               The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan                members dressed in full uniform.                          She said we was related to him in                          some way. And, what he did was, he                          started up this club called the Ku                          Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in                          their robes and their bedsheets and                          act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks                          or something. They'd even put                          bedsheets on their horses and ride                          around. And anyway, that's how I got                          my name. Forrest Gump.                Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street.                          Momma said that the Forrest part was                          to remind me that sometimes we all                          do things that, well, just don't                          make no sense.               Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. Forrest's                brace is caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and                tries to free Forrest. Two old cronies sit in front of a                barber shop and watch.                          Just wait, let me get it.               Mrs. Gump struggles to pull the stuck brace from the grate.                          Let me get it. Wait, get it this                          way. Hold on.               Forrest pulls his foot out of the grate.                          All right.               Mrs. Gump helps Forrest up onto the sidewalk. She looks up                and notices the two old man.                          Oooh. All right. What are you all                          staring at? Haven't you ever seen a                          little boy with braces on his legs                          before?               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two                old men. Mrs. Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand.                          Don't ever let anybody tell you                          they're better than you, Forrest. If                          God intended everybody to be the                          same, he'd have given us all braces                          on our legs.                          Momma always had a way of explaining                          things so I could understand them.                Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a dirt road. A row of                mailboxes stands left.                          We lived about a quarter mile of                          Route 17, about a half mile from the                          town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in                          the county of Greenbow. Our house                          had been in Momma's family since her                          grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come                          across the ocean about a thousand                          years ago. Something like that.               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the Gump Boarding House                driveway.                          Since it was just me and Momma and                          we had all these empty rooms, Momma                          decided to let those rooms out. Mostly                          to people passing through. Like from,                          oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like                          that. That's how me and Mommy got                          money. Mommy was a real smart lady.                          Remember what I told you, Forrest.                         You're no different than anybody                          else is.               Mrs. Gump heads Forrest to the porch. She bends down to look                Forrest in the eye.                          Did you hear what I said, Forrest?                         You're the same as everybody else.                          You are no different.                           Your boy's... different, Mrs. Gump.                         Now, his I.Q. is seventy-five.                          Well, we're all different, Mr.                         Hancock.               The principal sighs, then stands up.                Forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits.                          She wanted me to have the finest                          education, so she took me to the                          Greenbow County Central School. I                          met the principal and all.               The principal stands in front of Mrs. Gump. Forrest, sitting                left, listens.                          I want to show you something, Mrs.                         Gump. Now, this is normal.               The principal holds up a chart with a designations according                to I.Q. and points to the center of the graph, labeled                ""Normal."" A red line below the normal area is labeled ""State                Acceptance."" The principal points to the section below the                acceptance line labeled ""Below.""                          Forrest is right here. The state                          requires a minimum I.Q. of eighty to                          attend public school, Mrs. Gump.                         He's gonna have to go to a special                          school. Now, he'll be just fine.                          What does normal mean, anyway? He                          might be a bit on the slow side, but                          my boy Forrest is going to get the                          same opportunities as everyone else.                         He's not going to some special school                          to learn to how to re-tread tires.                          We're talking about five little points                          here. There must be something can be                          done.                Forrest sits outside the principal's office.                          We're a progressive school system.                         We don't want to see anybody left                          behind.                           Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?                          He's on vacation.                Forrest sits on a swing outside the house. Loud organic male                grunts are heard coming from inside the house. Forrest sits                on the swing as the grunts continue. The principal steps out                of the Gump House and wipes the sweat from his face.               Forrest is sitting on the porch.                          Well, your momma sure does care about                          your schooling, son. Mm-mm-mm.               The principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back                at Forrest.                          You don't say much, do you?               Forrest grunts, imitating him. The principal, embarrassed,                turns and walks away.                Mrs. Gump reads from the book ""Curious George"" as Forrest                sits on the bed and listens.                          Finally, he had to try it. It looked                          easy, but, oh, what happened. First                          there...                          Momma, what's vacation mean?                          Vacation?                          Where Daddy went?                          Vacation's when you go somewhere,                          and you don't ever come back.               Forrest lies down on his bed and looks up.                          Anyway, I guess you could say me and                          Momma was on our own.                A cab driver closes the trunk of the car as two women walk                toward the house. A milkman steps down from the porch.                          But we didn't mind. Our house was                          never empty. There was always folks                          comin' and goin'.                          Suppa.                Mrs. Gump steps forward and speaks to all the boarders.                          It's suppa, everyone. Forrest...               A MAN WITH A CANE steps left across the hall.                          My, my. That sure looks special.               Mrs. Gump looks into a sitting room and informs the boarders                about dinner.                          Gentlemen, would you care to join us                          for supper? Hurry up and get it before                          the flies do. I prefer you don't                          smoke that cigar so close to mealtime.                          Sometimes we had so many people                          stayin' with us that every room was                          filled with travelers. You know,                          folks livin' out of their suitcases,                          and hat cases, and sample cases.                          Well, you go ahead and start. I can't                          find Forrest.               Mrs. Gump walks up the stairs.                          Forrest... Forrest...                          One time a young man was staying                          with us, and he had him a guitar                          case.               Mrs. Gump looks into Forrest's room. She hears singing coming                from another room and walks over to a closed door. Mrs. Gump                opens the door, revealing a young man with long sideburns as                he plays the guitar and sings. Forrest holds onto a broom                and dances oddly. The young man is ELVIS PRESLEY.                               (sings)                         ""Well, you ain't never caught a                          rabbit, and you ain't no friend of                          mine.""               Forrest's legs rock back and forth to the guitar.                          Forrest! I told you not to bother                          this nice young man.                          Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I                          was just showin' him a thing or two                          on the guitar here.                          All right, but your supper's ready                          if y'all want to eat.                          Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you,                          ma'am.               Mrs. Gump leaves and closes the door. Elvis sits back down.               Forrest stands left, and looks himself in a mirror.                          Say, man, show me that crazy little                          walk you just did there. Slow it                          down some.               Forrest begins to dance again as Elvis plays the guitar and                sings.                               (sings)                         ""You ain't nothin' but a hound, hound                          dog...""                          I liked that guitar.               Forrest dances as he watches himself in the mirror.                          It sounded good.                               (sings)                         ""...cryin' all the time""               Forrest rocks up and down on his braced legs, then begins to                step.                               (sings)                         ""You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...""                          I started moving around to the music,                          swinging my hips. This one night me                          and Momma...                Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a sidewalk. A television                inside a store window reveals Elvis Presley as he performs                ""Houng Dog"" on a stage.                          ...was out shoppin', and we walked                          right by Benson's Furniture and                          Appliance store, and guess what.               The television reveals Elvis as he thrusts his hips and sings.                               (sings)                         You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...               Mrs. Gump and Forrest watch the television. Elvis dances                around in the same manner Forrest did. A woman in the audience                screaming and applauding.                               (sings)                         You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...                          This is not children's eyes.               Mrs. Gump walks away, pulling Forrest with her. Forrest stops                and takes one last look. Elvis continues to perform over the                television.                               (sings)                         ""Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit                          and you ain't no friend of mine.""                          Some years later, that handsome young                          man who they called ""The King,"" well,                          he sung too many songs, had himself                          a heart attack or something.                Forrest is still sitting on the bus bench. The black nurse                looks at him.                          Must be hard being a king. You know,                          it's funny how you remember some                          things, but some things you can't.                Mrs. Gump and Forrest wait for the school bus. The bus pulls                up as Mrs. Gump prepares Forrest for his first day of school.                          You do your very best now, Forrest.                          I sure will, Momma.                          I remember the bus ride on the first                          day of school very well.               The bus driver opens the door and looks down. Forrest walks                to the steps of the bus and looks at the bus driver. She is                smoking a cigarette.                          Are you comin' along?                          Momma said not to be taking rides                          from strangers.                          This is the bus to school.                          I'm Forrest Gump.                          I'm Dorothy Harris.                          Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.               The bus driver smiles as Forrest steps up into the bus.                Forrest steps up onto the bus. Mrs. Gump waves to Forrest as                the bus drives away. Forrest begins to walk down the aisle.               TWO YOUNG BOYS look up from the seat.                          This seat's taken.                          It's taken!               Forrest looks around. A larger girl slides over so Forrest                can't sit next to her. She shakes her head. Forrest looks to                the other side where a boy sits alone on a larger seat. They                boy glares up at Forrest.                          You can't sit here.                          You know, it's funny what a young                          man recollects. 'Cause I don't                          remember being born.                Forrest continues talking as he sits on the bus bench.                          I, I... don't recall what I got for                          my first Christmas and I don't know                          when I went on my first outdoor                          picnic. But, I do remember the first                          time I heard the sweetiest voice...                Young Forrest is still standing in the aisle on the bus.                          ...in the wide world.                          You can sit here if you want.               Forrest looks back at JENNY CURRAN, a young girl about                Forrest's age.                          I had never seen anything so beautiful                          in my life. She was like an angel.                          Well, are you gonna sit down, or                          aren't ya?               Forrest sits down next to Jenny.                          What's wrong with your legs?                          Um, nothing at all, thank you. My                          legs are just fine and dandy.                          I just sat next to her on that bus                          and had conversation all the way to                          school.                          Then why do you have those shoes on?                          My momma said my back's crooked like                          a question mark. These are going to                          make me as straight as an arrow.                         They're my magic shoes.                          And next to Momma, no one ever talked                          to me or asked me questions.                          Are you stupid or something.                          Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.               Jenny puts her hand out toward Forrest. Forrest reaches over                and shakes her hand.                          I'm Jenny.                          I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.                          From that day on, we was always                          together. Jenny and me was like peas                          and carrots.                Young Jenny and Forrest run toward a large oak tree.                          She taught me how to climb...               Jenny sits on a large branch and calls down to Forrest.                          Come on, Forrest, you can do it.               Forrest dangles from the branch.                          ...I showed her how to dangle.               Jenny and Forrest sit on a tree branch and read.                          ""...a good little monkey and...""                          She helped me to learn how to read.               Forrest hangs upside down from a branch and swings back and                forth. Forrest's braces are wedged in the tree.                          And I showed her to swing.                The silhouete of the oak tree, Jenny and Forrest as they sit                on a branch.                          Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait                          for the stars.                          Momma's gonna worry about me.               Jenny puts her hand on Forrest's hand.                          Just stay a little longer.                          For some reason, Jenny didn't never                          want to go home.                          Okay, Jenny. I'll stay.                          She was my most special friend.                Forrest nods as he remembers.                          My only friend.               Forrest continues talking to the black woman. She doesn't                seem to be listening as she reads her magazine. She looks up                from her magazine.                          Now, my Momma always told me that                          miracles happen every day. Some people                          don't think so, but they do.                Jenny and Forrest walk. A dirt clod hits Forrest in the back                of the head. Jenny looks as Forrest rubs his head. THREE                YOUNG BOYS get off their bikes and pick up more rocks.                          Hey... dummy!               Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod. Forrest                falls backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him.                          Are you retarded, or just plain                          stupid?                          Look, I'm Forrest Gump.               Jenny helps Forrest back up. Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more                dirt clods at Forrest.                          Just run away, Forrest.               Another dirt clod hits Forrest in the arm.                          Run, Forrest!               Forrest tries to run along the road, but his braces makes it                impossible. He hobbles along as Jenny yells after him.                          Run away! Hurry!               Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes.                          Get the bikes!                          Hurry up!               The boys pick up their bikes and ride after Forrest.                          Let's get him! Come on!                          Look out, dummy, here we come!               The boys ride after Forrest. Jenny stands and watches.                          We're gonna get you!                          Run, Forrest! Run!               Forrest hobbles along the dirt road.                          Run, Forrest!               Forrest looks over his shoulder. The three boys race on their                bikes.                          Come back here, you!               Forrest begins to run faster with his braces on. Forrest                continues running as the boys chase him. Blood drips down                from a cut on his head. The boys on the bikes are gaining on                Forrest. Forrest hobbles along. He begins to gain speed.                          Run, Forrest! Run!                Forrest runs from the chasing room. He looks over his shoulder                in fear.               The boys on the bikes peddle faster as they gain on Forrest,                running.               Forrest tries to run even faster to get away. Suddenly his                braces shatter, sending steel and plastic flying into the                air.               Forrest runs and look down at his legs in surprise.               Forrest continues to run faster as the metal braces and straps                fly off his legs.               Forrest runs free of his braces and begins to pick up speed.               The chasing boys ride over the remains of Forrest's braces.                          Now, you wouldn't believe it if I                          told you.                           But I can run like the wind blows.               The black woman continues to read her magazine. Forrest smiles                as he remembers.                          From that day on, if I was going                          somewhere, I was running!                Forrest sprints away from the boys. The boys stop the chase                and watch in disbelief. Forrest is already at the far end of                the road, clear of the chasing boys.                          He's gettin' away! Stop him!               Boy #1 throws his bike down in frustration. Forrest runs                across a field.                Forrest runs past a chain gang in their prison uniforms.               They are cutting at the weeds on the side of the road.                Forrest runs across the street. THE TWO OLD MEN sit in front                of the barber shop.                          That boy sure is a running fool.                Forrest runs down a driveway toward Jenny's small house.                          Now remember how I told you that                          Jenny never seemed to want to go                          home? Well, she lived in a house                          that was as old as Alabama. Her Momma                          had gone up to heaven when she was                          five and her daddy was some kind of                          a farmer.               Forrest knocks on Jenny's door.                          Jenny? Jenny?               Forrest look around the field at the left. He notices Jenny                and runs toward her.                          He was a very lovin' man. He was                          always kissing and touchin' her and                          her sisters. And then this one time,                          Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to                          school.               Forrest runs to Jenny.                          Jenny, why didn't you come to school                          today?                          Hsh! Daddy's takin' a nap.               Jenny grabs Forrest's hand and runs into the field. Jenny's                DAD drunk, steps out onto the porch and shouts.                          Jenny!                          Come on!                          Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd                          better come back here, girl!               Jenny's dad steps out toward the field. Jenny leads Forrest                into the thick tobacco field. Jenny's dad runs through the                field searching for Jenny with a liquor bottle in his hand.                          Where you at?               Jenny and Forrest run into a corn field as Jenny's dad tries                to chase her.                          Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny!               Jenny drops to her knees and pulls Forrest down with her.                          Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.                          Jenny!                          Dear God, make me a bird so I can                          fly far, far, far away from here.                         Dear God, make me a bird so I can                          fly far, far, far away from here.                          Momma always said that God is                          mysterious.                          Jenny! Get back here!                          He didn't turn Jenny into a bird                          that day. Instead...                A police officer escorts Jenny to her grandmother's trailer.               Jenny's grandmother meets Jenny outside and leads her toward                the trailer.                          ...he had the police say Jenny didn't                          have to stay in that house no more.                         She went to live with her grandma                          just over on Creekmore Avenue, which                          made me happy 'cause she was so close.                Jenny climbs over a second-floor railing and enters the house.                          Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out and                          come over to my house, just 'cause                          she said she was scared. Scared of                          what, I don't know...                Jenny lies in bed next to young Forrest. She hugs him.                          ...but I think it was her grandma's                          dog. He was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny                          and me was best friends...                Forrest and Jenny are teenagers now. They walk along an                oaklined road.                          ...all the way to high school.               Suddenly Forrest is hit in the back with a rock. Forrest and                Jenny turn around.                          Hey, stupid!                          Quit it!               A teenage boy throws another rock as a pickup truck pulls up                behind him. Jenny turns and looks at Forrest.                          Run, Forrest, run!                          Hey. Did you hear me, stupid?                          Run, Forrest!               Forrest drops his books and runs down the road. The teenage                boy jumps into the back of the pickup truck with another boy                as the truck speeds after Forrest. Jenny steps left and gets                out of the way.                          Come on, he's getting away! Move it!                          Run, Forrest! Run!                          You better be runnin', stupid.               Forrest runs along the road. The truck speeds after him.                          Come on, dummy!                          Haul ass, dummy!               Older Boy throws rocks at Forrest.                          Yeah, you better be runnin'!                           Ya-hoo!                The boys in the back of the truck throw rocks at Forrest as                they drive up to him.                          Move it, jack rabbit!               The truck follows right on Forrest's heels. A rebel flag                license plate adorns the truck's grill.                          Come on!               Forrest runs along the road as the truck chases him. The                boys in the back of the truck pound on the roof as the truck                turns right, after Forrest. The truck drives into a field.               Forrest runs toward a fence.                          Run! Faster! Yeah! Go! Go! Come on,                          Forrest! Yeah!                          Run, Forrest!               Forrest leaps over a five-foot fence as the boys try to catch                him.                Forrest looks left as he continues telling his life story.                          Now, it used to be, I ran to get                          where I was goin'. I never thought                          it would take me anywhere.                Forrest runs along the road in front of the high school. The                truck continues to chase him as the boys pound on the roof.                          Come on. Whoo-hoo!               The truck speeds past Forrest as he turns from the road and                runs onto the high school football field. Forrest runs across                the field during a football scrimmage.               In the stands watching the scrimmage is the legendary                University of Alabama football coach BEAR BRYANT, wearing                his trademark plaid hat.               A group of assistant coaches sit around him, as well as the                high school football coach. The quarterback throws the ball                into the air.               Forrest runs past the quarterback. The receiver catches the                ball. Forrest runs past the receiver as an opposing player                tackles the stunned receiver.               The football coach stands, followed by the assistant coaches.                          Who in the hell is that?                          That there is Forrest Gump. Coach.                         Just a local idiot.               Forrest runs under the field goal post and through the end                zone.                          And can you believe it? I got to go                          to college, too.                The crowd roars with excitement as a football is kicked off.               The football players run around on the field. The crowd of                cheering fans create a huge sign that reads: ""GO.""               Forrest is in a University of Alabama football uniform. He                looks up into the cheering crowd as his teammate fields the                kickoff. The teammate runs over to Forrest and hands him the                ball.                          Okay! Run!               The football coach, the assistants, and Alabama players cheer                for Forrest.                          Run, you stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run!               Forrest runs across the field. He speeds past the defending                players. Forrest runs past the opposite players. The crowd                cheers wildly, holding up cards, making a large sign that                reads: ""Go.""               They turn the cards over, creating the word: ""ALABAMA."" The                football coach runs along the sidelines as he yells.                          You stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run! Go!                         Run!               Forrest cuts and runs toward the sidelines. Two opposing                players collide. The football coach, the assistants and the                players all motion for Forrest to run toward the end zone.                          Run! Turn! Go!               Forrest turns up the sidelines and runs toward the end zone.               Some opposing players fall down. Forrest runs along the                sidelines. The opposing players try to catch him.               Forrest runs into the end zone as an opposing player dives                at his feet. The referee holds up his arm, signaling a touch                down. The crowd cheers wildly.               Forrest continues to run, smashing through the band members,                then all the way toward the team tunnel. The football coach                looks at an assistant coach.                          He must be the stupidest son-of-a-                         bitch alive. But he sure is fast!                          Now, maybe it was just me but college                          was very confusing times.                An anchorman named CHET HUNTLEY appears over the television.                               (on TV)                         Federal troops enforcing a court                          order integrated the University of                          Alabama today.                Forrest walks through a crowd of people.                          Governor George Wallace had carried                          out his symbolic threat to stand in                          the schoolhouse door.                          We hereby denounce and forbid this                          illegal and unwarranted action by                          the central government.                A black & white television reveals George Wallace as he stands                in the doorway of the schoolhouse.                               (on TV)                         Governor Wallace, I take it from                          that, uh...                Forrest steps over to a young man as the crowd looks at the                demonstration.                          ...statement that you are going to                          stand in that door, and that you are                          not going to carry out the orders of                          this court, and that you are going                          to resist us from doing so. I would                          ask you once again to responsibility                          step aside and if you do not, I'm                          going to assure you...                          Earl, what's going on?                          Coons are tryin' to get into school.                          Coons? When raccoons try to get on                          our back porch, Momma just chase 'em                          off with a broom.                          Not raccoons, you idiot, niggas. And                          they want to go to school with us.                          With us? They do?               Forrest walks toward the schoolhouse.                A football coach looks at a black and white television as a                newsman outside the schoolhouse speaks to the camera.                               (on TV)                         ...block the doorway, President                          Kennedy ordered the Secretary of                          Defense then to use the military                          force.                The footage cuts to Governor Wallace as he speaks to General                Graham.                          Here by videotape is the encounter                          by General Graham, Commander of the                          National Guard, and Governor Wallace.               Forrest stands next to George Wallace and listens.                          We must have no violence today, or                          any other day, because these National                          Guardsmen are here today as Federal                          Soldiers for Alabamans. And they                          live within our borders and they are                          all our brothers. We are winning in                          this fight because we are awakening                          the American people to the dangers                          that we have spoken about so many                          times, just so evident today, the                          trend toward military dictatorship                          in this country.                Some of the Alabama policeman and citizens clap their hands                as the National Guardsmen stand at attention with their                weapons in front of them. Forrest walks through the crowd.               Two black students were being led toward the schoolhouse.                          And so at day's end the University                          of Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been                          desegregated and students Jimmy Hood                          and Vivian Malone had been signed up                          for summer classes.               The young black girl drops one of her books. Forrest notices                and steps past the policeman toward the book on the ground.               Forrest steps out from the crowd and picks up the book. He                brings it up to the girl.                          Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am.                A coach looks at the television. The television reveals                Forrest as he stands at the schoolhouse door. He looks around,                then waves.                               (on TV)                         Governor Wallace did what he promised                          to do. By being on the Tuscaloosa                          campus, he kept the mob from gathering                          and prevented violence.               An assistant coach looks at the television, then at the other                coaches.                          Say, wasn't that Gump?               The football coach and two assistant coaches look. Forrest                dries himself off with a towel as he steps from the showers.                               (on TV)                         NBC News will present a special                          program on the Alabama integration                          story at 7:30 p.m. tonight...                          Naw, that couldn't be.                          It sure as hell was.                          ...standard Eastern Daylight Time.                         Now a word from Anacin.               Forrest steps up to the coaches' area and grabs a clean towel.               The coaches turn and stare at Forrest. Forrest gives them                one of his silly waves, then walks away.               COLOR FOOTAGE - Governor Wallace waves to the crowd as he                stands behind a podium with his wife.                          A few years later, that angry little                          man at the schoolhouse door thought                          it would be a good idea, and ran for                          President.               COLOR FOOTAGE - Governor Wallace mingles in a crowd. Gunshots                are fired, wounding him. Some men wrestle the shooter. Wallace                lies wounded on the ground.                          But, somebody thought that it wasn't.                Forrest sits on the bench as the black woman looks at him. A                WHITE WOMAN with a bay sits left.                          But he didn't die.               A bus pulls up to the bus stop. The BLACK WOMAN looks down                at her watch.                          My bus is here.                          Is it the number 9?                          No, it's the number 4.               The Black Woman gets up and steps over to the bus.                          It was nice talkin' to you.               The white woman sits closer to Forrest.                          I remember when that happened, when                          Wallace got shot. I was in college.                          Did you go to a girls' college, or                          to a girls' and boys' together                          college?                          It was co-ed.                          'Cause Jenny went to a college I                          couldn't go to. It was a college                          just for girls.                Forrest sits outside Jenny's dorm in the rain.                          But, I'd go and visit her every chance                          I got.               A car pulls up. A song is heard from the radio. Forrest,                holding a box of chocolates, looks at the car. The two people                inside the car begins to kiss and embrace each other. Jenny                is inside the car with a boy. She leans back against the                passenger side door as they struggle to get comfortable.                          Ouch! That hurts.               Forrest gets up and runs toward the car. He tries to look in                the window as he steps over to the driver's side door. He                opens the door and begins to punch the boy inside. Jenny                jump out of the car and runs over to Forrest.                          Forrest! Forrest! Forrest, stop it!                         Stop it!                          Jesus!                          What are you doing?                          He was hurtin' you.               Jenny's date, named BILLY, gets out of the car angrily.                          What the hell is going on here?                          No, he's not!                          Who is that? Who is that?                          Get over there!               Jenny turns and looks at Billy. He shoves Jenny's hands away                from him.                          Billy, I'm sorry.                          What in the hell, git, would you git                          away from me!                          Don't... Wait a second!                          Git, just git away from me!                          Don't go! Billy, wait a second!               Billy gets back into the car.                          He doesn't know any better!               Billy pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest.                          Forrest, why'd you do that?               Forrest holds out the box of chocolates.                          I brought you some chocolates. I'm                          sorry. I'll go back to my college                          now.                          Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come                          on.               Jenny grabs Forrest hand and leads him toward the dorm.                Jenny and Forrest sneak to Jenny's door.                          Is this your room?                          Shh!               Jenny unlocks the door and they step inside.                Jenny pulls a robe off of her sleeping roommate's bed. Jenny                hands the robe to Forrest, sitting on Jenny's bed.                          Do you ever dream, Forrest, about                          who you're gonna be?                          Who I'm gonna be?                          Yeah.                          Aren't I going to be me?                          Well, you'll always be you, just                          another kind of you. You know? I                          want to be famous.               Jenny picks up a towel, then walks back toward Forrest. Jenny                dries the water from her hair.                          I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.                         I just want to be an empty stage                          with my guitar, my voice... just me.               Jenny takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to him.               She is only wearing her bra and panties. Forrest looks at                Jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before.                          And I want to reach people on a                          personal level. I want to be able to                          say things, just one-to-one.               Forrest looks down at Jenny's breasts. Jenny realizes that                he is looking at her.                          Have you ever been with a girl,                          Forrest?                          I sit next to them in my home                          economics class all the time.                               (over radio)                         You're listening to WHHY in                          Birmingham, the clear A.M. voice of                          Northern Alabama. I'm Joel Dorn...               Forrest looks at Jenny as she removes her bra. Forrest looks                away, a bit shamed. Jenny takes his hand and guides it up to                her breast.                               (over radio)                         ...coming to you on a night that is                          anything but clear. The weatherman                          says that rain's gonna fall all night                          long so stay with us, get warm, get                          cozy, get under the covers to the                          cool sounds of WHHY.               Forrest looks over at Jenny's breasts, the shudder as he has                an orgasm.                          Ohh... Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.                          It's okay.

Forrest breathes heavily. Jenny puts her bra back on.                          It's all right.               Jenny leans over and puts her head on Forrest's shoulder.                               (over radio)                         Candy is on the line tonight.

Here's more music.                          It's okay.                          Oh, I'm dizzy.               A song is coming over the radio. Jenny hugs Forrest.                          I bet that never happened in home                          ec.                          No.               Jenny laughs and kisses Forrest on the cheek. Forrest and                Jenny hug on the bed as Jenny's roommate pretends to be                asleep, but is listening, horrified, with her eyes open.                          I think I ruined your roommate's                          bathrobe.                          I don't care. I don't like her,                          anyway.                Forrest runs across the field as the defending team chases                him. The crowd yells for Forrest. They flip a sign that reads:                ""Go Forrest.""                          Run! Run! Run!               Forrest runs along the field. The crowd cheers.                          Run! Run! Run!               Forrest runs into the end zone. The band members rush toward                Forrest with their hands up, signaling him to stop. The crowd                flips over cards, creating a sign that reads ""STOP.""                          Stop!               Forrest stops in the end zone as he hears the crowd yells.               The band motions for Forrest to stop and stay in the end               zone. A group of defending players fall over each other in                the end zone. Forrest looks as the crowd cheers wildly.                          College ran by real fast 'cause I                          played so much football.                The White House with the words ""The eyes and ears of the                world Paramount News"" superimposed.                          They even put me on a thing called                          the All-America Team where you get                          to meet the President of the United                          States.                PRESIDENT KENNEDY holds an autographed football as the All-                American Team stands behind him. Forrest is among the players                in suits.                               (over newsreel)                         President Kennedy met with the                          Collegiate All-American Football                          Team at the Oval Office today.                The All-American players mingle around the food table. Forrest                steps up to the table. A large spread of food and soda is on                the table.                          Now, the real good thing about meeting                          the President of the United States                          is the food.               Forrest takes a bottle of Dr. Pepper from the buffet table.               Numerous bottle of Dr. Pepper are displayed on the table. A                servant opens the bottle for him.                          They put you in this little room                          with just about anything you'd want                          to eat or drink. And since number                          one, I wasn't hungry, but thirsty...               Forrest begins to guzzle the Dr. Pepper.                          ...and number two, they was free, I                          musta drank me about fifteen Dr.                          Peppers.               Forrest sets down an empty Dr. Pepper bottle next to a large                number of other empty bottles. Forrest holds his stomach and                burps.               BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE - President Kennedy shakes hands                with the All-American football players.                          Congratulations. How does it feel to                          be an All-American?                          It's an honor, Sir.               Another player steps up to the President and shakes the                President's hand.                          Congratulations. How does it feel to                          be an All-American?                          Very good, Sir.                          Congratulations. How does it feel to                          be an All-American?                          Very good, Sir.               The player walks away. Forrest steps up to the President.               The President shakes his hand.                          Congratulations. How do you feel?                          I gotta pee.               President Kennedy turns and smiles.                          I believe he said he had to go pee.                Forrest urinates in the bathroom, then lowers the lid and                flashes. Forrest washes his hands, then notices an autographed                photo from Marilyn Monroe and a photo of John with his brother                Bobby.                          Sometime later, for no particular                          reason, somebody shot that nice young                          President when he was ridin' in his                          car.               ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - DAY SLOW MOTION - President Kennedy rises                in a convertible and smiles.                          And a few years after that...               ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - Robert Kennedy stands at a podium as people                around him applaud.                          ...somebody shot his little brother,                          too, only he was in a hotel kitchen.                Forrest sits on the bench and shakes his head.                          It must be hard being brothers. I                          wouldn't know.                Students in their caps and gowns step forward the podium to                receive their diplomas. Forrest's name is called. He steps                up and accepts his diploma.                          Forrest Gump.                          Now can you believe it? After only                          five years of playing football, I                          got a college degree.               The dean shakes Forrest's hand vigorously. Forrest looks out                into the crowd.                          Congratulations, son.               Mrs. Gump, sitting in the audience, cries.                          Momma was proud.               Forrest and Mrs. Gump have their picure taken in front of a                large statue. A military recruiter spots Forrest and steps                up to him.                          Forrest, I'm so proud of you. Here,                          I'll hold this for you.               Mrs. Gump takes the diploma from Forrest. The recruiter slaps                Forrest on the shoulder and hands him some military                literature.                          Congratulations, son. Have you given                          any thought to your future?                          Thought?               Forrest looks at a pamphlet with a photo of ""Uncle Sam"" and                the caption ""EXCELLENT CAREERS FOR EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN. Apply                now at your local U.S. Army Recruiting Center.""                          Hello, I'm Forrest...                Forrest steps onto the army bus. Rain pours outside as the                army bus driver yells at Forrest.                          ...Forrest Gump.                          Nobody gives a hunk of shit who you                          are, fuzzball! You're not even a                          lowlife scum sucking maggot! Get                          your faggoty ass on the bus. You're                          in the Army now!               Forrest is about to sit on the first available seat, but the                recruit sitting there refuses Forrest.                          This seat's taken.               Forrest tries to sit on the next seat, but the 2nd recruit                slides over, blocking him.                          It's taken.               Forrest steps forward, looking much like he did on his first                bus ride to school years ago.                          At first, it seemed like I made a                          mistake.               A large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much                like Forrest's, looks up from his seat. His name is BUBBA.                          ...seeing how it was my induction                          day and I was already gettin' yelled                          at.               Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit                down.                          You can sit down... if you want to.                          I didn't know who I might meet or                          what they might ask.               Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief.                          You ever been on a real shrimp boat?                          No, but I been on a real big boat.                          I'm talkin' about a shrimp catchin'                          boat. I've been workin' on shrimp                          boats all my life. I started out my                          uncle's boat, that's my mother's                          brother, when I was about maybe nine.                         I was just lookin' into buyin' a                          boat of my own and got drafted. My                          given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.               Bubba and Forrest shake hands.                          People call me Bubba. Just like one                          of them redneck boys. Can you believe                          that?                          My name's Forrest Gump. People call                          me Forrest Gump.                          So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre,                          Alabama, and his momma cooked shrimp.                Bubba's mother, a robust woman in a cook's uniform, carries                a bowl of shrimp into a dining room. She sets it down on a                table in front of a wealthy white man.                          And her momma before her cooked                          shrimp.                Bubba's grandmother carries a bowl of shrimp into a dining                room. She sets it down on a table in front of a wealthy white                man.                          And her momma before her momma cooked                          shrimp, too. Bubba's family knew                          everything...                           ...there was to know about the                          shrimpin' business.                          I know everything there is to know                          about the shrimpin' business. Matter                          of fact, I'm goin' into the shrimpin'                          business for myself after I get out                          the Army.                          Okay.                A DRILL SERGEANT is in Forrest's face as Forrest stands in                line with the other recruits.                          Gump! What's your sole purpose in                          this Army?                          To do whatever you tell me, Drill                          Sergeant!                          Godamnit, Gump! You're a goddamned                          genius! That's the most outstanding                          answer I've ever heard. You must                          have a godamned I.Q. of a hundred                          and sixty! You are godamned gifted,                          Private Gump!               The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man.                          Listen up, people...                          Now, for some reason, I fit in the                          Army like one of them round pegs.                         It's not really hard. You just make                          your bed real neat and remember to                          stand up straight.                          That is one very intelligent                          individual! You lock your scuzzy                          bodies up behind that private and do                          exactly what he does and you will go                          far in this man's army!                          And always answer every question                          with ""Yes, Drill Sergeant!""                          Is that clear?                          Yes, Drill Sergeant!                The recruits are sitting at the base of their bunks assembling                their rifles. Bubba speaks to Forrest.                          What you do is you just drag your                          nets across the bottom. On a good                          day, you can catch over a hundred                          pounds of shrimp. If everything goes                          all right, two men shrimpin' ten                          hours, less what you spends on gas,                          you can...               Forrest finishes assembling his rifle as the other recruits                are still working on theirs.                          Done, Drill Sergeant!                          Gump!               The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest.                          Why did you put that weapon together                          so quickly, Gump?                          You told me to, Drill Sergeant.               The Drill Sergeant looks at his stop watch.                          Jesus Christ! This is a new company                          record. If it wouldn't be a waste of                          such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd                          recommended you for O.C.S., Private                          Gump. You are gonna be a General                          some day, Gump! Now, disassemble                          your weapon and continue!               The Drill Sergeant walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble                his rifle. After the Drill Sergeant walks past Bubba, Bubba                looks up at Forrest. Bubba continues talking about shrimp in                his slow southern drawl.                          Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is                          the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue                          it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute                          it. There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp                          creole...                Bubba and Forrest shine their boots.                          ...shrimp gumbo, panfried, deep fried,                          stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp,                          lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper                          shrimp...                Bubba and Forrest are on their hands and knees as they scrub                the floor with toothbrushes.                          ...shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp                          salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp                          burger, shrimp sandwich... that's,                          that's about it.                Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly.                          Nighttime in the Army is a lovely                          time.               Forrest lies in his bunk and looks up.                          We'd lay there in our bunks, and I'd                          miss my momma. And I'd miss Jenny.               A young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest.                          Hey, Gump. Get a load of the tits on                          her!               Forrest pick up the magazine and turns the page, revealing                Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all.               The pictorial is titled: ""Girls of the South."" Forrest looks                up with shock. He cranes his head up for a closer look.                          Turns out, Jenny had gotten into                          some trouble over... some photos of                          her in her college sweater. And she                          was thrown out of school.                          ""My baby does the hanky-panky...""                Forrest, in his army uniform, steps into the foyer of the                club.                          But that wasn't a bad thing. Because                          a man who owns a theater in Memphis,                          Tennessee, saw those photo and offered                          Jenny a job singing in a show. The                          first chance I got, I took the bus                          up to Memphis to see her perform in                          that show.               EMCEE steps out onto the stage.                          That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give                          her a big hand, guys. Good job, Amber.                         And now, for your listening and                          viewing pleasure, direct from                          Hollywood, California, our very own                          beatnik beauty, let's give a big                          round of applause to the luscious                          Bobbie Dylan.                          Bobbie... Bobbie...               The emcee walks back off the stage and the curtain opens,                revealing Jenny as she sits on a stool on the stage. She                holds a guitar up and begins to play. She is topless.

Man #5 reaches up and tries to stick some money in Jenny's                shoe.                          Hey, honey, I got something here for                          you.               Jenny kicks his hand. He yells angrily as he sits back down,                then tosses his drink on her.                          Goddamnit!                          Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I'm singing a                          song here. Polly, get out here!                          Hey, show us some stuff, honey!                          Shut up! Oh, shut up!               Forrest walks up to Man #5 and grabs him and tosses him down                on the ground. Man #4 tries to grab Forrest, but Forrest                shoves him down too.                          Forrest, what are you doing here?                          What are you doing?               Forrest climbs up onto the stage and picks Jenny up, guitar                and all, and carries her.                          Come on.                          What are you doing? Forrest, let me                          down!               Jenny struggles and frees herself from Forrest. Forrest steps                back in surprise. Jenny shoves the guitar at Forrest. Jenny                walks off as Forrest holds the guitar. He follows after her.                Forrest follows Jenny over a bridge outside the night club.                          You can't keep doing this, Forrest.                         You can't keep tryin' to rescue me                          all the time.                          They was tryin' to grab you.                          A lot of people try to grab me. Just --                         you can't keep doing this all the                          time!                          I can't help it. I love you.                          Forrest, you don't know what love                          is.               Jenny turns and looks over the bridge.                          You remember that time we prayed,                          Forrest? We prayed for God to turn                          me into a bird so I could fly far,                          far away?                          Yes, I do.                          You think I can fly off this bridge?                          What do you mean, Jenny?                          Nothing.               Jenny turns and looks at the light of an approaching vehicle.               She steps into the street.                          I gotta get outta here.               Jenny runs and flags down the approaching vehicle.                          But wait. Jenny!                          Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?                         You just stay away from me, please.               A pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver.                          Can I have a ride?                          Where you going?                          I don't care.                          Get in the truck.                          So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin' me                          to Vietnam. It's this whole other                          country.               Jenny walks toward Forrest. She looks at the driver.                          Just hang on a minute.               Jenny walks up to Forrest.                          Listen, you promise me something,                          okay? Just if you're ever in trouble,                          don't try to be brave, you just run,                          okay? Just run away.                          Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the                          time.               Jenny takes a last look at Forrest, then climbs into the                truck. Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away.                          And just like that.                Forrest, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out                at a river.                          ...she was gone.               Mrs. Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on                the log. Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's                shoulder.                          You come back safe to me, do ya hear?                The shadow of a helicopter over the rice field below. A                soldier is manning a gun from inside the helicopter. The                solider looks left, Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter.                The helicopter circles overhead, then lands at the firebase.                          ""Some folks are born made to wave                          the flag. Ooh, they're red, white                          and blue. And when the band plays                          ""Hail to the Chief,"" ohh, they point                          the cannon at you all. It ain't me.                         It ain't me. I ain't no Senator's                          son, no. It ain't me. It ain't me...""               Bubba and Forrest jump out of the helicopter with their gear/                They walk and look around oddly.                          Now, they told us that Vietnam was                          gonna be very different from the                          United Sates of America.               The soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases.               He takes two beers out and walks away. In the background,                soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer.                          Except for all the beer cans and the                          barbecue, it was.                          Y'know, I bet there's shrimp all in                          these waters. They tell me these                          Vietnams is good shrimp. You know,                          after we win this war, and we take                          over everything we can get American                          shrimpers to come on here and shrimp                          these waters. We'll just shrimp all                          the time, man. So much shrimp, why,                          you wouldn't believe it.               Lieutenant DAN TAYLOR steps out of a tent. Shirtless, he                holds a roll of toilet paper in his hand.                          You must be my F.N.G.'s.                          Morning', sir!                          Ho! Get your hands down. Do not salute                          me. There are goddamned snipers all                          around this area who would love to                          grease an officer. I'm Lieutenant                          Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fourth Platoon.               Lt. Dan looks at Bubba.                          What's wrong with your lips?                          I was born with big gums, sir.                          Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.                         Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.                          Where you boys from in the world?                          Alabama, sir!                          You twins?               Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, they don't get                the joke.                          No, we are not relations, sir.                          Look, it's pretty basic here.               Lt. Dan starts to walk. Bubba and Forrest grab their gear                and follow him.                          You stick with me, you learn from                          the guys who been in country awhile,                          you'll be right. There is one item                          of G.I. gear that can be the                          difference between a live grunt and                          a dead grunt.               Lt. Dan stops and looks at the boys.                          Socks, cushion, sole, O.D. green.                          Try and keep your feet dry when we're                          out humpin'. I want you boys to                          remember to change your socks wherever                          we stop. The Mekong will eat a grunt's                          feet right off his legs.               Lt. Dan steps over to a large black soldier named SERGEANT                            Sergeant Sims! Goddamnit, where is                          that sling-rope I told you to order.                          I put in requisitions at Battalion.                          Yeah, yeah, yeah, well you call those                          sonabitches again, call them again                          and again and again. I don't care                          how much it takes...                          Lt. Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt                          real lucky he was my lieutenant. He                          was from a long, great military                          tradition. Somebody in his family                          had fought and died in every single                          American war.                A distant relative of Lt. Dan's, wearing a revolutionary war                uniform, falls dead in the snow.                Another relative, wearing a civil war uniform and bearing a                striking resemblance to Lt. Dan, falls down dead.                Another relative, wearing a World War II, falls down dead on                the beach at Normandy.                           Goddamnit, kick some ass!                          I'm on it, Lieutenant.                          Get on it!               Lt. Dan steps back up to Bubba and Forrest.                          I guess you could say he had a lot                          to live up to.               Lt. Dan walks along the walkway and Bubba and Forrest follow.                          So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?                         Well, I've been through there. Little                          Rock's a fine town. Now, go shake                          down your gear, see the platoon                          sergeant, draw what you need for the                          field.               Lt. Dan steps inside the latrine, still holding the roll of                toilet paper.                          If you boys are hungry, we got steaks                          burnin' right here.               Lt. Dan sits down out of sight in the latrine, then stands                up, looking at the boys.                          Two standing orders in this platoon.                         One, take good care of your feet.                          Two, try not to do anything stupid,                          like gettin' yourself killed.               Lt. Dan sits back down out of sight in the latrine. Bubba                and Forrest look at each other.                          I sure hope I don't let him down.                Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon                walk across the rice field. Some Vietnamese rice farmers are                working as the soldiers walk past.                          I got to see a lot of countryside.                          We would take these real long walks.                Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road.                          And we were always lookin' for this                          guy named Charlie. I can't get no                          relief.               Suddenly Lt. Dan holds up his fist, a signal for the unit to                stop. He motions for them to get down.                          Hold it up!                          Hold up, boys!               Forrest gets down and looks around.                          It wasn't always fun. Lt. Dan always                          gettin' these funny feelings about a                          rock or a trail, or the road, so                          he'd tell you to get down, shut up!                          Get down! Shut up!                          So we did.               Lt. Dan motions for the lead soldier to get down. Lt. Dan                crouches down. Lt. Dan looks at the soldiers and points to                his eyes. He lies down on the dirt road and crawls.                          Now, I don't know much about anything,                          but I think some of American's best                          young men served in this war. There                          was Dallas, from Phoenix. Cleveland,                          he was from Detroit.                          Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex. Man, what the                          hell's going on?               Tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know.                          And Tex was, well, I don't remember                          where Tex come from.                          Ah, nothin'. Fourth Platoon, on your                          feet! Still got ten clicks to go to                          that river.               Forrest stands up and begins to walk with the platoon.                          All right, move out! Comin' out.                         Look alive out there.                          The good thing about Vietnam is there                          was always someplace to go.                          Fire in the hole!                Lt. Dan walks away as Forrest rushes over, aims two pistols                in the hole, then climbs inside.                          And there was always something to                          do.                          Mount 'em up.                          Spread out! Cover his back.               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through a rice paddy, waits                deep in water. It begins to rain.                          One day it started raining, and it                          didn't quit for four months.                The rain pours down on Forrest and Bubba as they sit in a                foxhole.                          We been through every kind of rain                          there is. Little bitty stingin'                          rain...               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through the jungle as rain                pours down on them.                          ...and big ol' fat rain.               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon shelters themselves as they walk                through the wind and rain.                          Rain that flew in sideways.               ANOTHER DAY - Forrest and other soldiers walk chest-deep                through a river. The rain splatters back up from the river,                hitting the soldiers. Forrest holds his hand up to protect                his face.                          And sometimes rain even seemed to                          come straight up from underneath.                The rain pours down on the men of the platoon as they sit in                a camp. Bubba sits down next to Forrest.                          Shoot, it even rained at night.               Bubba leans his back up against Forrest's back.                          Hey Forrest...                          Hey Bubba...                          I'm gonna lean up against you, you                          just lean right back against me.                          This way, we don't have to sleep                          with our heads in the mud. You know                          why we a good partnership, Forrest?                         'Cause we be watchin' out for one                          another. Like brothers and stuff.                          Hey, Forrest, there's somethin' I've                          been thinkin' about. I got a very                          important question to ask you. How                          would you like to go into the                          shrimpin' business with me?                          Okay.                          Man, I tell you what, I got it all                          figured out, too. So many pounds of                          shrimp to pay off the boat, so many                          pounds for gas, we can just live                          right on the boat. We ain't got to                          pay no rent. I'll be the captain; we                          can just work it together. Split                          everything right down the middle.                         Man, I'm tellin' you, fifty-fifty.                          And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp                          you can get.                          That's a fine idea.                          Bubba did have a fine idea.               ANOTHER NIGHT - Some soldiers patrol the area. Forrest lies                in a pup tent and writes a litter as the rain pours down. He                uses his flashlight to see.                          I even wrote Jenny and told her all                          about it. I sent her letters. Not                          every day, but almost. I told her                          what I was doin' and asked her what                          she was doing, and I told her how I                          thought about her always.                Jenny steps out of the trailer with a backpack and a guitar.               She hugs a hippie guy, then jumps into the back of a                Volkswagen bus with another guy.                          And how I was looking forward to                          getting a letter from her just as                          soon as she had the time I'd always                          let her know that I was okay.                Forrest writes a letter in his tent.                          Then I'd sign each letter, ""Love,                          Forrest Gump.""                The Fourth Platoon makes their way through the jungle and                rain.                          ""There's something happenin' here.                         What it is ain't exactly clear.                          There's a man with a gun over there,                          telling' me I got to beware.""                          This one day, we was out walking,                          like always, and then, just like                          that, somebody turned off the rain                          and the sun come out.               Forrest looks up as the sun suddenly appears. Forrest's                platoon is attacked. A bullet kills the soldier standing                next to Forrest. Bombs explode all around as the soldiers                scramble to the ground.                          Take cover!               Forrest crawls over a berm as bullets fly overhead and explode                all around him. Forrest rolls over and pulls his pack off                Lt. Dan lies next to Forrest.                          Get that pig up here, goddammit!                          Forrest, you okay?               Two soldiers with a machine gun fire into the jungle. Lt.                Dan shouts into the radio. Forrest begins firing his weapon                into the jungle.                          ...Strongarm, please be advised...               Two soldiers pull a wounded soldier into the jungle.                          Medic, we got a man down!                          Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!                          Roger, Strongarm, be advised we have                          incoming from the treeline at point                          blue plus two. A.K's and rockets...               The machine gunner fires into the treeline. Another soldier                helps him with the ammunition. The machine gun jams.                          Misfire! Misfire!                          Goddammit, Mac! Get that pig unfucked                          and get it in the treeline!               A rocket explodes on the machine gunner and the other soldier,                killing them. Forrest looks down and covers his head as                rockets explodes all around him.                               (into radio)                         Ah, Jesus! My unit is down hard and                          hurting! 6 pulling back to the blue                          line, Leg Lima 6 out! Pull back!                         Pull back!                          Forrest! Run! Run, Forrest!                          Pull back!                          Forrest! Run! Run, Forrest! Run!                         Run!                          Pull back! Let's go!               Lt. Dan gets up and grabs Forrest by the collar.                          Run, goddammit, run!               The platoon gets up and runs toward the cover of the jungle.               Rockets explode all around the field. Forrest runs into the                jungle. The soldiers run through the jungle as bullets explode                all around. A soldier is blown up by a rocket. A soldier                runs through the jungle. Forrest runs past the soldier.                          Medic! Medic! Jesus, can I get a                          medic?                          I ran and ran, just like Jenny told                          me to.               Rockets explode in the jungle as Forrest runs out toward a                clearing.                          I ran so far and so fast that pretty                          soon I was all by myself, which was                          a bad thing.                          Bubba!               Forrest turns around, then runs back into the jungle.                          Bubba was my best good friend. I had                          to make sure he was okay.               Rockets explode in the jungle. Forrest runs back into the                jungle to look for Bubba.                          Any friendlies out there?                          Yeah, I've got three over there.                          Where the hell are you?               Forrest stops and aims his weapon. He looks around, scared.                          Bubba?               Something moves. Forrest turns and looks, then rushes over.                          And on my way back to find Bubba,                          well, there was this boy laying on                          the ground.                          Tex!               Tex lies on the ground, his face distorted with pain.                          Okay.               Forrest reaches down and picks up Tex from the ground. Forrest                pulls Tex up over his shoulder, then runs.                          I couldn't just let him lay there                          all alone, scared the way he was, so                          I grabbed him up and run him out of                          there.               Forrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing.               He sets Tex down on the bank of a river, and runs back into                the jungle.                          And every time I went back looking                          for Bubba, somebody else was saying,                          ""Help me, Forrest. Help me.""               Forrest drops another wounded soldier down at the bank of                the river next to Tex, and then runs back toward the jungle.               Forrest grabs the third wounded soldier up from the ground                and turns him over. It is DALLAS.                          Can't hear... Can't hear...               Dallas is dropped off at the bank next to the other wounded                soldiers. Forrest turns to go back to the jungle.                          No sweat, man. Just lay back. You're                          gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.                          I started to get scared that I might                          never find Bubba.                               (over radio)                         You're danger close for crack air,                          over.               Forrest trips over something and falls to the ground. He                looks up to find two bloody legs. It is Lt. Dan, who is                wounded. He speaks into the radio.                               (into radio)                         Roger, Strongarm, I know my position                          is danger close! We got Charlie all                          over this area! I gotta have those                          fast movers in here now! Over!                               (over radio)                         Six, Strongarm, we want...                          Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!                          I know he's dead! My whole goddamned                          platoon is wiped out!                               (over radio)                         Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6, how copy you                          this transmission? Over.               Forrest tries to pick up Lt. Dan, who tries to push Forrest                away.                          Goddammit! What are you doing? Leave                          me here! Get away. Just leave me                          here! Get out!               Forrest pulls Lt. Dan over his shoulder and runs through the                jungle.                          Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6. This is                          Strongarm, be advised, your fast                          movers are inbound at this time,                          over.                          Then it felt like something just                          jumped up and bit me.               Forrest falls down.                          Ah, something bit me!               Forrest gets up as Lt. Dan yells. Lt. Dan fires his pistol                at the unseen enemy as Forrest pulls him away.                          You dink son-of-a-bitch! I can't                          leave the platoon! I told you to                          leave me there, Gump. Forget about                          me. Get yourself out! Did you hear                          what I said! Goddammit, pull me down!                         Get your ass out of here!               Forrest drops Lt. Dan down at the bank, next to the other                wounded soldiers. Lt. Dan grabs Forrest by the shirt, angry.                          I didn't ask you to pull me out of                          there, goddamn you! What the hell do                          you think you're going?                          To get Bubba.                          I got an air strike inbound right                          now. They're gonna nape the whole                          area.               Forrest gets up and runs as Lt. Dan yells after him.                          Gump, you stay here, goddammit! That's                          an order!                          I gotta find Bubba!               Forrest runs through the jungle searching for Bubba. Forrest                slows down and looks around carefully.                          Forrest...                          Bubba...               Bubba looks up as he lies on the ground.                          I'm okay.               Bubba holds a palm frond over his wound. Forrest removes the                frond to look at the wound. Bubba's chest has been blown                open.                          Oh, Bubba, no...                          Naw, I'm gonna be all right.               Forrest looks around as he hear the voices of the enemy.                          Come on. Come on. Come here...               Forrest carries Bubba through the jungle. The sound of                approaching planes fills the air.                          I'm okay, Forrest. I'm all right.               The roar of approaching planes is deafening. Forrest looks                up in fear. Three planes dive down toward the jungle. They                fire napalm as the jungle explodes with massive fireballs.               Forrest runs, carrying Bubba. The fireballs explode behind                him. The entire jungle area is in flames as Forrest runs.               Forrest carries Bubba to the bank of the river. Lt. Dan and                the other wounded soldiers wait for a rescue helicopter.                          Helo's inbound. Pop smoke, get it up                          there!                          If I'd a known this was gonna be the                          last time me and Bubba was gonna                          talk, I'd a thought of something                          better to say.               Forrest looks down at Bubba. A soldier releases a smoke                canister.                          Hey, Bubba...                          Hey, Forrest. Forrest, why'd this                          happen?                          You got shot.                          Then Bubba said something I won't                          even forget.                          I wanna go home.                          Bubba was my best good friend. And                          even I know that ain't something you                          can find just around the corner.                         Bubba was gonna be a shrimpin' boat                          captain, but instead he died right                          there by that river in Vietnam.               The helicopter fly overhead.                Forrest continues with his life story. A MAN is sitting next                to Forrest on the bus bench.                          That's all I have to say about that.                          It was a bullet, wasn't it?                          A bullet?                          That jumped up and bit you.                          Oh, yes sir. Bit me directly in the                          buttocks. They said it was a million                          dollar wound, but the Army must keep                          that money, 'cause I still ain't                          seen a nickel of that million dollars.                         The only good thing about being                          wounded in the buttocks...                Forrest holds two ice cream cones in his hands as he is                wheeled on a rolling stretcher.                          ...is the ice cream. They gave me                          all the ice cream I could eat. And                          guess what. A good friend of mine                          was in the bed right next door.               Forrest, lying on his stomach, is wheeled to his bed.               Forrest's butt sticks up and is bandaged. Forrest looks at                Lt. Dan lying on the bed. Forrest holds out an ice cream                cone for Lt. Dan.                          Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice                          cream. Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.               Lt. Dan, annoyed, takes the ice cream cone and drops it into                his bed pan. Forrest slides himself onto his bed. A NURSE                reaches toward Lt. Dan.                          It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.               The male nurse places Lt. Dan's hands on a pull-up bar, then                picks up Lt. Dan, whose legs have been amputated.                          Harper...               Another nurse wheels the rolling bed under Lt. Dan. The male                nurse sets Lt. Dan down on the rolling bed. Forrest looks up                at Lt. Dan as he is wheeled away. A soldier reads the names                from a pile of letters.                          Cooper, Larson, Webster, Gump, Gump...                          I'm Forrest Gump.               The soldier hands Forrest a large pile of letters.               ""Undeliverable as addressed. No forwarding order on file.""               Jenny Curran Rural Route 2 Greenbow, Ala. 39902 Forrest looks                down at the pile of letters.                A group of wounded soldiers hang out in the hospital,                recuperating. Forrest sits and watches ""Gomer Pyle"" on the                television.                          Gump, how can you watch that stupid                          shit? Turn it off!                          From the D.M.Z. to the Delta, you                          are tuned to the American Forces                          Vietnam Network. This is Channel 6,                          Saigon.               Forrest turns the TV off and he is hit on the back of the                head by a ping-pong ball.                          Good catch, Gump. You know how to                          play this?               Forrest shakes his head.                          Come on, let me show you. Here.               The wounded ping-pong player hands Forrest a paddle. Forrest                and the wounded ping-pong player step toward the ping-pong                table.                          Now the secret to this game is, no                          matter what happens, never, never                          take your eye off the ball.               He holds the ball up and moves it back and forth. Forrest                keeps his eyes on the ball.                          All right...               The wounded ping-pong player tosses the ball down onto the                table. Forrest begins to hit the ball back to the other                player.                          For some reason, ping pong came very                          natural to me.                          See, any idiot can play.                          So I started playing it all the time.               Forrest hits ping-pong balls.                          I played ping-pong even when I didn't                          have anyone to play ping-pong with.               The balls at land in a bed pan positioned on a chair. A group                of wounded soldier sit and watch Forrest play with himself.                Forrest hits two balls at a time against the opposite side                of the table.                          The hospital's people said it made                          me look like a duck in water, whatever                          that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would                          come and watch me play.               Lt. Dan stares out the window. Forrest lies in his bed asleep.                A hand reaches and grabs him.                          I played ping-pong so much, I even                          played it in my sleep.               Lt. Dan pulls Forrest to the floor, and holds Forrest down.                          Now, you listen to me. We all have a                          destiny. Nothing just happens, it's                          all part of a plan. I should have                          died out there with my men! But now,                          I'm nothing but a goddamned cripple!                          A legless freak. Look! Look! Look at                          me! Do you see that? Do you know                          what it's like not to be able to use                          your legs?                          Well... Yes, sir, I do.                          Did you hear what I said? You cheated                          me. I had a destiny. I was supposed                          to die in the field! With honor!                          That was my destiny! And you cheated                          me out of it! You understand what                          I'm saying, Gump? This wasn't supposed                          to happen. Not to me. I had a destiny.                          I was Lieutenant Dan Tyler.                          Yo-You're still Lieutenant Dan.               Lt. Dan looks at Forrest, lets go of Forrest and rolls.               Lt. Dan sits up as Forrest looks at him.                          Look at me. What am I gonna do now?                         What am I gonna do now?                Forrest plays ping-pong by himself. An OFFICER walks up to                him.                          P.F.C. Gump?               Forrest immediately grabs the ball and places it down on the                table under its paddle. Stands at attention.                          Yes, sir!                          As you were.               The officer holds up an envelope.                          Son, you've been awarded the Medal                          of Honor.                Forrest steps up to Lt. Dan's bed.                          Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they                          want to give me a me...               Forrest stops in mid-sentence as he looks down at the bed. A                heavily bandaged soldier with bloodstains lies there. Forrest                turns and look at the NURSE.                          Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant                          Dan?                          They sent him home.                          Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.                                (on T.V.)                         The ceremony was kicked off with a                          candid speech by the President                          regarding the need for further                          escalation of the war in Vietnam.                          President Johnson awarded four Medals                          of Honor to men from each of the                          Armed Services.               The television reveals Forrest as he is awarded the Medal of                Honor by President Johnson.                          America owes you a debt of gratitude,                          son.               Color footage revealing President Johnson as he places the                award around Forrest's neck and shakes hands.                          I understand you were wounded. Where                          were you hit?                          In the buttocks, sir.                          Oh, that must be a sight.               President Johnson leans and whispers into Forrest's ear.                          I'd kinda like to see that.                The television revealing Forrest as he drops his pants, bends                over and shows the bullet wound on his bare buttocks.               President Johnson looks down and smiles. The three men in                the barber shop look up in disbelief. Mrs. Gump looks up in                shock.                          Goddamn, son.                Forrest walks by the Lincoln Memorial. A fence surrounds the                Memorial, as well as armed military guards.                          After that, Momma went to the hotel                          to lay down, so I went out for a                          walk to see our national capital.                          Hilary, all right, I've got the vets,                          what do you want me to do with them?                          What are you doing here so late?               Forrest takes a photo of the memorial as a woman named Hilary                gathers together some veterans against the Vietnam War.                          We've been waiting for you for half                          an hour, so just get them in a line,                          will you. Hey, hey, come on, pictures                          later. You look great. Oh come on,                          get in this line, come on, come on                          right in line. Come on, let him here,                          let him in here.               Hilary grabs Forrest and puts him in the line with the other                vets against the war.                          It's a good thing Momma was resting,                          'cause the street was awful crowded                          with people looking at all the statues                          and monuments. And some of them people                          were loud and pushy.               Hilary leads the line of vets toward the large anti-Vietnam                War rally.                          Okay, follow me! Come on.               The group of vets walk as Forrest tries to take another                picture. A vet behind him pushes him along.                          Let's move it out.                          Hey, buddy, come on. We could use                          your help.               Forrest walks in the line. A banner reads ""Veterans against                the War in Vietnam.""                          Everywhere I went, I had to stand in                          line.                          Follow me, let's go!               Hilary leads the vets through a crowd of people outside the                rally. Another woman, named Isabel, leads the vets toward                the back of a stage.                          All right, come on, guys.                          Stand here.                          Hey, you're a good man for doin'                          this. Good!                          Okay.               A man, wearing an American flag shirt, stands on the stage.               He is anti-war activist ABBIE HOFFMAN.                          We must declare to that fucking                          impostor in the White House --                          Johnson. We ain't going to work on                          your farm no more! Yeah!                          There was this man, giving a little                          talk. And for some reason, he was                          wearing an American flag for a                          shirt...                          Now, I'm going to bring up some                          soldiers that are going to talk about                          the war, man...                          ...and he liked to say the ""F"" word.                         A lot. ""F"" this and ""F"" that. And                          every time...                          ...that war has come home, and we                          have to stop these politicians...                          ...he said ""F"" word, people, for                          some reason, well, they'd cheer.                          ...these guys just told Lyndon Johnson                          where to stick this fucking war!                          Yeah!               Forrest looks up at the cheering crowd. Abbie turns and                motions for Forrest to come up on the stage.                          Come on, man. Come up here, man.                          Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!               Hilary pulls Forrest up onto the stage.                          Come on, get up there. Come on. Move,                          move. Let's go! Let's go.               The other vets follow Forrest pushes onto the stage and push                him toward the microphones.                          Come on, go. You can do it. Just get                          up there. Go on. That's it.               Thousands of cheering protesters stand around the Washington                Monument. Forrest looks at the crowd. Abbie Hoffmann steps                up to Forrest.                          Tell us a little bit about the war,                          man.                          The war in Vietnam?                          The war in Viet-fucking-nam!               Abbie raises his fist as the crowd cheers wildly.                          Well...                          There was only one thing I could say                          about the war in Vietnam.                          ...there was only one thing I could                          say about the war in Vietnam.               Forrest looks at the crowd as he speaks. A policeman looks                around as he sneaks over to the audio circuit board.                          In Vietnam war...               The policeman pulls the patch cords out of the audio board.               Forrest's amplified voice becomes inaudible. Forrest continues                to speak into the microphone, even though no one can hear                what he is saying. Hilary looks over and notices the                policeman. Hilary rushes over toward the audio board, pushes                the policeman away and grabs his night stick. Another                protester grabs the policeman and pulls him away.                          Hey, what the hell are you doing?                          I'll beat your head in, you goddamned                          oinker!               Isabel, Hilary and another protester try to plug the tangled                mess of wires back into the audio board.                          Christ, what'd they do with this?               Forrest continues to speak into the microphone. The crowd                grows restless.                          We can't hear you! We can't hear                          anything!                          This one! This one! Give me that!               Hilary plugs in the right patch cord.                          That's it.                          ...and that's all I have to say about                          that.               Forrest looks at the massive crowd. They are silent. Abbie                Hoffman steps over to Forrest and pats him on the shoulder.                          That's so right on, man. You said it                          all. What's your name, man?                          My name is Forrest Gump. Forrest                          Gump.                          Forrest Gump!               Abbie raises his fist into the air. Abbie steps away from                Forrest. The crowd cheers.                          Forrest Gump!                               (screaming)                         Forrest! Forrest!               Jenny wades out into the reflection pool and waves her hand                into the air. Forrest recognizes her.                          Jenny!               Forrest rushes off the stage as Jenny makes her way out into                the pool.                          Forrest!               Forrest jumps down into the crowd and runs. Jenny smiles as                she tries to run through the water. The crowd parts as Forrest                runs into the pool. Jenny rushes toward him.                          Hey! Hey!               The massive crowd cheers for the embracing couple in the                pool.                          It was the happiest moment of my                          life.                Forrest and Jenny walk past the protesters who are camping                out on the lawn.                          Jenny and me were just peas and                          carrots again. She showed me around,                          and even introduced me...                Forrest stands at an open window and looks at the White House.                          ...to some of her new friends.               A Black Panther, named RUBEN, steps over and pulls the shades                down.                          Shut that blind, man. And get your                          white ass away from that window.                         Don't you know we in war here?               Another Black Panther named MASAI grabs Forrest and pats him                down.                          Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's                          one of us. He's one of us.                          Let me tell you about us.                          Where the hell have you been?                          I ran into a friend.                          Our purpose here is to protect our                          black leaders from the racial                          onslaught of the pig who wishes to                          brutalize our black leaders, rape                          our women, and destroy our black                          communists.                          Masai, phone. Talk to these guys.                          Who's the baby killer?                          This is my good friend I told you                          about. This is Forrest Gump. Forrest,                          this is Wesley. Wesley and I live                          together in Berkeley, and he's the                          president of the Berkeley chapter of                            Let me tell you something else.                          I want to talk to you.                          Okay, but...                          No. Now! Goddammit!                          We are here to offer protection and                          help for all of those who need our                          help, because we, the Black Panthers,                          are against the war in Vietnam. Yes,                          we are against any war where black                          soldiers are sent to the front line                          to die for a country that hates them.                         Yes, we are against any war where                          black soldiers go to fight and come                          to be brutalized and killed in their                          own communities as they sleep in                          their beds at night. Yes, we are                          against all these racists and imperial                          dog acts.                          You are a fucking asshole!               Wesley hits Jenny across the face. Slow motion -- Jenny falls                back. Slow motion -- Forrest steps forward with rage.               Slow motion -- Wesley turns and looks at Forrest. Forrest                tackles Wesley and slams him onto a table. Jenny turns and                looks as Masai pulls out a gun.                          Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest!                         Stop it!               Jenny rushes over to Forrest and pulls Forrest off Wesley.                          Stop it!               Jenny tries to help Wesley as he moans on the floor. Wesley                knocks Jenny's hand away. He gets up, holding his bloody                lip.                          Oh, God. I shouldn't have brought                          you here. I should have known it was                          just gonna be some bullshit hassle.                          He should not be hitting you, Jenny.                          Come on, Forrest.               Jenny steps out the door as Forrest picks up his hat.                          Sorry I had a fight in the middle of                          your Black Panther party.               The group of Black Panthers glare at Forrest. Forrest turns                and walks out the room.                Forrest and Jenny walk past the White House. Protesters hold                a candlelight vigil behind them.                          He doesn't mean it when he does things                          like this. He doesn't.                          I would never hurt you, Jenny.                          I know you wouldn't, Forrest.                          I wanted to be your boyfriend.               They walk in silence. Jenny touches Forrest's uniform.                          That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You                          look handsome in it. You do.                          You know what?                          What?                          I'm glad we were here together in                          our national capitol.                          Me too, Forrest. I have so much to                          tell you, you won't believe what's                          been going on...                          We walked around all night, Jenny                          and me, just talkin'.                Jenny stands in the rain, hitchhiking. A car pulls over to                pick her up. Jenny and other other girls get into the car.                          She told me about all the travellin'                          she's done.                A hippie gives Jenny a sugar cube of acid as they sit in                front of a roaring fire.                          And how she'd discovered ways to                          expand her mind and learn how to                          live in harmony...                A star with the name ""Jean Harlow"" on the sidewalk. Jenny                and two other girls sing on the sidewalk and collect change                from the passersby. Jenny plays the guitar.                          ...which must be out west somewhere,                          'cause she made it all the way to                          California.                               (sings)                         ""Smile on your brother, everybody                          get together, try to love on another                          right now""               A young hippie looks over his faded Volkswagen at the girls.                          Hey, anybody want to go to San                          Francisco?                          I'll go.                          Far out!                Forrest and Jenny walk through the park.                          I was a very special night for the                          two of us. I didn't want it to end.                Jenny carries a backpack as she prepares to board a bus back                to Berkeley.                          I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.                          I have to, Forrest.                          Jenny? Things got a little out of                          hand. It's just this war and that,                          that lyin' son-of-a-bitch Johnson. I                          would never hurt you. You know that.                          You know what I think? I think you                          should go home to Greenbow. Alabama!                          Forrest, we have very different lives,                          you know.               Forrest looks down at Jenny. He pulls his Medal of Honor                from around his neck.                          I want you to have this.               Forrest places the Medal of Honor in Jenny's hand. Jenny                looks up at him.                          Forrest, I can't keep this.                          I got it just by doing what you told                          me to do.                          Why're you so good to me?                          You're my girl.                          I'll always be your girl.               Jenny and Forrest hug each other. Wesley waits for Jenny.               Jenny turns and walks up to Wesley. They walk toward the                entrance of the bus. Forrest smiles as Jenny looks at her.               Jenny climbs up into the bus. Wesley glares at Forrest.               Forrest gives Wesley the ""evil eye."" Jenny through the near                window of the bus, knocks on the window. Forrest turns and                looks. Jenny waves to Forrest. Forrest looks up and smiles                sadly. Jenny gives Forrest the peace sign as the bus pulls                away. The sign on the back of the bus reads ""Berkeley to                D.C."" Forrest gives Jenny the peace sign.                          And just like that, she was gone out                          of my life again.                A footage of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon on                television.                          That's one small step for man, one                          giant leap for mankind. The, uh, the                          surface is fine and powdery. I can,                          I can pick it up loosely.               Forrest demonstrates a ping-pong to some wounded vets.                          I thought I was going back to Vietnam,                          but instead, they decided the best                          way for me to fight communists was                          to play ping-pong. So I was in the                          Special Services, traveling around                          the country cheering up all them                          wounded veterans and showing them                          how to play...                Forrest looks at a man.                          ...ping-pong. I was so good that                          some years later...                Forrest plays ping-pong against a Chinese player. A large                mural of Mao Tse-tung hangs on the wall. A crowd of communist                leaders sit and watch.                          ...the Army decided I should be on                          the All-American Ping-Pong Team. We                          were the first Americans to visit                          the land of China in like a million                          years or something like that, and                          somebody said that world peace was                          in our hands. But all I did was play                          ping-pong. When I got home...                           ...I was national celebrity. Famouser                          even than Captain Kangaroo.               Color footage of the DICK CAVETT Show. Dick Cavett stands up                as he introduces Forrest.                          Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.               Forrest makes his way onto the stage, shakes hands with Dick                Cavett.                          Mr. Gump, have a seat.               Forrest sits down between JOHN LENNON and Dick Cavett.                          Forrest Gump, John Lennon.                          Welcome home.                          You had quite a trip. Can you, uh,                          tell us, uh, what was China like?               John Lennon lights a cigarette.                          Well, in the land of China, people                          hardly got nothing at all.                          No possessions?                          And in China, they never go to church.                          No religion, too?                          Oh. Hard to imagine.                          Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.               Forrest looks oddly at John Lennon.                          Some years later, that nice young                          man from England was on his way home                          to see his little boy and was signing                          some autographs. For no particular                          reason at all, somebody shot him.                A guard lets Forrest out a side entrance door. Forrest steps,                an then stops as he hears s man sitting in a wheelchair speak                to him.                          They gave you the Congressional Medal                          of Honor.                          Now that's Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant                          Dan!               Forrest looks at Lt. Dan. He is a dirty with long hair.                          They gave you the Congressional Medal                          of Honor!                          Yes sir, they sure did.                          They gave you an imbecile, a moron                          who goes on television and makes a                          fool out himself in front of the                          whole damn country, the Congressional                          Medal of Honor.                          Yes, sir.                          Well, then, that's just perfect!                         Yeah, well I just got one thing to                          say to that. Goddamn bless America.               Lt. Dan's wheelchair begins to slide down the ramp and spins                around on the icy ground. Forrest looks down at Lt. Dan                crashes at the bottom of the ramp.                          Lieutenant Dan!                Taxi cabs crowd the street as Forrest pushes Lt. Dan along                the sidewalk.                          Lieutenant Dan said he was living in                          a hotel. And because he didn't have                          no legs, he spent most of his time                          exercising his arms.                          Take a right, take a right.               A taxi driver honks his horn as Forrest wheels Lt. Dan out                in front of the taxi.                          Hey! Come on already!                          Ah!                          What are you doing here in New York,                          Lieutenant Dan?                          I'm living off the government tit.                         Sucking it dry.               A taxi skids to a stop, almost hitting them as they cross                the street. The taxi honks at Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan slaps the                bumper of the taxi.                          Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind? I'm                          walking here! Ah, get out...                          Why don't you go home before you                          kill yourself? Get out of the way!                          Come on, go! Go! Go!                A Bob Hope Christmas special in Vietnam on television. Lt.                Dan and Forrest watch the television.                          I stayed with Lieutenant Dan and                          celebrated the holidays.                          You have a great year and hurry home.                         God bless you.                          Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?                          I didn't know I was supposed to be                          looking for him, sir.               Lt. Dan chuckles, drinks the rest of a bottle of wine and                tosses it down. He looks at Forrest. He wheels himself over                to television and turns it off.                          That's all these cripples, down at                          the V.A., that's all they ever talk                          about.               Lt. Dan picks up another bottle of port wine, but it is empty.                He tosses it onto the floor.                          Jesus this and Jesus that. Have I                          found Jesus? They even had a priest                          come and talk to me. He said God is                          listening, but I have to help myself.                         Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,                          I'll get to walk beside him in the                          Kingdom of Heaven.               Lt. Dan tosses the empty liquor bottle down and picks another                bottle. He becomes enraged as he throws the bottle and looks                at Forrest.                          Did you hear what I said? Walk beside                          him in the Kingdom of Heaven. Well,                          kiss my crippled ass. God is                          listening. What a crock of shit.                          I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.                          Huh? Ah, well, before you go, why                          don't you get your ass down to the                          corner and get us another bottle of                          wine.                          Yes, sir.                A television shows DICK CLARK as he emcees the Times Square                New York Eve celebration.                          We are at approximately 45th Street                          in New York City at One Astor Plaza.                         This is the site of the old Astor                          Hotel. Down below us, well over a                          hundred thousand people are milling                          about, cheering with horns and                          whistles and hats...                          What the hell's in Bayou La Batre?                          Shrimpin' boats.                          Shrimpin' boats? Who gives a shit                          about shrimpin' boats?                          I gotta buy me one of them shrimpin'                          boats as soon as I have some money.                         I made me a promise to Bubba in                          Vietnam, that as soon as the war was                          over, we'd go in partners. He'd be                          the captain of the shrimpin' boat                          and I'd be his first mate. But now                          that he's dead, that means that I                          gotta be the captain.                          A shrimp boat captain.                          Yes, sir. A promise is a promise,                          Lieutenant Dan.                          Now hear this! Private Gump here is                          gonna be a shrimp boat captain. Well,                          I tell you what, Gilligan, the day                          that you are a shrimp boat captain,                          I will come and be your first mate.                          Okay.                          If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,                          that's the day I'm an astronaut.               Two sleazy women, named LENORE and CARLA, walk up to Lt.                Dan.                          Danny, what are you complaining about?                          What are you doing, huh?                          Mr. Hot Wheels. Who's your friend?                          My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.                          This is Cunning Carla, and Long-Limbs                          Lenore.               Carla puts a ""Happy New Year"" crown on Lt. Dan's head. Lenore                fixes her makeup.                          So where you been, baby-cakes, huh?                          Haven't seen you around lately. You                          know, you should have been here for                          Christmas 'cause Tommy bought a round                          on the house and gave everybody a                          turkey sandwich.                          Well, well, I had, uh, company.                          Hey, hey! We was, we was just there.                         That's at Times Square.               Lenore leans and speaks into Forrest's ear.                          Don't you just love New Year's? You                          get to start all over.                          Hey, Lenore.                          Everybody gets a second chance.                          It's funny, but in the middle of all                          that fun, I began to think about                          Jenny.                               (on television)                         ...getting wild out there. It's                          beginning to...                The New Year's Eve celebration over the T.V.                               (over television)                         ...pour here in Times Square. It's                          been off-and-on all night, but these                          people hang in there.               Jenny fills her bag with her belongings.                          Wondering how she was spending her                          New Year's night out in California.               A man lies passed out on the bed. Jenny looks at her black                eye in a mirror, then leaves the apartment. The TV shows the                ball in Times Square.                               (over television)                The ball is lowered, lighting up a sign that reads ""1972.""                               (over television)                         ...1! Happy New Year!               The people in the bar cheer and kiss each other. They blow                horns and toss confetti into the air. Forrest looks around                as Carla and Lenore lean over and kiss him.                               (sing)                         ""Should auld acquaintance be forgot                          and never brought to mind...                          Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!                               (sing)                         Should auld acquaintance be forgot                          and days of auld lang syne.""                Carla removes her top and sits on top of Dan in his                wheelchair. They kiss and play around. Forrest sits in a                chair. Lenore leaps on him and begins to kiss Forrest. She                reaches down to Forrest's crotch. Forrest stands up nervously,                causing Lenore to fall down on the floor. Lenore stands up,                angry.                          What are you, stupid or something?                         What's your problem? What's his                          problem? Did you lose your pecker in                          the war or something?                          What, is your friend stupid or                          something?                          What did you say?                          I said, is your friend stupid or                          something?                          Hey! Don't call him stupid!               Lt. Dan throws Carla back onto the bed.                          Don't push me like that!                          Hey, don't you push her!                          You shut up! Don't you ever call him                          stupid!                          What's the matter, baby? Why you                          treating me like shit?                          Get the hell out of here!                          You stupid gimp. You belong in                          ""Ripley's Believe It Or Not.""                          Get the hell out of here! Go on!                          You should be in a side show!                          Go on! Get out of here! Get out of                          here!                          You big loser!                          Come on, Lenore. We don't need this                          shit!                          You're so pathetic.                          Get out of here!               Lt. Dan falls out of his wheelchair and lands down on the                floor. Carla and Lenore laugh as they leave the apartment.                          You retard!                          You loser! You freak!               Forrest tries to help Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan pushes Forrest away.                          No!               Forrest steps back as Lt. Dan flips back over, then pulls                himself back up onto his wheelchair. He breathes heavily.                          I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's                          Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tastes                          like cigarettes.                          I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's                          some things you just can't change.                          He didn't want to be called crippled,                          just like I didn't want to be called                          stupid.                          Happy New Year.                An ANCHORMAN reports in front of the White House.                          The U.S. Ping-Pong Team met with                          President Nixon today at an Oval                          Office ceremony...                          And wouldn't you know it...                Forrest looks at the fat man on the bus bench.                          ...a few months later they invited                          me and the ping-pong team to visit                          the White House. So I went again.                         And I met the President of the United                          States again.                A plaque, presented to Forrest, reads ""Presented to Forrest                Gump, member of the United States table tennis team as player                of the year for 1971. President NIXON holds the plaque.                          Only this time they didn't get us                          rooms in a real fancy hotel.                          So are you enjoying yourself in our                          national capital, young man?                          Yes, sir.                          Well, where are you staying?                          It's called the Hotel Ebbott.                          Oh, no, no, no, no. I know of a much                          nicer hotel. It's brand-new. Very                          modern. I'll have my people take                          care of it for you.                Forrest speaks on the phone.                          Security, Frank Wills.               Forrest steps over to a window. Flashlights are moving around                in an office across from Forrest's room.                          Yeah, sir, you might want to send a                          maintenance man over to that office                          across the way. The lights are off,                          and they must be looking for the                          fuse box or something, 'cause them                          flashlights they're, they're keeping                          me awake.                          Okay, sir. I'll check it out.                          Thank you.                          No problem.                          Good night.                          Good night.               Forrest hangs up the phone. The camera tilts down, revealing                the hotel stationary, which reads ""The Watergate Hotel.""                President Nixon makes a resignation speech on TV.                               (over television)                         Therefore, I shall resign the                          Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.               The television cuts to a shot of President Nixon standing                outside Air Force One with his hands in the peace sign.                               (over television)                         Vice President Ford will be sworn in                          as President at that hour in this                          office. As I recall the high hopes                          for America with which we began this                          second term, I feel a great sadness                          that I will not be here in this                          office...               Forrest is playing ping-pong by himself at the gymnasium. An                officer steps up to him.                          Sergeant Gump!                          Yes, sir!                          As you were. I have your discharge                          papers. Your service is up, son.               The officer hands Forrest an envelope, then walks away.                          Does this mean I can't play ping                          pong no more?                          For the Army it does.                          And just like that, my service in                          the United States Army was over. So                          I went home.               Forrest takes his paddle and runs out of the gymnasium.                Mrs. Gump walks out of the house and smiles. Forrest walks                up to the house, wearing his uniform.                          I'm home, Momma.                          I know, I know.                Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk into the house.                          Louise, he's here. He's here,                          everybody.                          Now, when I got home, I had no idea                          that Momma had had all sorts of                          visitors.               In the house are stacks of ping-pong paddles and life-sized                cardboard cutouts of Forrest playing ping-pong. The name on                the ping-pong paddles boxes reads: ""Gump-Mao table tennis.""                          We've had all sorts of visitors,                          Forrest. Everybody wants you to use                          their ping-pong stuff. One man even                          left a check for twenty-five thousand                          dollars if you'd be agreeable to                          saying you like using their paddle.                          Oh, Momma. I only like using my own                          paddle. Hi, Miss Louise.                          Hey, Forrest.                          I know that. I know that. But it's                          twenty-five thousand dollars, Forrest.                         I thought maybe you could hold it                          for a while, see if it grows on you.                          Oh, you look good, Forrest. You look                          real good.                          That Momma, she sure was right. It's                          funny how things work out.                Forrest walks up to a shack on the edge of the Bayou. A group                of black kids play in the front yard.                          I didn't stay home for long, because                          I'd made a promise to Bubba. And I                          always try to keep my promise. So I                          went on down to Bayou La Batre to                          meet Bubba's family and make their                          introduction.               Bubba's mother named MRS. BLUE and her other children look                at Forrest.                          Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?                          Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.                          I guess.                Forrest steps over to Bubba's tombstone.                          And of course, I paid my respect to                          Bubba himself.                          Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump. I                          remember everything you said, and I                          got it all figured out.               Forrest pulls out notes from his pocket.                          I'm taking the twenty-four thousand,                          five hundred and six-two dollars and                          forty-seven cents that I got...                Forrest walks across a yard where men are cleaning shrimp.                          ...well, that's left after a new                          hair cut and a new suit and I took                          Momma out to real fancy dinner and I                          bought a bus ticket and three Doctor                          Peppers.               Forrest walks along a wooden pier. Forrest pays an old black                shrimper a large wad of cash.                          Tell me something. Are you stupid or                          something?                          Stupid is as stupid does, sir.                Forrest stands at the grave.                          Well, that's what's left after me                          saying, ""When I was in China on the                          All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just                         loved playing ping-pong with my Flex-                         O-Ping-Pong Paddle."" Which everybody                          knows it isn't true, but Momma says                          it's just a little white lie so it                          wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway,                          I'm putting all that on gas, ropes                          and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin'                          boat.                Forrest steers his shrimping boat. The boat is old and rusty.               Forrest unleashes his nets as his catch of the day drops to                the deck. It is a bunch of garbage and shells. Forrest picks                up one shrimp.                          Now, Bubba had told me everything he                          knows about shrimpin', but you know                          what I found out? Shrimpin' is tough.                Forrest pulls a couple of shrimp out of a bucket.                          I only caught five.                          A couple of more, you can have                          yourself a cocktail.               The old shrimper begins to walk away, then stops and looks                at Forrest.                          Hey, you ever think about namin'                          this old boat?                          I'd never named a boat before, but                          there was only one I could think of.               Forrest paints a name on the side of his boat. The name is                ""Jenny.""                          The most beautiful name in the wide                          world.                Disco lights flash and people dance. A guy asks a girl to                dance.                          Okay.               Jenny sits at a table with some other people. She is snorting                cocaine.                          Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny in a                          long while. But...                Forrest stands at the helm as the boat glides across the                water.                          But I thought about her a lot. And I                          hoped that whatever she was doing                          made her happy.                Drug paraphernalia and a large wad of cash are spread out on                a table. A man drops a syringe on the table. He reaches over                and touches Jenny. She is pale with dark lines under her                eyes.                Jenny smears some lines of cocaine on a mirror. She looks at                herself in the mirror.                Jenny steps out onto the high-rise balcony. She steps up on                a table and stands on the edge of the balcony. A busy street                lies many stories below. Jenny looks down to the intersection                below.               She slips over the edge, regains her balance, turns and looks                back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from                the edge.               Jenny grabs a hold of the ledge and carefully climbs down.               She sits down on a chair. Jenny rocks back and forth as she                cries. She looks up at the sky.                The moon shines above in the sky. Forrest lies in a hammock                on his boat.                          I thought about Jenny all the time.                Forrest stands at the helm of his boat and slowly glides by                the docks. Forrest looks around and notices something and                bends down to get a clear view. Lt. Dan sits in his wheelchair                on the deck. Forrest looks at Lt. Dan. He smiles, surprised.                          Hi!               Forrest leaps off of his moving boat and into the water. The                boat continues as Forrest clumsily swims. Lt. Dan sits in                his wheelchair at the edge of the dock. Forrest flails his                arms as he swims up to the dock. Lt. Dan waits for Forrest,                smoking a cigar. Forrest climbs up a ladder onto the dock.                          Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing                          here?                          Well, I thought I'd try out my sea                          legs.                          Well, you ain't got no legs,                          Lieutenant Dan.                          Well, well, Captain Forrest Gump. I                          had to see this for myself. And I                          told you if you were ever a shrimp                          boat captain, that I'd be your first                          mate. Well, here I am. I am a man of                          my word.                          Okay.               Forrest shakes Lt. Dan's hand.                          Yeah, but don't you be thinking that                          I'm gonna be calling you sir.                          No, sir.               Forrest's boat glides, crushing a dock. Forrest and Lt. Dan                look at it.                          That's my boat.                Forrest's shrimping boat is alone on the gulf waters.                          I have a feeling if we head the east,                          we'll find some shrimp. So, take a                          left. Take a left.               Forrest looks up. Lt. Dan is sitting in the rigging.                          Which way?                          Over there! They're over there! Get,                          get on the wheel and take a left!                          Okay.                          Gump, what are you doing? Take a                          left! Left! That's where we're gonna                          find those shrimp, my boy! That's                          where we'll find 'em.               Forrest empties the net. Their ""catch"" is debris that falls                to the deck.                          Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.                          Okay, so I was wrong.                          Well, how we gonna find them?                          Well, maybe you should just pray for                          shrimp.                The all-black gospel choir sings and claps their hands.                          So I went to church every Sunday...               Lt. Dan is sitting in his chair at the back of the church.                He takes swigs from a liquor bottle.                          Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too.                         Though I think he left the praying                          up to me.                A catch of junk is dumped onto the deck. Lt. Dan lowers                himself from the rigging.                          No shrimp.                          Where the hell's this God of yours?               The wind begins to blow strong.                          It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,                          'cause right then, God showed up.                Water sprays on deck during a hurricane. Lt. Dan on the                rigging, shouts and shakes his fist as he is pelted by wind                and rain.                          You'll never sink this boat!                          Now me, I was scared. But Lieutenant                          Dan, he was mad.                          Come on! You call this a storm?               Forrest slides back and forth as he attempts to steer the                boat.                          Blow, you son-of-a-bitch! Blow! It's                          time for a showdown! You and me. I'm                          right here. Come and get me! You'll                          never sink this boat!                An ANCHORMAN over TV, is standing in front of a pier.                               (over television)                         Hurricane Carmen came through here                          yesterday...                The anchorman is standing in front of the ruined pier and                boats.                          ...destroying nearly everything in                          its path. And as in other towns up                          and down the coast, Bayou La Batre's                          entire shrimping industry...                           ...has fallen victim to Carmen and                          has been left in utter ruin. Speaking                          with local officials, this reporter                          has learned, in fact, only one                          shrimping boat actually survived the                          storm.               Forrest's boat comes down the river.                          Louise. Louise, there's Forrest!                          After that, shrimpin' was easy.                Lt. Dan and Forrest empty their net. A huge catch of shrimp                falls onto the deck. Lt. Dan opens another big catch.               Another catch drops open on top of yet another huge catch.               Forrest and Lt. Dan smile.                          And since people still needed them                          shrimps for shrimp cocktails and                          barbecues and all...                The man sitting on the bench listens to Forrest. An ELDERLY                WOMAN sits next to the man.                          ...and we were the only boat left                          standing ""Bubba-Gump"" shrimp's what                          they got. We got a whole bunch of                          boats. Twelve Jenny's, a big ol'                          warehouse, we even have hats that                         says ""Bubba-Gump"" on 'em. ""Bubba-                         Gump Shrimp."" It's a household name.                          Hold on there, boy. Are you telling                         me you're the owner of the Bubba-                         Gump Shrimp Corporation?                          Yes, sir. We've got more money than                          Davy Crocket.                          Boy, I've heard some whoppers in my                          time, but that tops them all. We was                          sitting next to a millionaire!               The man laughs as he walks away.                          Well, I thought it was a very lovely                          story. And you tell it so well. With                          such enthusiasm.                          Would you like to see what Lieutenant                          Dan looks like?                          Well, yes, I would!               Forrest shows her the cover of a ""Fortune"" magazine with                Forrest and Lt. Dan on the cover.                          That's him right there.               The elderly woman looks at the magazine and at Forrest with                surprise.                          And let me tell you something about                          Lieutenant Dan.                Forrest and Lt. Dan are working on the boat.                          Forrest, I never thanked you for                          saving my life.               Forrest looks a little surprised. Lt. Dan smiles, then looks                away. Lt. Dan pulls himself out of his chair to the railing                and jumps into the water.                          He never actually said so, but I                          think he made his peace with God.                Forrest and Lt. Dan have dinner on the deck. The television                shows an assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford.                               (over television)                         For the second time in seventeen                          days, President Ford escaped possible                          assassination today when a woman,                          Sarah Jane Moore, fired on him as he                          stepped out of a hotel in San                          Francisco.

(over radio)                         Forrest has a phone call.                          Yeah, well you'll have to tell them                          to call him back. He is indisposed                          at the moment.                               (over radio)                         His momma's sick.                               (over television)                         Lynett Alice Fromme, a follower of                          Charles Manson better known as                          ""Squeaky,"" attempted to assassinate                          the President as he was...               Forrest dives into the water as he reacts.                Forrest carries a suitcase as he runs down the road. Forrest                runs past the row of mailboxes and turns into the drive.               Louise and others are on the front porch.                          Where's Momma?                          She's upstairs.                Forrest opens the door, the doctor stands next to Mrs. Gump                in bed.                          Hi, Forrest.                          I'll see you tomorrow.                          Oh, all right.               The doctor looks down at Forrest's legs.                          We sure got you straightened out,                          didn't we, boy?               The doctor leaves and closes the door. Forrest takes off his                hat and steps over to her.                          What's the matter, Momma?                          I'm dyin', Forrest. Come on in, sit                          down over here.                          Why are you dyin', Momma?                          It's my time. It's just my time. Oh,                          now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.                         Death is just a part of life. It's                          something we're all destined to do.                          I didn't know it, but I was destined                          to be your momma. I did the best I                          could.                          You did good, Momma.                          Well, I happened to believe you make                          your own destiny. You have to do the                          best with what God gave you.                          What's my destiny, Momma?                          You're gonna have to figure that out                          for yourself. Life is a box of                          chocolates, Forrest. You never know                          what you're gonna get.                          Momma always had a way of explaining                          things so I could understand them.                          I will miss you, Forrest.                          She had got the cancer and died on a                          Tuesday. I bought her a new hat with                          little flowers on it.                The elderly woman and Forrest sit. The woman is crying and                wipes her eyes with a hankie.                          And that's all I have to say about                          that.               A bus stops. Forrest looks at the elderly woman.                          Didn't you say you were waiting for                          the Number Seven bus?                          There'll be another one along shortly.                          Now, because I had been a football                          star, and a war hero, and a national                          celebrity, and a shrimpin' boat                          captain, and a college graduate, the                          city of fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,                          decided to get together and offered                          me a fine job.                Forrest rides a lawn tractor as he moves the football field                lawn.                          So, I never went back to work for                          Lieutenant Dan.                Forrest takes out a letter and opens it.                          Though he did take care of my Bubba-                         Gump money. He got me invested in                          some kind of fruit company. And so                          then I got a call from him saying we                          don't have to worry about money no                          more.                           And I said, ""That's good. One less                          thing.""               INT. CHURCH - DAY The choir and members are singing.                          Now, Momma said there's only so much                          fortune a man really needs...                The sign reads: ""Four Square Baptist Church."" A new cross is                placed on the steeple. New furniture is taken inside.                          Praise the Lord.                          ...and the rest is just for showing                          off. So, I gave a whole bunch of it                          to the Four Square Gospel Church.                The sign reads: ""Gump Medical Center Bayou La Batre, Alabama.""               The ribbon-cutting ceremony.                          And I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou                          La Batre Fishing Hospital.                A postman delivers a letter to Bubba's mom. She opens the                letter.                          And even though Bubba was dead, and                          Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts. I                          gave Bubba's mommy Bubba's share.               She is surrounded by her many children. She looks at the                check and faints.                           And you know what...                A door opens as a white woman serves Bubba's mom some shrimp.                          She didn't have to work in nobody's                          kitchen no more.                          Smells wonderful!                Forrest rides the mower.                          And 'cause I was godzillionaire and                          I liked doing it so much. I cut that                          grass for free.                Forrest looks down the road as he steps onto the porch.                          But at nighttime, when there was                          nothing to do and the house was all                          empty, I'd always think of Jenny.               Jenny's image walks, then vanishes. Forrest looks away. He                turns and walks into the house.                Jenny walks across the lawn to Forrest.                          And then, she was there.                          Hello, Forrest.                          Hello, Jenny.                          Jenny came back and stayed with me.                Jenny lies asleep in bed.                          Maybe it was because she had nowhere                          else to go. Or maybe it was because                          she was so tired, because she went                          to bed and slept and slept like she                          hadn't slept in years. It was                          wonderful having her home.                Forrest and Jenny walking.                          Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd                          jabber on like a monkey in a tree.                         And she'd listen about ping-pong and                          shrimpin' boats and Momma makin' a                          trip to heaven. I did all the talkin'.                          Jenny most of the time was real quiet.                          ...big ol' gobs of rain and little                          bitty stinging rain and rain...               Jenny's old house stands at the end of the dirt road. It                appears to be deserted. Jenny walks toward the house and                stops. She stares at the house. Forrest walks toward Jenny.               Jenny suddenly heaves a rock angrily at the house. She throws                other things at the house.                          How could you do this?               She breaks a window. Jenny collapses to the ground and sobs.               Forrest knees down next to her.                          Sometimes I guess there just aren't                          enough rocks.                Jenny and Forrest sit on a limb together.                          I never really knew why she came                          back, but I didn't care. It was like                          olden times. We was like peas and                          carrots again.                Jenny sits by the vase of flowers and look out the window.                          Every day I'd pick pretty flowers                          and put them in her room for her.                Forrest closes his eyes as he sits on the porch. Jenny places                a box of Nike running shoes in his lap.                          And she gave me the best gift anyone                          could ever get in the wide world.                          Okay, you can open your eyes.                          New shoes.                          They make them just for running.                Through the windows, Forrest and Jenny are dancing as it                rains outside.                          And she even showed me how to dance.                         And, well, we was like family...                          Jenny and me.                Jenny and Forrest sit on a log together and look at the river.               Jenny places her arms around Forrest.                          And it was the happiest time of my                          life.               The fireworks explode in the sky.                The Statue of Liberty is shown on the TV. Fireworks go off.               Forrest and Jenny are watching the 4th of July celebration                on TV.                               (over television)                         And this Fourth is witnessing one of                          the largest fireworks displays in                          the nation's two-hundred year                          history...                          You done watching it?                          Mm-hmm.                               (over television)                         ...here in New York Harbor. After                          the spectacular display of tall ships                          earlier, the Statue of Liberty...               Jenny stands up and kisses Forrest on the cheek.                          I'm going to bed.               Jenny turns off the TV and walks outside. Forrest stands as                he puts down his Dr. Pepper. Jenny walks toward the stairs.                          Will you marry me? I'd make a good                          husband, Jenny.                          You would, Forrest.                          But you won't marry me.                          You don't want to marry me.                          Why don't you love me, Jenny? I'm                          not a smart man, but I know what                          love is.               Forrest turns and walks toward the door. Jenny turns and                walks up the stairs. Forrest stands outside.                The house stands in the rain.                Forrest lies in his bed as the door opens. Jenny gets into                bed next to Forrest.                          Jenny?                          Forrest, I do love you.               Jenny and Forrest kiss. Jenny takes off her nightgown as                they make love.                Jenny carries her purse and walks toward a waiting cab.                          Where are you running off to?                          I'm not running.                The cab drives away as Forrest is asleep in his bed. The                Congressional Medal lies on a table by a ping-pong paddle.               Forrest holds a glass of milk and wears his bathrobe. He                looks at the medal he had give to Jenny. Jenny's bed is made.                Forrest stands in the doorway looking at the room and bed                where Jenny had been.                Forrest sit on a rocking chair with his running shoes on. He                is still, as if in a trance. He slowly puts on his Bubba-               Gump cap. Forrest stands. He walks off the porch. He begins                to jog across the lawn. His speed increases as he runs farther                away. Forrest runs down the drive away from his house.                          That day, for no particular reason,                          I decided to go for a little run.               Forrest runs to the end of the drive, then turns right and                runs down the highway.                          So I ran to the end of the road, and                          when I got there, I thought maybe                          I'd run to the end of town.                The three men sit as they watch the television. Forrest runs                through the main street of town.                          President Carter, suffering from                          heat exhaustion fell into the arms                          of security agents.                          And when I got there...                The sign reads ""Entering Greenbow County.""                          ...I thought maybe I'd just run across                          Greenbow County. And I figured since                          I run this far, maybe I'd just run                          across the great...               Forrest runs by a sign that reads ""Mississippi welcomes you.                The Magnolia State.""                          ...state of Alabama. And that's what                          I did I ran clear across Alabama.                           For no particular reason, I just                          kept on going. I ran clear to the                          ocean.                The sign reads ""Santa Monica yacht harbor sports fishing -                boating - cafes."" Forrest runs under the sign and onto the                pier.                          And when I got there, I figured since                          I'd gone this far, I might as well                          turn around, just keep on going.                Forrest runs to a pier at the Atlantic Ocean.                          When I got to another ocean, I figured                          since I've gone this far, I might as                          well just turn back, keep right on                          going.               Forrest runs across the pier. A lighthouse stands at the end                of the pier.                          When I got tired, I slept. When I                          got hungry, I ate.                           When I had to go, you know, I went.                          And so, you just ran?                          Yeah.                Forrest is running along the highway. Forrest runs down a                road between field of wheat. A Mountain river. Forrest runs                across a cobble-stone bridge. The Rocky Mountains are behind                him in distance. Forrest runs through some meadowland.               Split rail fences line the road.                          I'd think a lot about Momma and Bubba,                          and Lieutenant Dan, but most of all,                          I thought about Jenny. I thought                          about her a lot.                The three men in the barber shop watch the news on television.                          For more than two years now, a man                          named Forrest Gump, a gardener from                          Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to                          sleep, has been running across                          America.                Jenny fills customer's coffee cups.                          Charles Cooper brings us this report.                          For the fourth time on his journey                          across America, Forrest Gump, a                          gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, is                          about to cross the Mississippi River                          again today.               The TV shows Forrest runs across a bridge that reads                ""Mississippi River.""                          I'll be damned. Forrest...                           Sir, why are you running?                          Why are you running?                          Are you doing this for world peace?                          Are you doing this for women's right?                          Or for the environment?                          Or for animals?                          Or for nuclear arms?                          They just couldn't believe that                          somebody would do all that running                          for no particular reason.                          Why are you doing this?                          I just felt like running.                           I just left like running.                Forrest runs as a YOUNG MAN runs up to him.                          It's you. I can't believe it's really                          you.                           Now, for some reason what I was doing                          seemed to make sense to people.                The young man jobs behind Forrest.                          I mean, it was like an alarm went                          off in my head, you know. I said,                          here's a guy that's got his act                          together. Here's somebody who's got                          it, all figured out. Here's somebody                          who has the answer. I'll follow you                          anywhere, Mr. Gump.                          So, I got company.               Forrest runs up a slope on a high mountain road. A group of                people are jogging behind him.                          And after that I got more company.                         And then...               A large group jogs behind Forrest across the desert road.                          ...even more people joined in.                         Somebody later told me...                           ...it gave people hope. Now... Now,                          I don't know anything about that,                          but...               Forrest and his followers job through a small town. A man                runs up and talks to Forrest.                          Some of those people asked me if I                          could help them out.                          Hey, man, hey, listen. I was wondering                          if you might help me, huh? Listen,                          I'm in the bumper sticker business                          and I've been trying to think up a                          good slogan. And since you have been                          such a big inspiration to the people                          around here, I thought you might be                          able to help me jump into... Whoa!                         Man, you just ran through a big pile                          of dogshit!               The hippie jumps over the ""dogshit"" as he runs along Forrest.                          It happens.                          What, shit?                          Sometimes.               The hippie stops to ponder this profound thought.                          And some years later I heard that                          fella did come up with a bumper                          sticker slogan...               A bumper sticker reads ""Shit Happens.""                          ...and he make a lot of money off of                          it.               The truck with the bumper sticker drives into an intersection.               It collides with a car.                Forrest runs, followed by his group, as a man runs up to                him.                          Another time I was running along,                          somebody who had lost all his money                          in the T-shirt business, and he wanted                          to put my face on a T-shirt, but he                          couldn't draw that well and he didn't                          have a camera.                          I think it would be really fortunate                          for me if I could get your name on                          these, oh, your face and name on                          these T-shirts. It would be wonderful.               A truck splashes mud onto Forrest as it goes by. The man                hands Forrest a yellow T-shirt to use as a rag to wipe the                mud off.                          Here, use this one. Nobody likes                          that color anyway.               Forrest wipes his face on the towel and hands it back to the                man.                          Have a nice day.               The man looks at the T-shirt. He holds it up displaying the                ""Happy Face.""                          And some years later I found out                          that that man did come up with a                          idea for a T-shirt and he made a lot                          of money off of it.                Forrest runs with a group that follows behind him.                          Anyway, like I was saying, I had a                          lot of company. My Momma always said                          you got to put the past behind you                          before you can move on. And I think                          that's what my running was all about.                         I had run for three years, two months,                          fourteen days, and sixteen hours.               Forrest stops running. The group stops behind him. Forrest                stands and looks as the group waits expectantly. Forrest                turns and look.                          Quiet. Quiet, he's gonna say                          something.                          I'm pretty tired. I think I'll go                          home now.               Forrest walks toward the group. The group parts for Forrest                as he walks down the middle of the road.                          Now what are we supposed to do?                          And just like that, my running days                          was over. So, I went home to Alabama.               A television shows President Reagan and his staff as they                react to gunshots in front of a limo.                               (over television)                         Moments ago, at two twenty-five p.m.,                          as President Reagan was leaving the                          Washington Hilton Hotel...                Forrest sits eating a sandwich, watching the news of the                assassination attempt.                          ...five or six gunshots were fired                          by an unknown would-be assassin. The                          President was shot in the chest and                          the assailant was immediately tackled                          by a half a dozen lawmen. As the                          Presidential...                          I picked up the mail.                          Oh, thank you, Miss, Miss Louise.                          One day, out of the blue clear sky,                          I got a letter from Jenny...                Forrest takes the letter out of his pocket.                          ...wondering if I could come down to                          Savannah to see her, and that's what                          I'm doing here. She saw me on TV,                          running, I'm supposed to go on the                          Number Nine bus to Richmond Street                          and get off and go one block left to                          1-9-4-7 Henry Street, Apartment 4.               The elderly woman looks at the letter.                          Why, you don't need to take a bus.                         Henry Street is just five or six                          blocks down that way.                          Down that way?                          Down that way.               Forrest hastily grabs his suitcase and letter as he stands.                          It was nice talking' to you.               Forrest runs, the elderly woman shouts from the bus stop                bench. A truck honks its horn as Forrest runs across the                street past the truck.                          I hope everything works out for you.                Jenny opens the door.                          Hey! Forrest! How you doing?                          Hi.                          Come in. Come in.                          I got your letter.                          Oh, I was wondering about that.               Jenny shuts the door. Forrest looks around.                          Is this your house?                          Yeah, it's messy right now. I just                          got off work.                          It's nice. You got air conditioning.               Forrest hands Jenny the box of chocolates.                          Ah...                          Thank you.                          I ate some.               Jenny picks up a scrapbook and turns the pages.                          Hey, I kept, I kept a scrapbook of                          your, of your clippings and                          everything. There you are. This, I                          got your running.                          I ran a long way. For a long time.                          There. Listen, Forrest. I don't know                          how to say this. Um, I just... I                          want to apologize for anything that                          I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed                          up for a long time, and...               There is a knock at the door. LYNN MARIE enters as she opens                the door.                          Yoo-hoo.                          Hey.                          Hi.               Jenny grabs a young boy.                          Hey, you. This is an old friend from                          Alabama.                          Oh, how do you do?                          Ah, listen, next week my schedule                          changes, so I'll be able to... but                          thanks for picking up.                          No problem. Got to go, Jen. I'm double                          parked.                          Okay.               Lynn Marie closes the door and waves bye to Forrest.                          Bye.                          Thanks. This is very good friend,                          Mr. Gump. Can you say hi to him?                          Hello, Mr. Gump.                          Hello.                          Now, can I go watch TV now?                          Yes, you can. Just keep it low.               The little boy runs into other room and picks up TV remote                control.                          You're a momma, Jenny.                          I'm a momma. His name is Forrest.                          Like me.                          I named him after his Daddy.                          He got a daddy named Forrest, too?                          You're his daddy, Forrest.               Forrest continues to stare at Forrest Jr. Forrest then looks                frightened and starts to back away.                          Hey, Forrest, look at me. Look at                          me, Forrest. There's nothing you                          need to do, okay? You didn't do                          anything wrong. Okay?               Jenny turns and looks at Forrest Jr. in the other room.                          Isn't he beautiful?                          He's the most beautiful thing I've                          ever seen. But... is, is he smart,                          or is he...                          He's very smart. He's one of the                          smartest in his class.               Forrest breathes deep. He looks at Jenny, then at Forrest                Jr.                          Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.               Forrest walks into the room and sits down next to Forrest                Jr. ""Sesame Street"" is on the TV.                          Oh, great.                          Hey, Bert, can you give me a hand?                          A hand? Well, yeah, what do you want,                          Ernie?                          What are you watching.                          Bert and Ernie.                          Well, it's the first stage. Bert.                          It's planning to write a story, Bert.                          I have pencils right here to write                          with, Bert. Now, we got, uh, paper.                          I'll take that paper, Bert. See, we                          have the paper to write on.                Forrest and Jenny sit on a bench. Forrest Jr. swings behind                them.                          Forrest, I'm sick.                          What, do you have a cough due to                          cold?                          I have some kind virus. And the                          doctors don't, they don't know what                          it is. And there isn't anything they                          can do about it.                          You could come home with me. Jenny,                          you and little Forrest could come                          stay at my house in Greenbow. I'll                          take care of you if you're sick.                          Would you marry me, Forrest?                          Okay.                A group has gathered on the lawn for the wedding. Louise                walks up to Forrest.                          Please take your seats.                          Forrest, it's time to start.               Jenny walks out of the house. Forrest walks over to greet                her. She wears a white dress. She walks up to Forrest and                adjusts his necktie.                          Hi. Your tie.               Lt. Dan is walking across the lawn. He uses a cane. A WOMAN                is walking next to him.                          Lieutenant Dan? Lieutenant Dan!                          Hello, Forrest.               Jenny walks over to Forrest and Lt. Dan.                          You got new legs. New legs!                          Yeah, I got new legs.               Lt. Dan lifts his pant leg to display his metal leg.                          Custom-made titanium alloy. It's                          what they use on the space shuttle.                          Magic legs.                          This is my fiancee, Susan.                          Lieutenant Dan!               Susan shakes Forrest's hand.                          Hi, Forrest.                          Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.                          Hey, it's nice to meet you, finally.               Jenny steps forward and kisses Lt. Dan's cheek. The group is                seated as they watch Forrest and Jenny take vows on the front                lawn. Forrest Jr. stands next to Jenny.                          Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be                          your wife? Do you, Jenny, take Forrest                          to be your husband? If so, I pronounce                          you man and wife.               The wind blows fallen leaves across the ground. Jenny,                Forrest, and Forrest Jr. walk toward the house. They all                hold hands as they walk.                Forrest steps into Jenny's bedroom. He carries a tray with                breakfast on it. Forrest looks at Jenny as she sleeps.               Slowly she wakes up and looks at Forrest.                          Hey.                          Hey.               Forrest sets the tray down next to Jenny as she sits up in                bed. Forrest opens a window, then sits down next to the bed.                          Hey, Forrest, were you scared in                          Vietnam?                          Yes. Well, I, I don't know.                Forrest looks up into the sky as the rain stops. Forrest                removes his helmet. The stars emerge from behind the clouds.                          Sometimes it would stop raining long                          enough for the stars to come out.                          And then it was nice. It was like                          just before the sun goes to bed down                          on the bayou...                Forrest stands on his boat and looks at a deep orange and                red sunset.                          There was over a million sparkles on                          the water. Like that mountain lake.                Forrest runs along a highway. A lake reflects the mountains                and the sky.                          It was so clear, Jenny. It looks                          like there were two skies, one on                          top of the other. And then in the                          desert, when the sun comes up...                Forrest runs along a desert highway. The morning light casts                an orange glow over the desert.                          I couldn't tell where heavens stopped                          and the earth began. It was so                          beautiful.                Forrest looks at Jenny. Jenny looks out the window.                          I wish I could have been there with                          you.                          You were.               Jenny reaches over and takes Forrest's hand.                          I love you.                          You died on a Saturday morning.                Forrest stands under the old oak tree where Jenny has been                buried.                          And I had you placed here under our                          tree.               Jenny's grave marker. Forrest tries to hold back his tears.                          And I had that house of your father's                          bulldozed to the ground.                Forrest watches as Jenny's dad's house is knocked down by a                bulldozer.                          Momma...                           ...always said dyin' was a part of                          life.               Jenny's grave marker reads: JENNY GUMP July 16, 1945 -- March                22, 1982 Beloved Mother, Wife and Friend                          I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest,                          he's doing just fine.                Forrest Jr. reads a book to Forrest sitting next to him.                               (reading)                         ""But he wasn't quite sure. Everywhere                          they went, the new guests...                          About to start school again soon. I                          make his breakfast, lunch, and                          dinner...                Forrest looks down as he sobs.                          ...every day. I make sure he combs                          his hair and brushes his teeth every                          day. Teaching him how to play ping                          pong.                Forrest tries to teach Forrest Jr. how to play ping-pong.                          Okay...                          He's really good.                          Forrest, you go.               Forrest Jr. serves the ball, causing Forrest dive and miss                it.                Forrest and Forrest Jr. sit on a log by the river and fish.                          We fish a lot.                Forrest looks down at the grave marker.                          And every night, we read a book.                         He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so                          proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a                          letter, and he says I can't read it.                          I'm not supposed to, so I'll just                          leave it here for you.               Forrest places the letter down at the grave marker, next to                fresh flowers. The name on the envelope reads: ""Mom."" Forrest                steps back and looks down at the grave.                          Jenny, I don't know if Momma was                          right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan.                         I don't know if we each have a                          destiny, or if we're all just floating                          around accidental-like on a breeze,                          but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe                          both is happening at the same time.                          I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything                          you need, I won't be far away.               As Forrest walks away, a flock of birds flies overhead and                lands in the tree. Forrest turns and watches.                Forrest walks with Forrest Jr. for the bus. The bus drives                toward them.                          Here's your bus. Okay.               Forrest pulls ""Curious George"" out of Forrest Jr.'s backpack.                          Hey, I know this.                          I'm gonna show that for show-and-                         tell because grandma used to read it                          to you.               Forrest looks at the book. The feather from the beginning of                the movie drops out of the book, unnoticed.                          My favorite book.               The bus comes to a stop. The door opens.                          Well...               Forrest puts the book back into Forrest Jr.'s backpack and                hands it to him.                          ...okay. Hey, there you go.               Forrest Jr. walks toward the bus. Forrest stands up.                          Hey, Forrest. Don't... I wanted to                          tell you I love you.                          I love you too, Daddy.                          I'll be right here when you get back.               Forrest Jr. looks into the bus and at the bus driver. It is                the same bus driver, only older now, who drove Forrest to                school when he was a young boy.                          You understand this is the bus to                          school now, don't you?                          Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris                          and I'm Forrest Gump.               Forrest Jr. looks over and waves to his father. Forrest nods                approvingly.               Forrest Jr. gets on the bus. The bus pulls away. Forrest                stands next to the mailbox.               Forrest sits down. The camera cranes down, revealing the                feather as it lies at Forrest's feet.               A gust of wind picks the feather up. The feather floats up                into the air.               Forrest sits at the side of the road. The feather floats                higher into the air.               The feather soars up into the sky and travels up and down,                then covers the camera lens.

(pulling Woody's string)            You saved the day again, Woody.             You're my favorite deputy. SONG ""YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME"" plays while Andy doesvarious activities with Woody:-- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cowsdrawn on the other side.  He grabs a jump rope and pretendsWoody is lassoing the cattle.             C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control)car, and herds the remaining ""cow"" boxes under Molly's crib. -- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banisterallowing the doll to slide downstairs.  Andy races ahead andcatches him at the bottom. -- Andy & Woody fall into the La-Z-Boy chair and spin aroundand around.Next, Andy uses the La-Z-Boy foot rest as a catapult.Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa.                    (raising his arms)            Score! Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking tohis mother.             Wow!  Cool!             Whadda ya think?             Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom! MRS. DAVIS, Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has justfinished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.  Abanner is draped across the archway.  It reads: ""HappyBirthday Andy.""Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthdaydecorations.             Can we leave this up 'til we move?             Well, sure, we can leave it up.             Yeah!             Now go get Molly.  Your friends are            going to be here any minute.             Okay.Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.             It's party time, Woody! Andy and Woody enter the room.  Molly is still bangingPotato Head against her crib railing.  Andy tips Woody's hatat her.             Howdy, Little Lady!He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one lasttime.             Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.                    (picking up Molly)            C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting            heavy!                   (to Woody)            See ya later, Woody.Andy exits. Woody's eyes come to life.  The cowboy doll sits up, hisexpression changing from a smile to worry.                    (to himself)            Pull my string!  The birthday            party's today?!Woody thinks.                    (to the room)            Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear.The bedroom comes alive.  TOYS emerge from the toy box, thecloset, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity.POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sitshimself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.             Ages three and up.  It's on my box.            Ages three and up!  I'm not            supposed to be babysitting Princess            Drool.HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coinslot.  Potato Head walks up to him.  All his facial piecesare in the wrong slots.             Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!             I don't get it.Hamm walks away.             You uncultured swine!                   (to someone O.S.)            What are you looking at, ya hockey            puck?!Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine.Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing onthe night stand.             Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?                    (saluting)            Sir!  No Sir!             Okay, thank you.  At ease.Woody hops off the bed.             Hey, Slinky?             Right here, Woody!A toy Slinky dog, SLINKY, appears from under the bed pushingout a checker board set.  He begins to place the checkers onthe board.             I'm red this time.             No, Slink --             Oh...well alright, you can be red            if you want.             Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad            news.             Bad news?!             Sh-h-h-h-h!!Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys inthe room are watching.  He leans in close to Slinky.                    (whispering)            Just gather everyone up for a staff            meeting and be happy!!             Got it.Slinky shuffles off.             Be HAPPY!Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.Woody proceeds in the other direction.  He passes a toyROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.                    (to the room)            Staff meeting, everybody.                   (aside)            Snake, Robot -- podium duty.Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantlyfollow Woody.Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the otherdirection.             Hey Etch!  Draw!Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketchetches a gun on its screen.                    (pretending to be shot)            Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've            been working on that draw.  Fastest            knobs in the west.Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.             Got a staff meeting, you guys, come            on, let's go!Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out ofLegos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor.             Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey,            who moved my doodle pad way over here?Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk andwalks over to it.  As he reaches down to pick it up...REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody.                     (unaffected)            Oh, how ya doin', Rex?Rex suddenly turns timid.             Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.             I was close to being scared that time.Woody heads back to the podium.  Rex follows.             I'm going for fearsome here, but I            just don't feel it.  I think I'm            just coming off as annoying.A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BOPEEP, the porcelain figurine.                    (choking)            Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.             I wanted to thank you, Woody, for            saving my flock.                    (blushing)            Oh, hey - it was nothing.             Whadda ya say I get someone else to            watch the sheep tonight?                    (very flustered)            Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack ofABC blocks.             Remember, I'm just a couple of            blocks away.Woody is left lovestruck.All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky.             Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up            front.Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.             Hey, Woody!  C'mon!Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium.The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium.MIKE, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody andindicates his microphone.             Ahem!                    (grabbing microphone)            Oh, thanks, Mike.                   (to the crowd)            Okay --                     (to Mike)            Oh, whoa, step back --Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.             Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great.            Everybody hear me?  Up on the            shelf, can you hear me?  Great!            Okay, first item today...oh, yeah.            Has everyone picked a moving buddy?The toys all MOAN.             Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!             Well I didn't know we were supposed            to have one already.                    (waving his arm out                   its socket)            Do we have to hold hands?The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.             Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a            big joke.  We've only got one week            left before the move.  I don't want            any toys left behind.  A moving            buddy -- if you don't have one, get            one!                   (checking the pad)            Alright, next...uh...oh, yes.            Tuesday night's ""Plastic Corrosion            Awareness"" meeting was, I think, a            big success and we want to thank Mr.            Spell for putting that on for us.            Thank you, Mr. Spell.The words ""You're welcome"" scroll across Mr. Spell's displayscreen as he speaks.             You're welcome.             Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note            here...                   (under his breath)            Andy's birthday party's been moved            to today.                   (full voice)            Next we have --The toys all PANIC.             What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's            today?!  His birthday's not 'til            next week!!             What's going on down there?  Is Mom            losing her marbles?!             Well, obviously she wanted to have            the party before the move.  I'm not            worried.  You shouldn't be worried.             Of course Woody ain't worried!            He's been Andy's favorite since            kindergarten!             Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head!            If Woody says it's all right, then,            well, darnit, it's good enough for            me.  Woody has never steered us            wrong before.While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth andmimes kissing his own butt.             C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and            birthday we go through this.             But what if Andy gets another            dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just            don't think I can take that kind of            rejection.             Hey, listen, no one's getting            replaced.  This is Andy we're            talking about.Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.                    (continued)            It doesn't matter how much we're            played with.  What matters is that            we're here for Andy when he needs            us.  That's what we're made for.            Right?Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.             Pardon me.  I hate to break up the            staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE!            Birthday guests at three o'clock!             Stay calm, everyone!!Too late.  The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towardsthe bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.             Uh, meeting adjourned.The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to geta peek outside.             Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at            all those presents?!             I can't see a thing!Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes outof his head and holds them up over the other toys. CHILDREN file towards the front door carrying presents.             Yessir, we're next month's garage            sale fodder for sure.                    (panicked)            Any dinosaur-shaped ones?             Ah, for crying out loud, they're            all in boxes, you idiot!The presents keep coming.             They're getting bigger.             Wait!  There's a nice little one            over there!At first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, butthen the kid turns -- the present is four feet long.  Thetoys SCREAM.             Spell the word ""trashcan.""             We're doomed!Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead insurrender.             Alright!  Alright!The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.                    (continued)            If I send out the troops, will you            all calm down?             Yes!  Yes!  We promise!             Okay, save your batteries!             Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using            the old noodle.Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent onthe nightstand.             Sargent.  Establish a recon post            downstairs.  Code red.  You know            what to do.             Yes SIR!The green army man hops down to the floor where a ""BUCKET O'SOLDIERS"" sits.             Alright men, you heard him.  Code            Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red!            Recon plan Charlie.  Execute!            Let's move move move!!THE GREEN ARMY MEN file out of the bucket and march information across the bedroom floor. Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forthto make sure the coast is clear.  Satisfied, he motions forthe others to proceed.  Squads of soldiers march into thehall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters andhold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scenebelow through his binoculars. Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallwayrounding up Andy and all his birthday guests.             Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the            living room.  It's almost time for            the presents.Once Mrs. Davis and the children are out of sight, theSargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.TWO PARATROOPERS jump out through the railing, parachutingdown to the floor below. The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles,then give the ""all clear"" sign.The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down. The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placedthe receiving half of the baby monitor.             And this --                   (turning on the baby monitor)            -- is how we find out what is in            those presents. The green army men march in formation across the floor whensuddenly... Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchendoor.  Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freezein their various classic action poses.             Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the            chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and            Barbeque --The door opens and Mrs. Davis' foot comes down hard on topof a soldier.             Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh,            I thought I told him to pick these up.With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out ofher path and continues on to the living room.              Shouldn't they be there by now?            What's taking them so long?!             Hey, these guys are professionals.            They're the best.  C'mon, they're            not lying down on the job. As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men toproceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into theliving room.The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling todrag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot.  TheSargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.                    (moans)            Go on without me.  Just go!             A good soldier never leaves a man            behind.The Sargent motions to the remaining men above.  They lowerthemselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.  Oncedownstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards thehouseplant.  Suddenly... bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footstepsand kid clamor.The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant,right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.  Theyconceal themselves in the house plant just before thechildren run by. While the baby monitor is set in place, A MEDIC evaluatesthe wounded soldier and gives the ""thumb's up"" signal.The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars. The pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living roomcoffee table.             There they are. The toys perk up as STATIC suddenly emits from the babymonitor.                    (over monitor)            Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha            Bravo.             This is it!  This is it!  Quiet,            quiet, quiet!                    (over monitor)            Come in, Mother Bird.            Alright...Andy's opening the first            present now.                    (chanting)            Mrs. Potato Head...Mrs. Potato            Head...Mrs. Potato Head...                   (off Rex's look)            Hey, I can dream, can't I?                    (over monitor)            The bow's coming off...he's ripping            the wrapping paper...it's            a...it's...it's a lunchbox!  We've            got a lunchbox, here!             A lunchbox?!             A lunchbox...?!             For lunch.  Heh heh heh...                    (over monitor)            Ok, second present...it appears to            be...okay, it's bed sheets.             Who invited THAT kid?!                 Oh, only one left.                     (over monitor)            Okay, we're on the last present now...             Last present!                    (over monitor)            It's a big one...It's a...it's a            boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship --            Battleship, the boardgame!The toys CHEER WITH RELIEF.             Yeah, alright!!Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back,sending his facial features flying.             Hey, watch it!             Sorry there, old Spudhead.                     (to army men)            Mission accomplished.  Well done,            men.  Pack it up, we're going home.              So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to            worry about.             I knew you were right all along,            Woody.  Never doubted you for a            second. The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when...             Wait a minute.  Oooh, what do we            have here?!The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes. Mrs. Davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling outanother large present.                    (indicating the baby monitor)            Wait -- turn that thing back on!                     (over monitor)            Come in, Mother Bird, come in,            Mother Bird.All the toys tense up.                    (continued)            Mom has pulled a surprise present            from the closet.  Andy's opening it...              He's really excited about this one.            It's a huge package.  Oh -- get            out -- one of the kids is in the            way, I can't see...                     (from monitor)            ...it's...it's a --The sound of children CHEERING emits from the monitor,cutting off the Sargent.             It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making themonitor drop to the floor.  The impact causes the batteriesto roll out.             Oh, no!             Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never            know what it is!                    (sarcastic)            Way to go, Rex.Everyone rushes to the fallen monitor.  Potato Head tries tocorrectly insert the batteries.             No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em            around!             Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!             Plus is positive, minus is negative!            Oh, let me!Woody jumps down off the bed and shoves both Hamm and PotatoHead aside.              Let's go to my room, guys!The kids rush past the houseplant.                    (into the monitor)  Woody puts the last battery back in.             There.                    (over monitor)            Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat!            Resume your positions NOW!             Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to            your places.  Hurry!The toys PANIC and scatter about the room.             Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear?            Did you see my ear?             Outta my way!  Here I come, here I            come --Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over.Everyone scurries to their places as the KIDS' FOOTSTEPSgrow louder.Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as...Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children'sfeet rush in.             Hey, look!  His lasers light up.             Take that, Zurg!Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, downthe gap between the bed and the back wall.             Quick!  Make a space!  This is            where the spaceship lands.             -- and you press his back and he            does a karate-chop action!             Come on down, guys.  It's time for            games!  We've got prizes!             Oh, yeah!The kids all run out as fast as they entered, SLAMMING THEDOOR behind them. The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.             What is it?             Can you see it?             What the heck is up there?             Woody?  Who's up there with you?Woody crawls out from under the bed.  The toys are shockedto discover him there.             Woody, what are you doing under the            bed?                    (composing himself)            Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing.            I'm sure Andy was just a little            excited, that's all.  Too much cake            and ice cream, I suppose.  It's            just a mistake.             Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in            your spot, Woody.             Have you been replaced?             Hey!  What did I tell you earlier?            No one is getting replaced.The toys give each other a look of doubt.             Now let's all be polite, and give            whatever it is up there a nice, big            ""Andy's Room"" welcome.Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over theedge.  His eyes widen at the sight of... We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space ageaction figure, covered with buttons and stickers from headto toe.  The imposing ""G.I. Joe-sized"" doll stands heroicallyin the center of the bed, his back to Woody.Woody GULPS.Buzz comes alive and looks around. While he scans the bedroom a ""DARTH VADER"" LIKE BREATHING isheard.Buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest.              Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.            Come in, Star Command.Nothing.  He pushes the button again.             Star Command - come in.  Do you            read me?                   (to himself)            Why don't they answer?!!Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging.  Thebox is designed to look like a spaceship.             My ship!!He runs up to the box and investigates the damage.             Blast!  This'll take weeks to repair!Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- hiswrist communicator.             Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.            Stardate 4072: My ship has run off            course en route to sector 12.  I've            crash landed on a strange planet.            The impact must have awoken me from            hyper-sleep.Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed.                    (into communicator)            Terrain seems a bit unstable...He taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator.                    (into communicator)            No read-out yet if the air is            breathable... and there seems to be            no sign of intelligent life            anywhere -- Woody's face suddenly pops into view.             Hello-o-o... Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance.  He presses abutton on his arm that turns on a red ""laser beam"" light onhis wrist.  Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead andholds it there.             Aaaaaaah!  Whoa, hey, whoa, did I            frighten you?  Didn't mean to.            Sorry.  Howdy!  My name is Woody            and this is Andy's room.  That's            all I wanted to say, and also,            there has been a bit of a mix-up.            This is my spot, see, the bed here --While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge onWoody's vest.                    (de-activating his                   laser beam)            Local law enforcement!  It's about            time you got here.  I'm Buzz            Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe            Protection Unit.  My ship has crash            landed here by mistake.Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation.Woody tries to keep up.             Yes, it is a mistake, because, you            see, the bed, here, is my spot.             I need to repair my turbo boosters.            Do you people still use fossil            fuels, or have you discovered            crystalic fusion?             Well, let's see, we've got double            A's --             Watch yourself!!Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wristlaser.                    (continued)            Halt!  Who goes there?!The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed.             Don't shoot!  It's okay!  Friends!                    (to Woody)            Do you know these life forms?             Yes.  They're Andy's toys.             Alright, everyone.  You're clear to            come up.Buzz walks over to the toys.             I am Buzz Lightyear.  I come in peace.Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand.             Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!             Why, thank you...                   (pulls away)            Now thank you all for your kind            welcome.             Say!  What's that button do?             I'll show you.Buzz presses a button on his chest.             Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!The toys all GASP IN AWE.             Hey, Woody's got something like            that.  His is a pullstring, only            it --             Only it sounds like a car ran over it.             Oh yeah, but not like this one.            This is a quality sound system.            Probably all copper wiring, huh?            So, uh, where are you from?            Singapore?  Hong Kong?             Well...no, actually I'm stationed            up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector            4.  As a member of the elite            Universe Protection Unit of the            Space Ranger Corps, I protect the            galaxy from the threat of invasion            from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn            enemy of the Galactic Alliance.As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzzarrived. There is a cartoon drawing of Buzz giving the exact, word-for-word spiel that Buzz is now giving.             Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.             And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not            actually  from Mattel, I'm actually            from a smaller company that was            purchased in a leveraged buy-out.            Well, I don't really understand the            financials, but...Woody walks over to Bo Peep.             You'd think they've never seen a            new toy before.             Well sure, look at him.  He's got            more gadgets on him then a Swiss            army knife.Slinky presses the button on Buzz's arm, activating hislaser light.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.             Ah, ah, ah, please be careful!  You            don't want to be in the way when my            laser goes off.             Hey, a laser!  How come you don't            have a laser, Woody?             It's not a laser!  It's a little            lightbulb that blinks!             What's with him?             Laser-envy.             All right, that's enough.  Look,            we're all very impressed with            Andy's new toy --             Toy?             T-O-Y.  Toy.             Excuse me, I think the word you're            searching for is Space Ranger.             The word I'm searching for I can't            say because there's pre-school toys            present.             Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?             Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm            curious.  What does a Space Ranger            actually do?             He's not a Space Ranger!  He            doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers            or fly --             Excuse me.Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out.Again the toys GASP IN AWE.             Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!             Oh, what?!...What?!  These are            plastic.  He can't fly!             They are a terillium-carbonic alloy            and I CAN fly.             No, you can't.             Yes, I can.             You can't!             Can!             Can't!  Can't!  Can't!             I tell you, I could fly around this            room with my eyes closed!             Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.             All right, then, I will.                   (to toys)            Stand back everyone!The crowd of toys make room for Buzz as he heads towards theedge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost.  He poses like ahigh diver, shuts his eyes...             To infinity and beyond!!...and leaps off the bed.Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball andbounces right back up.He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down thetrack, through the loop, and off a ramp.  Buzz soars upwardinto a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling.Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels.  The impactturns on the PLANE'S MOTOR making it (and Buzz) spin aroundand around.All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized.Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate fromthe plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed.Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody andthen opens his eyes.             Can.The crowd of toys rush Buzz, CHEERING AND CLAPPING WITH              Whoa!  Oh, wow!  You flew            magnificently!             I found my moving buddy!             Why, thank you.  Thank you all.            Thank you.             That wasn't flying!  That was            falling with style!             Man, the dolls must really go for            you!                   (aside)            Can you teach me that?Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming.Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody.             Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --             Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days,            everything will be just the way it            was.  They'll see... they'll see.            I'm still Andy's favorite toy. SONG: STRANGE THINGS plays over montage. A) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed,running around the room.B) Andy sets Woody down on the floor.  Next he ""lands"" BuzzLightyear on the floor opposite Woody.  Andy shoots Buzz'slaser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as ifhe'd been blown away by the laser.C) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat andcowboy pajamas. Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamasand a homemade spaceman's helmet.             Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.D) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroomtransform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on thewall, the pillow, the bedspread.E) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR.  The space rangersuggests a few tips for the dinosaur.  Rex tries again, thistime giving a ""JURASSIC PARK"" ROAR.The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.F) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait ofBuzz.Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll'shair, chatting away like a hair dresser.Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoysas weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,using his feet as a treadmill.Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but endsup tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to thebarbell.H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only thecheckerboard.Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky andRobot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's ""ship"" up ontop of ABC blocks for repair.In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending thepieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off thedresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end isstretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slinky'swagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving hisfront end no choice but to eventually follow.J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox untiljust Woody and Buzz are left.  He deliberates as to whichtoy to keep and which to toss into the toybox. Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers nextto him.Woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinksback into the box, closing the lid to...  The black screen splits horizontally to become... All is clear -- no sign of Andy.  Woody throws open the lidof the toy box.             Finally!He takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discoversthat his hat is missing.                    (looking back into                   the toy box)            Hey!  Who's got my hat?The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat.             Look, I'm Woody.  Howdy, howdy, howdy!                    (sarcastic)            Ah-hah!  Ah-hah-hah!                   (grabs the hat)            Give me that!Woody leaps out of the toy box.             Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog.            Let me show you something.  It            looks as though I've been accepted            into your culture.Woody looks up to see Buzz chatting with Rex and Slinky.                    (continued)            Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his            name on me.Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see thesole of his boot.The name ""ANDY"" is written on it in permanent marker.             Wow!             With permanent ink, too!             Well, I must get back to repairing            my ship.Buzz walks away.Woody looks at HIS foot -- ""Andy"" is written on it also butin a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded.             Don't let it get to you, Woody.Hearing Bo, Woody puts his foot back down and quicklystraightens up.                    (nonchalant)            Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what            do you mean?  Who?             I know Andy's excited about Buzz,            but you know, he'll always have a            special place for you.                    (walking past)            Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...             Alright!  That's it!Woody angrily marches across the room.Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on theABC blocks.  Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides underthe ship like a mechanic.  Snake and Robot stand by waitingfor instructions.  Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.             Unidirectional bonding strip.Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tapedispenser.             Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!Snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth.Woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's footand rolls him out from under the ship.             Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away            from Andy.  He's mine, and no one            is taking him away from me.             What are you talking about?                   (to Robot)            Where's that bonding strip?!Buzz rolls himself back under.  Woody rolls him out again.             And another thing.  Stop with this            spaceman thing.  It's getting on my            nerves.             Are you saying you want to lodge a            complaint with Star Command?             Oh okay, so you want to do it the            hard way, huh?Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody.             Don't even think about it, cowboy!             Oh, yeah, tough guy?!Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating abutton that makes the spaceman's helmet open.Buzz grabs his neck, GASPING FOR AIR.  He drops to his kneesand begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath.Woody is unsure how to react.Suddenly, Buzz SNIFFS the air.             The air isn't toxic.Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody.             How dare you open a spaceman's            helmet on an uncharted planet!  My            eyeballs could've been sucked from            their sockets!Buzz closes his helmet.             You actually think you're THE ""Buzz            Lightyear?"" Oh, all this time I            thought it was an act!                   (to the room)            Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL            Buzz Lightyear!             You're mocking me, aren't you?             Oh, no, no, no...                   (pointing behind Buzz)            Buzz, look!  An alien!             Where?Buzz falls for the trick and turns around.Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER. Woody stops short.  All the toys look to the bedroom window.             Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...             Uh-oh.Slinky hides under the bed.             It's Sid!             I thought he was at summer camp!             They must have kicked him out early            this year.The toys rush over to the window.             Oh, no!  Not Sid!             ...Incoming!From out the window, SID PHILLIPS, a hyperactive ten-year-old, and his dog, SCUD, can be roughly made out jumpingaround in their backyard.A tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard.Sid pummels the figure with rocks while Scud strains at hisleash, barking wildly.             Who is it this time?             I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?             Right here, Woody.Woody turns to see, LENNY, a pair of wind-up binoculars,approaching him from the other end of the desk.  Woody picksLenny up and looks through him to survey the scene.             Oh, no.  I can't bear to watch one            of these again! A full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in thecenter of the backyard.  A huge M-80 is strapped to thedoll's back with masking tape.             Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.                    (plays under the next                   5 lines)            Just stay where you are, Corporal!            Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up.            I know you're tired!  I know your            leg is cramping, but you can't move.            Do you hear me?Buzz breaks through the crowd.             What's going on?             Nothing that concerns you spacemen.            Just us TOYS.             I'd better take a look anyway.Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him.             Why is that soldier strapped to an            explosive device?                    (redirecting Buzz's view)            That's why.  Sid.              Sure is a hairy fellah.             No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view. He is sporting a skull t-shirt and LAUGHING HIDEOUSLY.             THAT is Sid!             You mean that happy child?             That ain't no happy child.             He tortures toys -- just for fun.             Well, then we've got to do something!Buzz steps up onto the window ledge.  The toys GASP IN SHOCK.             What are you doing?!!  Get down            from there!             I'm going to go teach that boy a            lesson.             Yeah, sure.  You go ahead.  Melt            him with your scary laser.Woody presses Buzz's laser button.  It emits a WIMPYELECTRONIC BEEP.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.             Be careful with that, it's            extremely dangerous.While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lightingthe fuse of the M80.             He's lighting it!  He's lighting it!              Hit the dirt!The toys jump away from the window. Dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side ofAndy's house.             Yes!  He's gone!  He's history!Andy's toys peek over the window sill. A large black scorch mark is all that remains where CombatCarl once stood.  Sid jumps up and down victoriously whileScud resumes his BARKING.             I could have stopped him.             Buzz, I would love to see you try.                   (gesturing to Sid's yard)            'Course I'd love to see you as a            crater.Sid CACKLES and dances around the crater.             The sooner we move the better.  A ""FOR SALE"" real estate sign stands in the front yard.Another sign reading ""SOLD"" hangs from the bottom. Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in.  The room isfull of packing boxes, most of them half full.  Andy isplaying with Woody and Buzz.             To infinity and beyond!             Oh, all this packing makes me            hungry.  What would you say to            dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?             Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing righton top of Woody.             Go wash your hands and I'll get            Molly ready.The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shovesBuzz off of him.             Can I bring some toys?             You can bring ONE toy...             Just one?Woody perks up with concern.                    (to himself)            One toy?He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking awaytowards the opposite end of the desk.Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk.With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball.                    (whispering)            Will Andy pick me?He tips the 8 ball over.  The triangular oracle floats up tothe surface.  Its prediction reads: DON'T COUNT ON IT.             Don't count on it?!!  Doh-h-h-h!Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust.  It rolls acrossthe desk and falls behind it with a LOUD THUD.Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the deskand peers down it. The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom.  The space isa black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit...a toy.Woody looks across the desk at Buzz.He is HUMMING TO HIMSELF as he forages through Andy'spen/pencil tray looking for ""tools"" to repair his ship with.Right behind Buzz sits It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side.Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz.             Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!!            Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!            We've got trouble!             Trouble?!                   (looking around)            Where?!                    (pointing to the back                   of the desk)            Down there.  Just down there.  A            helpless toy...it's...it's trapped,            Buzz!             Then we've no time to lose!!Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.             I don't see anything!Woody picks up the remote for the RC Car and switches it on.RC's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.             Oh, he's there.  Just, just keep            looking.Woody hits the ""FORWARD"" button on the remote and steers theRC Car straight for Buzz.             What kind of a toy -- ?Buzz turns to see RC headed straight for him.  He dives outof the way as the RC Car SMASHES into the base of... The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board.  Buzzducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desklike arrows. sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm.He looks up at the desk and GASPS as the bulletin boardslams down onto... knocking it out of its stand.  The globe starts rollingright at Buzz.Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created.Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behindhim, Indiana Jones style.  Buzz gets stuck ""log rolling"" ona pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of theway onto the window ledge.The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-styledesklamp.  The arm of the lamp swings all the way around,barely missing Woody......and knocks Buzz out the window.              Buzz!!!Woody looks out the window.  No sign of Buzz.  All the othertoys rush over to the sill.             I don't see him in the driveway!  I            think he bounced into Sid's yard.Woody backs away from the COMMOTION, unnoticed.             Buzz!                    (electric motor sounds)            Whirrr!!  Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!Rex looks over at RC.  The remote control car is bouncing upand down excitedly.             Hey everyone!  RC's trying to say            something!The toys turn from the window to RC.                    (leaning down close                   to RC)            What is it, boy?                    (electric motor sounds)            Whirrr!!! Whirrr!  Whirrrrrr!!             He's sayin' that this was no accident.             Huh?             What do you mean?             I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed...                   (pointing at Woody)            ...by Woody. The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks.             Wait a minute.  You -- you don't            think I meant to knock Buzz out the            window, do you Potato Head?             That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you            back-stabbin' murderer!             Now, it was an accident!  Guys,            c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me             We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?                    (backing away)            Oh, I don't like confrontations.The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody.             Where is your honor, dirtbag?!  You            are an absolute disgrace!  You            don't deserve to --Woody seals the lid back on the bucket.Potato Head starts closing in on Woody.             Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on            your playtime, could ya Woody?            Didn't want to face the fact that            Buzz just might be Andy's new            favorite toy, so you got rid of him.            Well, what if Andy starts playin'            with me more, Woody, huh?  You            gonna knock me outta the window, too?Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of thedesk -- trapped.             I don't think we should give him            the chance.Suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men.             There he is, men!  Frag him!The army men yell CHARGE and pounce on Woody, while all therest of the toys close in.             Let's string him up by his pull-            string!             I got dibs on his hat!             Would you boys stop it?!             Tackle him!             No, no, no, no!  Wait!  Wait I can            explain everything --             Andy, c'mon!             Okay, Mom, be right down.  I've got            to get Buzz.             Retreat!The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places.Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk whereWoody is lying.  Andy overlooks Woody and begins searchingaround the room.             Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?             No, I haven't seen him.Woody painfully watches as Andy searches in vain for Buzz.             Psssst!Woody looks across the room.Potato Head and Etch-A-Sketch peek out of a packing box.Etch-A-Sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while Potato Headpoints an accusing finger in Woody's direction.Woody GULPS.             Andy!  I'm heading out the door.             But Mom, I can't find him!             Well, honey, just grab some other            toy!  Now c'mon!             Okay...He grabs Woody and walks out of the room. Andy exits the house dragging Woody as he heads toward thefamily van in the driveway.             I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I            left him right there.             Honey, I'm sure he's around.            You'll find him. next to the van begins to rustle.  Hands part the foliage,revealing Buzz.  He eyes Woody going into the van and does aslow burn.The van ENGINE STARTS UP.  Buzz races out of the bush, andwith a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as itpulls out of the driveway. A chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerabledistance above the ground. The rest of Andy's toys have regrouped at the window,supervising the lowering of the ""monkey chain.""             It's too short!  We need more monkeys!                    (holding up an empty barrel)            There aren't any more!  That's the            whole barrel.Rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge.                    (yelling out window)            Buzz!  The monkeys aren't working!            We're formulating another plan!            Stay calm!                   (beat)            Oh, where could he be? The Davis' family van pulls up to one of the pumps. Andy sits in the rear seat with Woody lying next to him.             Can I help pump the gas?             Sure!  I'll even let you drive.Both Mrs. Davis and Andy exit the van while baby Mollysleeps up front in her car seat.             Yeah?!             Yeah -- when you're sixteen.                    (sarcastic)            Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.With Mom and Andy out of range, Woody comes to life.  Hestares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything.             Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince            those guys it was an accident?Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof.             Buzz!Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody.  He is furious.             Buzz!  You're alive!  This is great!            Oh, I'm saved!  I'm saved!  Andy'll            find you here, he'll take us back            to the room, and then you can tell            everyone that this was all just a            big mistake.  Huh?No response from Buzz.  Just an angry stare.                    (weakly)            Right?  Buddy?             I just want you to know that even            though you tried to terminate me,            revenge is not an idea we promote            on my planet.             Oh.  Oh, that's good.                    (getting in Woody's face)            But we're not on my planet, are we?             No.Buzz lunges for Woody.  The two toys fly off the seat andout the open side door of the van. Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, lockedin mortal combat.             Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of            me?!Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around.Woody lunges with all his might.  He smacks Buzz in theface, making it SQUEAK with every blow.Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand.             Owwwww!!!Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activatingBUZZ'S SAMPLED VOICE buttons. The toys stop fighting.  Before they can react...             Next stop...             Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!The van drives off.             Andy?!Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but itdrives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded.             Doesn't he realize that I'm not            there?                   (beat)            I'm LOST!  Oh, I'm a lost toy!Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings.  He flips open hiswrist communicator.             Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.  The            local Sheriff and I seem to be at a            huge refueling station of some            sort --Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic toseething anger.  He charges at Buzz.             You! Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of abehemoth tanker truck pulling into the station.Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right wherehe stands on the pavement.  The truck ROARS over him. stops just millimeters from Woody's nose.Petrified, Woody inches away from the tire, moving backunder the truck until he bumps into Buzz.                    (into wrist communicator)            According to my nava-computer, the --                    (whispering)            Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!             Sheriff, this is no time to panic.             This is the perfect time to panic!            I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're            going to move from their house in            two days and it's all your fault!!             My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me            out of the window in the first            place --             Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't            shown up in your stupid little            cardboard spaceship and taken away            everything that was important to            me --             Don't talk to me about importance.            Because of YOU the security of this            entire universe is in jeopardy.                    (incredulous)            WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!Buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to thestars.             Right now, poised at the edge of            the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been            secretly building a weapon with the            destructive capacity to annihilate            an entire planet.  I alone have            information that reveals this            weapon's only weakness.                   (pointing at Woody)            And you, my friend, are responsible            for delaying my rendez-vous with            Star Command.Woody explodes.             YOU ARE A TOY!!!  You aren't the            real Buzz Lightyear, you're an            action figure!!  You are a child's            plaything!!!Beat.             You are a sad strange little man            and you have my pity.  Farewell.Buzz walks off.             Oh, yeah?  Well, good riddance, ya            looney!Woody walks away in the opposite direction.                    (to himself)            Rendez-vous with Star Command.              Hey, Gas Dude!             You talkin' to me?             Yeah, man, can you help me?  Do you            know where Cutting Blvd. is?             Just a moment...Woody looks in the direction of the bell.  His face lightsup at the sight of...                     (to himself)            Pizza Planet...Andy!Woody takes a step forward and then stops.             Oh, no!  I can't show my face in            that room without Buzz.Woody runs back under the tanker truck.  Buzz is at the farend of the truck, walking away from Woody.             Buzz!  Buzz, come back!                    (continuing to walk away)            Go away.Woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation andthen eyes... Atop the truck is a rocket with the Pizza Planet logo.             No, Buzz, you've gotta come back.            I found a spaceship!Buzz stops walking away and looks back at Woody.             It's a spaceship, Buzz! The delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off.             C'mon, man, hurry up.  Um, like the            pizza's are getting cold here.Woody and Buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within thesafety of a nearby oilcan display.             Now you're sure this spacefreighter            will return to its port of origin            once it jettisons its food supply?             Uh-huh.  And when we get there,            we'll be able to find a way to            transport you...home.             Well, then let's climb abroad.Buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of thepizza truck.  Woody chases after him.             No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's            get in the back.  No one will see            us there.             Negative.  There are no restraining            harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll            be much safer in the cockpit.In a flash, Buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rearview mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab.                    (loud whisper)            Yeah, but, Buzz!  Buzz!             Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a            right, huh?             Yeah.             Okay, thanks for the directions.                    (loud whisper)            Buzz! Woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up thebumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside.Woody lets out a YELL, as the back hatch slams back down onhis rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck. Woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab.Buzz is hidden from THE PIZZA DRIVER's view by a stack ofpizzas in their insulated covers.  Buzz prudently fastenshis safety belt.             It'll be safer in the cockpit than            the cargo bay.  What an idiot!The driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propellingWoody to the back of the truck.The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turnsand hills at high speeds.  Woody is helplessly thrown aroundthe truck.  With every blow, Woody YELPS in pain.The truck climbs a steep hill.  Woody looks up just in timeto see... barreling towards him.   We MOVE DOWN to reveal... The delivery truck barrels into the parking lot and parks. After the driver leaves the truck, Buzz peeks out from thepassenger window. Two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway.  AsCUSTOMERS approach the front, the guards part their crossed""pizza spears,"" allowing the patrons to enter.             You are clear to enter.  Welcome to            Pizza Planet.VARIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS blare out from speakers:             Next shuttle lift-off scheduled for            T-minus 30 minutes and counting...             The white zone is for eating pizza            only.  The white zone is for...Excited, Buzz pries open the window between the cab andtruck bed.             Sheriff!Woody is gone.  Just the toolbox and strewn trash.                    (continued)            Sheriff?The toolbox falls on its side revealing Woody.  He peels offthe back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash.             There you are.  Now the entrance is            heavily guarded.  We need a way to            get inside.Woody rises from the trash with a ""MEGA-GULP"" cup on his head.             Great idea, Woody!  I like your            thinking! In the f.g. sits a trashcan with fast food containerslittered around it.  MORE CUSTOMERS approach the ""guarded""entrance.             You are clear to enter.  Welcome to            Pizza Planet.The front doors automatically swing open as the people passthrough.  Suddenly two pieces of trash -- a burger containerand ""MEGA-GULP"" cup stand up.                    (in burger container) The two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors.                    (in container)            Quickly, Sheriff!  The airlock is            closing. Woody and Buzz just make it inside but then freezeimmediately as a GROUP OF KIDS run past, forcing the toys topose as discarded trash.Once the coast is clear, Woody and Buzz resume walking.Buzz bumps into Woody.                    (using straw as periscope)            Ow!  Watch where you're going!                    (mouthing with burger box)            Sorry.They sneak in between two long rows of video games and throwoff their disguises.  They then take a good look at... The space-themed arena is filled with hordes of childrenplaying video games.  A sea of HI-TECH SOUNDS and lightsoverwhelm the place.Buzz is beaming with hope.             What a space port.  Good work, Woody.Woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, butnone of the kids look familiar to him.  Just then he HEARS...             Mom, can I play Black Hole?            Please, please, please?!Woody turns around and through the video games he spots... standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller.                    (to himself)            Andy!             What's Black Hole?             Oh, it's so cool...The family begins to walk away.             Now we need to find a ship that's            headed for Sector 12 --Buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction whenWoody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor.             Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way!            There's a special ship.  I just saw            it!             You mean it has hyperdrive?             Hyper-active hyperdrive, and            astro...uh, turf.The toys manage to get ahead of Andy.  Woody peeks aroundthe corner of one of the video games and waits for Mom andAndy to approach.                    (tracking Andy and family)            C'mon, c'mon, that's it...             Where is it?  I don't see the --Buzz stops short at the sight of... It is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch.                    (continued)            Spaceship.             Alright Buzz, get ready...Buzz heads for the crane game, but Woody does not notice,his eyes locked on the approaching stroller.             Okay, Buzz, when I say ""go,"" we're            gonna jump in the basket --Woody turns and realizes Buzz is gone.  He looks across theway just in time to see Buzz leap into the crane gamethrough the ""PRIZE"" slot.                    (loud whisper)            Buzz!Woody turns back in the direction of the stroller.It has already gone past.             Dooh!  No!  This cannot be            happening to me!!Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to holdback for a moment as some SCREAMING children pass by. Buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slotfrom the prize toys and leaps into a pile of... There are hundreds of them, all identical and way too cute.                    (excited)            A stranger!             From the outside!             Oo-o-o-o-o-o...             Greetings!  I am Buzz Lightyear!  I            come in peace!             Tell us!  What is it like outside?The squeeze toys rush Buzz like JABBERING excited children. With the kids gone, Woody crosses the aisle to the cranegame and dives through the prize slot. Woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot.             This is an intergalactic emergency!            I need to commandeer your vessel to            Sector 12!Woody peeks over the partition to witness Buzz surround bythe cute alien toys.                    (continued; to the aliens)            Who's in charge here?All the aliens point upward.             The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!Woody and Buzz look up. It dangles directly above the toys.             The claw is our master.             The claw chooses who will go and            who will stay.                    (to himself)            This is ludicrous.                    (laughter)Woody GASPS at the recognition of Sid's voice.  He turns tosee Sid heading straight for the crane game.             Oh, no!  Sid!!!Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing thetwo of them deep into the pile of aliens.             Get down!!Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of hispants pocket.                    (loud whisper)            What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I            was --                    (loud whisper)            YOU are the one that decided to            climb into this --                    (loud whisper)            Sh-h-h-h-h-h.  The claw.  It moves. It moves into position and hovers directly above the areawhere Woody and Buzz are hiding.The crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that isright on top of Buzz.                    (whispering excitedly)            I have been chosen!!Positioned with his back to Sid, the alien is lifted up bythe claw.                    (continued)            Farewell, my friends!  I go on to a            better place.             Gotcha!With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed,forcing the space ranger to freeze.  Sid suddenly spots Buzz.             A Buzz Lightyear!  No way!Woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some wayto escape.  Behind him, through the aliens, he eyes... Woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door.He grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a fewattempts, is able to pry the door open.The shadow of the crane lines up over Buzz, lowers, andgrabs his head.             Yes!The claw begins to lift Buzz up.             Buzz, NO!Woody grabs hold of Buzz's feet.Woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with Buzz.Woody pulls down hard, forcing Buzz to sink into the pile ofaliens, out of Sid's view.                    (slamming his fist                   against the glass)            Wha -- ?  Hey!!Still tugging against the crane, Woody is almost out thedoor with Buzz.  Just then, the aliens at the bottom of thepile pull Buzz and Woody back inside.             He has been chosen.             Hey!  What are you doing?             He must go.             Stop it, you -- !  Stop it, you            zealots!             He must go!  Do not fight the claw!            Do not anger the claw!  He has been            chosen.Woody and Buzz are pushed up to the surface and into theair, dangling lifelessly in front of Sid.             Alright!  Double prizes!Woody and Buzz are dropped into the prize door slot andsnatched up by Sid.                    (looking at his two                   new toys)            Let's go home and...play.  Ha-ha-ha.   From out of the darkness appears Sid on his skateboard.  Heis HUMMING to rock music from his walkman while carrying hisbackpack in his hand.Sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front pathtowards the front door.Through the open zipper, Buzz peeks out of the backpack tosee Sid's house.  He recognizes Andy's house next door. Buzz, Woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in thebackpack.             Sheriff!  I can see your dwelling            from here!  You're almost home.             Nirvana is coming!  The mystic            portal awaits!                    (to Alien)            Will you be quiet?!!                   (to both)            You guys don't get it, do you?            Once we go into Sid's house, we            won't be coming out. The front door opens to reveal Scud.  The dog lungesstraight for the backpack, BARKING.             Whoa, Scud!  Hey, boy.  Sit!  Good            boy!The dog begrudgingly obeys.             Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy.Sid's hand reaches into the backpack.                    (loud whisper) The toys go still.  Sid's hand grabs the alien out of thebackpack.  The alien is then placed sideways along Scud'ssnout.             Ready, set, NOW.In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it inhis mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth.Buzz and Woody react in horror.             Hannah!  Hey, Hannah!!!Woody and Buzz glance up to see HANNAH, Sid's frail littlesister, carrying her Janie Doll.             What?             Did I get my package in the mail?             I dunno.             Whaddaya mean, you don't know?                    (insistent)            I don't know!                    (mock concern)            Oh no, Hannah!             What?             Look!  Janie!He grabs the doll.             Hey!!             She's sick!                    (panic rising)            No she's NOT --             I'll have to perform one of            my...operations!             NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!Sid bolts upstairs with Hannah in pursuit.             Not Sid's room...not there... Sid races to his bedroom door.  Hannah is right behind.             Sid!  Give her back!Sid just LAUGHS.  He charges into the room and slams thedoor in his sister's face.                     (pounding on his door)            Sid!  Sid!...Sid carelessly tosses the backpack on the bed and walks overto a makeshift workbench.                    (as Doctor)            Oh, no.  We have a sick patient            here, nurse.  Prepare the O.R., STAT!Sid CLICKS on a bare bulb dangling above his ""operatingtable.""Woody and Buzz look on from the safety of the backpack asSid places the Janie doll's head in a vise.             Sid, give her back!  Give her back            now!  I'm telling!                    (as Doctor)            Patient is...                   (straining while                   tightening vise)            ...pre-e-epped.Sid grabs a painter's mask from his toolchest and dons itlike a surgeon's mask.                    (as Doctor)            No one's ever attempted a double            bypass brain transplant before.Sid grabs a toy pterodactyl from a nearby crate full of junk.                    (as Doctor)            Now for the tricky part -- pliers!                    (whispering to Woody)            I don't believe that man's ever            been to medical school.Sid struggles for a moment with his ""patient"" then stops.                    (as Nurse)            Doctor, you've done it!                   (running to the door)            Hannah?He opens the door.  Hannah is standing there, looking worried.                    (continued)            Janie's all better now.He hands her Janie -- her head has been replaced with apterodactyl's.  Hannah SCREAMS at the sight of themonstrosity and bolts down the hallway.              She's lying!  Whatever she says            it's not true!Sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after Hannah,slamming the door behind him.Woody and Buzz peer out of the backpack at their newsurroundings.  Heavy metal posters, discarded toy remainsand power tools adorn the messy room.They are in Hell...toy Hell.             We are gonna die.                   (bolting out of the pack)            I'm outta here!Woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles toopen it.  No good.  Woody drops to the floor.             Locked!  There's gotta be another            way out of here. Woody is startled by the noise.A small yo-yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on itsside.Spooked, Woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishesit like a weapon.Just then a shadow passes by Woody.  He turns quickly butsees nothing.             Uh...Buzz?  Was that you?Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight.He hears a NOISE from under Sid's bed.  Woody turns on theflashlight and shines the beam in the direction of thenoise, illuminating...              Hey!  Hi, there, little fellah!            Come out here.  Do you know a way            out of here?The baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one-eyed doll head atop a spider-like body made of erector setpieces. The creature extends its legs and rises up taller than Woody.Scared speechless, Woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on Various other MUTANT TOYS begin to emerge from the shadows:a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard witha combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack-in-the-box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others).Woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind Buzz.             B-B-B-Buzz!Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war asthey grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging themoff into the shadows.             They're cannibals!Woody retreats back into the backpack. Woody cowers in the corner as Buzz enters.  He punches abutton on his chest.             May day!  May day!  Come in, Star            Command!  Send reinforcements!...                   (pause)            Star Command, do you copy?No response.Buzz adjusts his laser light.  It emits a short BLIP.                    (aiming his arm out                   the pack)            I've set my laser from stun to kill.             Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if            anyone attacks us we can blink 'em            to death. Rex points a flashlight out of Andy's bedroom window whileBo Peep, Slinky, Hamm and Potato Head look on.Some bushes rustle below.             Hey, you guys!  I think I've found            him.  Buzz!  Is that you?!Rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes.  Theannoyed MEOW of a cat is heard.             Whiskers!  Will you get out of            here?!  You're interfering with the            search and rescue. Rex turns off the flashlight.                    (whispering)            Look!  They're home!The toys duck behind the sill.The Davis' family van pulls into the driveway.  Andy and Mrs.Davis get out.             Mom, have you seen Woody?             Where was the last place you left him?                    (searching the van)            Right here in the van.             Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're            just not looking hard enough.             He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.The toys all look at one another.             Woody's gone?!             Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran            away.Hamm, Potato Head and Rex walk away from the window.             Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was            guilty.             Who would've thought he was capable            of such atrocities?!Bo Peep and Slinky are left alone at the window, visiblycrestfallen.             Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.                      (as Interrogator)            Oh, a survivor.  Where is the rebel            base?  Talk!  An inanimate Woody flies across the room, landing hard onthe floor.Sid crosses to the window.                    (as Interrogator)            I can see your will is strong.Sid opens the window shade.  Bright sunlight shines downonto Woody.                    (continued)            Well, we have ways of making you talk.Sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket andfocuses the beam on Woody's forehead.                    (as Interrogator)            Where are your rebel friends now?            Heh, heh.A bright white hot dot forms on Woody's forehead and beginsto smolder.             Sid!!  Your pop-tarts are ready!Sid pulls the magnifying glass away.             Alright!!Sid runs out of the room.  As soon as he's gone, Woody jumpsup SCREAMING, his forehead burning.He runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal (with milk) on thefloor, and dunks his head in.Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cupdarts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl.Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woody's eyes likeglasses.             Are you alright?                   (whacking him on the back)            I'm proud of you, Sheriff.  A            lesser man would have talked under            such torture.Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cerealspoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.             I sure hope this isn't permanent.                    (checking his wrist communicator)            Still no word from Star Command.            We're not that far from the            spaceport --Woody's eyes light up. Sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection.  It's open.             The door!  It's open!  We're free!!Woody runs for the door.  Buzz follows.             Woody, we don't know what's out there!             I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH! suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway.  Woodyhides behind Buzz.             They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do            something!  Quick!             Shield your eyes!Buzz fires his laser at them.  The little red beam justflickers against Babyface's head.  The mutant toys lookconfusedly at each other.             It's not working.  I recharged it            before I left.  It should be good            for hours --             Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use            your karate chop action!Grabbing Buzz like a hostage, Woody fends off the mutanttoys by pushing a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz'sarm involuntarily ""chop"" up and down.                    (to mutants)            Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!             Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that?            Stop that!             Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!Woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway,continually chopping Buzz's arm.             Woody, stop it!!             Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!Woody drops Buzz and runs out the door. Woody races down the corridor...                    (to himself)            There's no place like home.            There's no place like home.            There's no place like home......turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps,and is confronted by... asleep on the landing.Woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast.  Heslowly backs up the stairs.Suddenly Buzz appears and pulls Woody back against thehallway wall.  He covers Woody's mouth with his hand.                    (muffled gasp)                    (whisper)            Another stunt like that, cowboy --            you're going to get us killed.                    (pulling Buzz's hand away)            Don't tell me what to do!             Shhh!Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then dartsacross the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway.Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow.Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area andmeets up with Buzz.As he stands... gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing.The toys begin to creep down the hallway, unaware thatWoody's pullstring is being pulled farther and fartheruntil --It SNAPS off the iron railing and flies back towards Woody. Both Buzz and Woody leap in surprise at the sound of Woody'svoice box. It opens.Woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring.

The noise stops the dog in his tracks.  Both Scud and Buzzlook up to see... MR. PHILLIPS is asleep on a La-Z-Boy recliner in front ofthe T.V.Scud backs out and heads down the stairs.Buzz turns to exit the room when he hears...             Calling Buzz Lightyear!!

Read            you loud and clear!Buzz turns around to see... Buzz's space ranger logo is on the screen over a field ofstars.  The image quickly changes to two young boys playingin their backyard with a Buzz Lightyear doll.             Buzz Lightyear, Planet Earth needs            your help!

The words:  NOT A FLYINGTOY flash across the bottom of the screen.

The image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds ofBuzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle.             Available at all Al's Toy Barn            outlets in the tri-county area.Buzz is stricken.  He looks down at his wrist communicatorand opens it. Molded on the underside of the cover are three words: ""MADE   Buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway.As he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look upthrough the railing at... It is open, revealing the blue sky beyond.  A bird flies past.The taunting voice of Woody echoes in his head.             You are a toy!  You can't fly!Buzz bows his head, defeated. Slowly Buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes.  Heslams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to denyits message of ""Made in Taiwan.""Buzz climbs up the railing to the banister.  He pops openhis wings, and aims himself towards the window above.             To Infinity and Beyond!Buzz leaps off the banister...and falls.In SLOW MOTION Buzz watches his square of blue sky pullfarther away from him as he plummets to the floor below. Buzz CRASHES on the entryway floor.Buzz opens his eyes to see... The broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty armsocket.Buzz drops his head back in defeat.              M-o-o-om?  Mom, have you seen my            Sally doll?Hannah walks into the entryway, and not seeing Buzz, stepson him.             What, dear?  What was that?Hannah picks up Buzz (and his arm) and smiles.             Nevermind.   The knob jiggles for a moment.  Suddenly, the door fliesopen revealing Woody, entangled in Christmas lights,standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height.Woody and the rest of the junk topple over.A bowling ball topples out, smashing Woody square on the head.             Oo-o-of!                   (to the hallway)            Buzz?!  The coast is clear.  Buzz?            Where are you?             It's a secret mission in uncharted            space!  Let's go!!Woody creeps down the hallway, dragging the Christmas lightswith him.             Really?  That is so-o-o interesting.Woody peeks into the open doorway of... Hannah is pretending to have a tea party.  Her guests aredolls, headless dolls, that is except for... He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frillyapron and fashionable party hat.                    (continued)            Would you like some tea, Mrs. Nesbit?                    (under his breath)            Buzz!Hannah has placed a tiny teapot in Buzz's severed arm andpours imaginary tea with it.             It's so nice you could join us on            such late notice.Woody steps back into the hallway.             Oh, no!             What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbit.  It            goes quite well with your head.Woody thinks for a moment, then takes a few steps furtherdown the hall.  He CLEARS HIS THROAT.                    (high voice)            Hannah!  Oh, Hannah!Hannah stops pouring tea and looks up.                    (yelling out her room)            Mom?                   (to the dolls)            Please excuse me, ladies.  I'll be            right back.As soon as Hannah exits the room Buzz keels over face-downonto the table.Hannah passes Woody, hidden in the Christmas lights, andwalks downstairs.             What is it, Mom?  Mom, where are you?Woody bolts into Hannah's room.             Buzz!  Hey, Buzz!  Are you okay?Buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair.             Gone!  It's all go-o-one!  All of            it's gone.  Bye-bye!  Whoo-hoo!            See ya!Woody picks up Buzz's severed arm.             What happened to you?             One minute you're defending the            whole galaxy...                   (pointing at other dolls)            ...and suddenly you find yourself            suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie            Antoinette and her little sisters.The headless dolls turn and wave.Woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it onthe table.             I think you've had enough tea for            today.                   (helping Buzz up)            Let's get you out of here, Buzz.                    (grabbing Woody)            Don't you get it?!  You see the hat?            I am Mrs. Nesbit!!                   (hysterical laughter)             Snap out of it, Buzz!Woody presses Buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the facewith his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet.Buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from Woody.Buzz walks out of the room while Woody follows.                    (sober)            I'm sorry.  You're right.                     (continued)            ...I'm just a little depressed,            that's all.  I can get through this.Buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees.             Oh, I'm a sham!!                    (loud whisper)            Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.             Look at me!  I can't even fly out            of a window!Woody stops short.  He looks down the hallway in thedirection of Sid's room. Woody can see straight out Sid's window across the way toAndy's bedroom window.                    (continued)            But -- the hat looked good.  Tell            me the hat looked good!  The apron            is a bit much, it's not my color...             Out the window...Buzz, you're a            genius!Woody grabs the coil of Christmas lights and drags Buzztowards Sid's room.                    (continued)            Come on, this way!             Years of Academy training...wasted!! Mr. Potato Head and Hamm are playing Battleship.  Hamm'swearing Potato Head's hat.              Miss.  G-6.             Ohhh!  You sunk it!             Heh-heh.             Are you peeking?             Oh, quit your whining and pay up.Potato Head reaches for his ear.             No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the            nose.  C'mon!                    (pulling out his                   nose; nasally)            How 'bout three out of five?He is about to hand his nose over to Hamm when...             Hey guys!  Guys!  Hey!Both toys look across the way. Woody has just finished lifting Sid's window and waves tothe toys.             Son of a building block, it's Woody!             He's in the psycho's bedroom!             Hi!                    (into Andy's bedroom)            Everyone, it's Woody! Slinky, Bo Peep and Rex look to the window.             Woody?!             You're kidding?             Woody?!              We're gonna get outta here, Buzz --            Buzz?Buzz is not there.  Woody looks down at the floor.Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing ""bombs away"" with hisbroken arm. The rest of Andy's toys gather around the window to see Woody.             Hey, look!             Woody!             Boy, am I glad to see you guys!             I knew you'd come back, Woody!             What are you doing over there?             It's a long story, Bo.  I'll            explain later.  Here, catch this!Woody tosses one end of the Christmas lights over.  Slinkycatches them.             I got it, Woody!                    (overly excited)            He got it, Woody!             Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just            tie it on to something!             Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea!            How about we DON'T?!Potato Head grabs the string of lights away from Slinky.             Hey?!!             Potato Head!?             Did you all take stupid pills this            morning?!  Have you forgotten what            he did to Buzz?  And now you want            to let him back over here?             No, no, no!  You got it all wrong,            Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz            is right here.  He's with me!             You are a liar!             No, I'm not!                   (to Buzz)            Buzz, come over here and you just            tell the nice toys that you're not            dead. He doesn't respond, preoccupied with peeling off the stickeron his wrist communicator.  He crumples it up and tosses itaside.                    (to Andy's toys)            Just a sec. Frantic, Woody walks over to the edge of the desk.             Buzz!  Will you get up here and            give me a hand?!Buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands byWoody's feet.                    (insincerely)            Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.                   (exploding)            This is serious!!             Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?             He's lyin'.  Buzz ain't there. Woody reappears at the edge of Sid's window.  He pretends tonotice something out of the other toy's view.                    (forced casualness)            Oh, hi Buzz!  Why don't you say            ""hello"" to the guys over there? suddenly appears with Woody holding the end just out ofsight.  Woody throws his voice, pretending to be Buzz.             Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and            beyond!             Hey look!  It's Buzz!                    (shaking the arm's hand)            Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the            guys our new secret best-friends            hand shake.  Gimme five, man!             Something's screwy here.             So, you see?  We're friends now,            guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?                   (as BUZZ)            You bet.  Gimme a hug.Woody makes Buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward.                    (continued; as himself)            Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.             See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back            the lights, Potato Head.             Wait just a minute.  What are you            trying to pull?!             Nothing.Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up......exposing the severed arm.The toys all SCREAM in horror.  Rex clasps his hands to hismouth and turns away to BARF.Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it'stoo late.             Oh, that is disgusting.             Murderer!             No!  No, no, no, no!             You murdering dog!             No, it's not what you think, I swear!             Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid            pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!Potato Head drops the lights.             No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave!            You've gotta help us, please!  You            don't know what it's like over here!                    (to the other toys)            Come on.  Let's get out of here.             Go back to your lives, citizens.            Show's over.All the toys leave the window except Slinky.             Come back!  Slink!  Slink, please!            Please!  Listen to me!Unable to look Woody in the eye, Slinky closes the blinds.                    (continued)            No!  No!  Come back!  SLI-I-I-INKYYY!! As storm clouds roll over Sid's house, Woody slumps over thewindow sill in defeat. BROKEN TOY SOUNDS emit from behind Woody.  He turns from thewindow to see... converging all around Buzz. Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from thedesk and runs to Buzz's rescue.             Go away, you disgusting freaks!Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with hiserector-set pinchers.Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm.Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody.             Alright back!  Back, you cannibals!Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room,crashing into the wall.By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass ofmutant toys.Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance.             He is still alive, and you're not            gonna get him, you monsters!He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his wayto... He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached.Woody's anger turns to confusion.             Hey?!  Hey, they fixed you!Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is realwhen he looks to the mutants.                    (continued)            But -- but they're cannibals.  We            saw them eat those other toys.The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid'slast ""operation"": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl.  Theirheads have been taped back on the correct bodies.The mutants all innocently stare at Woody.             Uh...sorry.  I...I thought that you            were gonna...                   (laughs nervously)            ...you know, eat my friend.Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the darkcorners of the room.             Hey!  No, no, wait!  Hey!  What's            wrong?             Sid!             Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!             Sid!!!FOOTSTEPS approach the bedroom.  Woody tries to pick up thestill depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp.             Buzz!  C'mon, get up!  Buzz,            you're...             ...get up...Woody begins dragging Buzz towards the bed, but theirprogress is too slow.  He shakes Buzz hard.             Fine.  Let Sid trash you.  But            don't blame me.Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floorand hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as...Sid enters carrying a big box.             It came!  It finally came!Sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box.                    (reverently)            The big one.He pulls out a rocket with ""THE BIG ONE"" written on it.                    (reading the rocket label)            ""Extremely dangerous.  Keep out of            reach of children.""  COOL...                   (looks around)            What am I gonna blow?  Man...hey,            where's that wimpy cowboy doll?Sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up.No Woody. Out of Sid's view, Woody presses against the inside, hangingon for dear life. Sid looks down and notices he's stepping on Buzz, activatinghis laser.             Yes!  I've always wanted to put a            spaceman into orbit.  Ha-ha.He places Buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throwsa toolbox on top of the crate.The impact of the toolbox dislodges Woody from his hidingplace.  Woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor ofthe crate ""jail.""Woody watches helplessly as Sid fishes out a roll ofelectrical tape from the toolbox and, with an IRREVERENTCHUCKLE, tapes Buzz to the rocket. A flash of lightning interrupts the moment.             Oh, no...Sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence.Sullenly, he smacks his head against the window.             Aw, man...!Woody heaves a SIGH of relief.Suddenly Sid's face brightens.  He turns his focus from therain to the Buzzrocket.                    (as Newscaster)            Sid Phillips reporting.  Launch of            the shuttle has been delayed due to            adverse weather conditions at the            launch site.  Tomorrow's forecast...Sid smacks Buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, andplaces it next to Buzz.             Sunny.  Ha-ha-ha.  Sweet dreams. Andy is being tucked into bed by his mother.  She hands himhis cowboy hat.             I looked everywhere, honey, but all            I could find was your hat.                    (groggy)            But what if we leave them behind?             Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure            we'll find Woody and Buzz before we            leave tomorrow.Andy's eyes shut.  Mom turns out the light and quietly exitsthe room.A moving box on the floor, with the words ""Andy's Toys!""scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side.                    (muffled)            Aaaah!  I need air!Rex pops out of the top of the box, COUGHING a packingstyrofoam peanut out of his mouth.  Potato Head appearsbeside him.                    (relieved)            Aa-a-a-a-ah!              Will you quit moving around?!             I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so            nervous before I travel.             How did I get stuck with YOU as a            moving buddy?Potato Head drops back down into the box.                    (following Potato Head)            Everyone else was picked. peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up atAndy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat.             Oh, Woody, if only you could see            how much Andy misses you. THUNDER RUMBLES as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling. Sid is in bed fast asleep.Woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail, but with theweight of the toolbox on top it won't budge.Woody looks across the desktop at Buzz sitting dejectedlywith the rocket strapped to his back.             Ps-s-s-s-t!  Psst!  Hey, Buzz!No reaction from Buzz.Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings itat Buzz, striking his helmet.Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody.             Hey!  Get over here and see if you            can get this tool box off me.Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head.             Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I            can't do this without you.  I need            your help.             I can't help.  I can't help anyone.             Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can            get me out of here and then I'll            get that rocket off you, and we'll            make a break for Andy's house.             Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's            the difference.             Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.            You must not be thinking clearly.             No, Woody, for the first time I am            thinking clearly.                   (looking at himself)            You were right all along.  I'm not            a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A            stupid little insignificant toy.             Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being            a toy is a lot better than being a            Space Ranger.             Yeah, right.             No, it is.  Look, over in that            house is a kid who thinks you are            the greatest, and it's not because            you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's            because you're a TOY!  You are HIS            toy.             But why would Andy want me?             Why would Andy want you?!  Look at            you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any            other toy would give up his moving            parts just to be you.  You've got            wings, you glow in the dark, you            talk, your helmet does that -- that            whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.Woody pauses and looks at himself.                    (continued; depressed)            As a matter of fact you're too cool.            I mean -- I mean what chance does a            toy like me have against a Buzz            Lightyear action figure?  All I can            do is...Woody pulls his own pull-string.             There's a snake in my boots!Woody bows his head.             Why would Andy ever want to play            with me, when he's got you?                   (pause)            I'm the one that should be strapped            to that rocket.Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz.Buzz lifts up his foot. The signature ""ANDY"" reads through the dirt and scuff marks.Buzz gazes back at Woody.  A look of determination spreadsacross his face.             Listen Buzz, forget about me.  You            should get out of here while you can.Silence.Woody turns around.Buzz is gone.Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake.  Woody looksup to see... He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off.             Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I            thought you were --             Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid            over in that house who needs us.            Now let's get you out of this thing.             Yes Sir!Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, theyfinally get it to move but it's slow progress.                    (strained)            Come on, Buzz!  We can do it! The two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench. With the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise... can be seen pulling up in front of Andy's house.             Woody!  It's the moving van.             We've got to get out of here...NOW.Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall.Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might.  The toolboxbegins to move.Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the toolchest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of thedesk.             C'mon, Buzz.Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through.Woody drops down to the floor below.                    (loud whisper)            Alright.  Buzz!  Hey!  I'm out!Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox(and milkcrate) farther out.             ...almost             ...there Woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox andmilkcrate topple towards him.                    (nervous laugh)The toolbox CRASHES right on top of Woody.Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, whostirs...                    (in his sleep)            I wanna ride the pony...Sid does not wake.  Buzz heaves a SIGH OF RELIEF, then peersover the edge of the workbench.             Woody!  Woody?!  Are you alright?!Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble.                    (punch-drunk)            No, I'm fine...I'm okay... It goes off by Sid's bed.  Woody drops back under thetoolbox and Buzz goes limp.Sid groggily sits up for a beat, then his eyes light up.             Oh, yeah!  Time for lift-off!Sid jumps out of bed, grabs Buzz and bolts out of the room. Woody leaps to his feet, runs across the room, and catchesthe door just before it closes.  As he swings the door backopen Woody is confronted by... The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody.             Aaah!  Back!  Back!  Down!  Down!Woody slams the door shut just in time.  Scud BARKS ANDSCRATCHES at the door.                    (out of breath; to himself)            Okay, what do I do?  Come on Woody,            think!Woody looks across the room. have appeared all around the room.             Guys!The mutant toys all scatter and hide.             No, no, no!  Wait!  Wait!  Listen!            Please!  There's a good toy down            there and he's -- he's going to be            blown to bits in a few minutes all            because of me.  I've gotta save him!                   (pause)            -- But I need your help.No response.Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of theshadows from under the bed.             Please.  He's my friend.  He's the            only one I've got.Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid'smetal bedpost.The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather aroundWoody.  He kneels down into a huddle with them.                    (to Babyface)            Thank you.                   (to the others)            Okay.  I think I know what to do.            We're going to have to break a few            rules, but if it works, it'll help            everybody. THE MOVERS cart out the last load.  A forlorn Andy clutchesonto Buzz's ""spaceship"" box in one hand and his cowboy hatin the other.Andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad SIGH. Sid comes out of the she carrying a bunch of materials underhis arm.                    (as Astronaut)            Houston to Mission Control.  Come            in, Control.He drops the junk down beside an inanimate Buzz.                    (continued)            Launch pad is being constructed!            Heh-heh. Scud is planted right outside Sid's bedroom door, poised toattack anything that exits. Woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard outof dominoes and Scrabble tiles.  He points to it with apencil as he addresses the mutants.             All right, listen up.  I need Pump            Boy here -- Ducky here.  Legs?LEGS, the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs, stepsforward from the crowd.                    (continued; to Legs)            You're with Ducky.                   (to the others)            RollerBob and I don't move till we            get the signal.  Clear?The mutants all give an affirmative nod.             Okay, let's move!The toys all break.Legs and DUCKY, a duck head Pez dispenser with baby dolltorso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate andpull the face plate off the wall.  They disappear into theheating duct. Ducky and Legs come to an intersection.  Ducky QUACKS andthey head down the right tunnel. HAND-IN-THE-BOX, the rubber hand in the Jack-in-the-box,stacks on top of several mutant toys to reach the doorknobof the bedroom door.Woody hops onto ROLLERBOB, a skateboard with a soldier'supper torso tied to its front.             Wind the frog!WALKING CAR, a Hot Wheels car with baby arms, begins windingup THE FROG, a tin wind-up frog with monster truck wheelsinstead of legs. A bottom of wall insulation is pushed aside to reveal Duckyand Legs.  They make their way towards a junction boxsitting in the center of the floor.Ducky and Legs lift the loose junction box.  suddenly lifts upward and disappears into the roof.Ducky extends his Pez neck out of the hole to check that thecoast is clear. All the toys have manned their positions and wait silently,their eyes fixed on Woody.             Wait for the signal. Ducky takes the end of the line off Legs' fishing reel,hooks it onto himself, and is then lowered down through theopen hole. Hanging halfway down the front door, Ducky begins to swing.Eventually he swings far enough to reach his destination:the doorbell.Ducky presses it.  Woody throws his arm down.             Go!!Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose.The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway.Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs.              I'll get it!Woody helps the rest of the mutant toys onto the skateboard.             Alright, let's go.Using his front arms, Rollerbob propels the skateboard andcrew out into the hallway.  Hannah walks to the front door...             I'm coming!  I'm coming!...and opens it. Nobody's there.Hannah doesn't notice Ducky stuck to the porch floor by hisplunger. zooms down the stairs with Scud BARKING right behind.  TheFrog leaps off the last step, speeds through Hannah's legsand out the open front door.Hannah looks back inside at Scud.  In that moment, Duckycatches the Frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into theroof.Scud bursts through Hannah's legs, knocking her over, andruns out onto the empty porch.                    (annoyed) Scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he canget back inside, Hannah slams the front door shut.             Stupid dog.Scud smashes into the closed door and begins BARKING furiously.As Hannah storms off into another room she doesn't noticeWoody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round thecorner, heading straight into the kitchen. By now RollerBob has really picked up speed.  He shootsunderneath the kitchen table, through the maze of chairlegs, straight towards...              Lean back!The mutants all push back causing the RollerBob to do awheelie.  They smash through the doggie door... ...and catapult into the bushes.The toys peek out from the bush to see Buzz strapped to thelaunchpad.  Sid is still in the toolshed.             Uh, Mission Control...is the            launchpad construction complete? --                   (simulated static)            Uh, Roger, rocket is now secured to            guide wire.  We are currently            obtaining the...ignition sticks.            Countdown will commence momentarily.            Stand by --                   (simulated static)Ducky, Legs, and the Frog shoot out into the yard from adrain pipe.  They exchange a thumbs-up with Woody.                    (to toys in the bush)            Let's go!The mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard.             Hey, Mom?!  Where are the matches?            Oh, oh, wait, here they are.            Nevermind...Woody runs towards Buzz, who spots Woody approaching.                    (loud whisper)            Woody?!  Great!  Help me out of            this thing!Woody stops a few feet away from Buzz.             Shhhhhhh!             What?!                    (loud whisper)            It's ok.  Everything's under control.Woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass.             Woody?!  What are you doing?!Sid emerges from the tool shed.  Buzz freezes.             Houston, all systems are go.            Requesting permission to launch --                   (spotting Woody)            Hey!  How'd you get out here?Sid picks up Woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles.             Oh, well, you and I can have a            cookout later.  Ha-ha-ha...He sticks a match prominently in Woody's holster and tosseshim onto the grill of an open barbecue.             Houston, do we have permission to            launch? --                   (simulated static)            Uh, Roger, permission granted.  You            are confirmed at T minus 10 seconds...During Sid's countdown, all the mutants scurry into theirfinal positions.Sid lights a match.                    (continued)            ...and counting.  Ten!  Nine!            Eight!  Seven!  Six!  Five!  Four!            Three!  Two!... One!...Sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse.             Reach for the sky!!             Huh?Sid pulls back from lighting the fuse.  He turns to look atWoody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except forthe sound emitting from his voice box.             This town ain't big enough for the            two of us!             What?!Sid walks over to Woody and picks him up.             Somebody's poisoned the water hole...             It's busted.He raises Woody up, about to throw him away --             Who are you callin' busted, Buster?!Sid stops short and looks at Woody again.                    (continued)            That's right.  I'm talking to YOU,            Sid Phillips.  We don't like being            blown up, Sid, or smashed, or            ripped apart...While Woody's voice box talks, Sid checks the pullstring.It isn't moving.  Sid GULPS.             W-w-w-we?             That's right.                   (beat)            Your toys.The remains of broken toys in the yard, led by the bedroommutants, begin rising from the ground in ""NIGHT OF THELIVING DEAD"" fashion.The toys march forward, forming a circle around Sid.  Sid istoo frightened to scream or move.             From now on, you must take good            care of your toys.  Because if you            don't, we'll find out, Sid.  We            toys can see...Woody's inanimate head rotates 360 degrees.                    (continued)            ...everything.For a split second Woody's face comes to life.                    (regular voice)            So play nice.Sid drops Woody and bolts inside the house. Woody and all the toys CHEER VICTORIOUSLY. Hannah has just come downstairs carrying a new doll when Sidrushes up to her.             The toys!  The toys are alive!Sid eyes Hannah's doll and pats it gently on the head.                    (continued)            N-N-Nice dolly...Hannah, sensing Sid's fear, suddenly thrusts the doll inSid's face.  He SCREAMS and runs upstairs.  Hannah chasesafter him, taunting.             What's wrong, Sid?!  Don't you want            to play with Sally?! The toys are all congratulating one another.             Nice work, fellahs.  Good job.            Comin' out of the ground -- what a            touch!  That was a stroke of genius.             Woody!Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed toSid's launchpad.  Buzz extends his hand to Woody.             Thanks.They shake.              Everybody say, ""Bye, house.""                    (depressed)            Bye, house.Buzz and Woody look in the direction of Andy's house. Through the fence, Andy and his family can be seen gettinginto the van.             Woody!  The van!Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to.                    (to mutant toys)            We gotta run!  Thanks, guys.With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprinttowards the fence.              Quick!Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, butBuzz's rocket causes him to become stuck. Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van beforerealizing that Buzz is missing.  He looks back to discoverBuzz stuck in the fence.             Just go!  I'll catch up!Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz.The van begins pulling out of the driveway.Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of thefence.The two toys run out into the street just in time to see thevan driving off down the street. Woody and Buzz turn around. drives right over them.  Woody and Buzz SCREAM, ducking justin time.After the truck passes, Buzz runs after it with Woody a fewsteps behind.             Come on! Scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at thesight of the two tiny toys running down the street after themoving truck.Scud bears his teeth and GROWLS. Buzz runs up close to the truck with Woody still back a fewpaces. dangles off the back of the truck.  Buzz makes a leap for itand grabs hold.  He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper.Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach.             You can do it, Woody.Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.             Whew, I made it!Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale.Woody looks behind him to see... The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs.                    (kicking Scud with                   other foot)            Aaaaaahh!!  Get away, you stupid            dog!  Down!  Down!Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap.             Hold on, Woody!             I can't do it!  Take care of Andy            for me! Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout.  He grabsScud's eyelids and snaps them hard.  Scud YELPS, letting goof Woody.  The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto hisface.             Buzz!The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz andScud behind.Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto thebumper.  He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries tolift up the heavy door.Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop ata traffic light.Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward takingWoody with it.Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truckuntil he spots what he's looking for. with the words ""ANDY'S TOYS"" written on them in crayon. Scud flings Buzz off his face.  Buzz goes tumbling under aparked car.  Scud runs over to the car, but is too big toget under it. Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes. All the toys wince and MOAN as they cover their eyes fromthe sudden brightness.             What?!             Are we there already?             Woody?!  How'd you --Woody's response is to slide the box aside and beginrummaging through the next box.Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys GRUMBLE INCONFUSION as they poke their heads up out of the first box.             Ah-hah!  There you are!!Woody pulls the RC Car and its remote out of the second box.             Hey!  What's he doing?Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the RC Carout onto the street.  The other toys SCREAM in horror.             He's at it again! Woody turns on the remote and steers the RC car past Scudand under the parked car where Buzz is hiding.RC's motor WHIRRS happily at the sight of Buzz.The traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck tocross the intersection.                    (pointing at Woody)            Get him!!!All the toys pour out of their boxes and CHARGE on Woody.             Ah-h!!  Ah-h!  No, no!Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoidthe angry mob of toys.Buzz jumps on to the RC car and they zoom back towards themoving truck.Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down onBuzz --Rocky picks up Woody and spins him over his head.             No, no, no!  Wait!                   (as Rocky spins him)            Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!-- The RC car suddenly swerves from Scud's jaws and startsdoing doughnuts (matching Woody's) in the middle of the street.                    (spinning)            Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!Rocky throws Woody to the floor.-- RC resumes his course straight down the street with Scudgiving close chase.Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody.             Pig pile!!-- The RC car hops up in the air, tossing Buzz up and off.Buzz manages to land back on RC, but facing backwards. It changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes.Buzz and the RC car drive straight into it.Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to ahalt just missing a car.  The car swerves and CRASHES intoanother car.  Soon there is a multi-car pile up thatencircles Scud, entrapping the dog.Buzz and the RC car emerge from the intersection safely onthe other side. The mob of toys lift up Woody (still holding the remote) andhead for the open back.             No wait!  You don't understand!            Buzz is out there!  We've gotta            help him!!             Toss 'im overboard!             No, no, no, wait!The toys toss him out into the road.  As the truck drivesoff, the toys CHEER.             So long Woody!  Woody turns around and ducks just in time as a car passesover him.Shaken, Woody tries to get up again when... come barreling towards him.             Who-o-o-oa!  Woody!The RC Car sweeps up Woody and keeps driving.Woody finds himself sitting in front of Buzz (still holdingthe remote).             Well, thanks for the ride.                    (pointing ahead)            Look out!!The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the carthat had passed over Woody earlier.Woody SCREAMS and gives the steering wheel on the remote ahard left, missing the tire by inches.  The RC Car moves upunder the car.             Now let's catch up to that truck! Woody flicks a switch from ""ON"" to ""TURBO.""The RC Car speeds up towards the moving truck. The toys are busy CONGRATULATING one another when Lenny, thewind-up binoculars, glances out the back and spots Buzz andWoody.             Guys!  Guys!  Woody's riding RC!            And Buzz is with him!             What?!!!The toys rush to the edge of the open truck.  Bo picks upLenny and looks through him.              It is Buzz!  Woody was telling the            truth!             What have we done?!             Great.  Now I have guilt. The RC Car begins to gain on the truck.             We're almost there.             Rocky!  The ramp!Rocky, the wrestler doll, rushes over to a lever on the sideof the back.  The sign above it reads ""RAMP: UP/DOWN.""Rocky pushes down hard on the lever.  The ramp begins to lower.Woody & Buzz look up to see the ramp about to come downright on top of them.             Look out!!The RC Car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams intothe road.  Sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping thepavement.                    (to other toys)            Quick!  Hold on to my tail!Potato Head and Rex grabs on to Slinky's tail allowingSlinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp.Slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to Woody.Woody hands the remote to Buzz and leans forward to grabSlinky's hand. They grab hold of one another.             That a boy, Slink!!All of a sudden, the RC Car begins to slow down pullingSlinky's front end off the ramp.             Woody!!His slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch...             Woody!  Speed up!                    (to Buzz)            Speed up!             The batteries!  They're running out!RC's headlight eyes sag.  The car slows even more.As Slinky continues stretching.  The RC Car begins to weaveside-to-side like a water skier.             Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa! With Mom and Andy preoccupied, baby Molly looks in hersideview mirror. The RC Car (w/ Woody and Buzz) weaves into view and thenback out.Molly SQUEALS with delight. With Slinky's mid-section stretched to the limit, he beginsto lose his grip on Woody.             I can't hold on much longer!             Slink!  Hang on!Slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back intothe moving truck and knocking over all the toys.The RC Car sputters to a stop.Woody and Buzz watch in vain as the family van and movingtruck disappear.Buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.                    (sarcastic)            Great!              Woody!  The rocket!             The match!Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had putthere earlier.                    (continued)            Yes!  Thank you, Sid!Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match againstRC's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when... whizzes right over them, blowing out the match.Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and fallsprostrate to the ground.             No-o-o!  No-no-no-no!  No-o-o!Unable to watch a cowboy cry, Buzz bows his head, causinghis helmet to block the sun from Woody.As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody stops whimpering andlooks at his hand. like the one generated from Sid's magnifying glass, appearson the back of Woody's hand.Woody leaps up, grabs Buzz's helmet and aligns it so thewhite dot hits the tip of the fuse.             Woody?!  What are you doing?             Hold still, Buzz!The fuse lights.             Ha-ha!!             You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.Woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling.             Wait a minute...I just lit a rocket.            Rockets explo -- The RC Car rockets forward.  Speeding along the dividingline in the road, it easily passes car after car until themoving truck can be seen on the horizon. The toys are gathered around Slinky, his spring splayed outon the floor.             I shoulda held on longer.Lenny looks out the back again.             Look!  Look!  It's Woody and Buzz!            Comin' up fast!The toys run to the opening and CHEER. The rocket is so strong that it begins to lift Buzz andWoody off the RC Car.  Woody manages to continue holdingonto RC -- but not for long.The toys CHEERING turns to SCREAMING as they rush to get outof the way of the oncoming ""RC rocket.""             Take cover!!Woody is forced to let go of the RC Car.They separate, sending the two toys upward and RC into theback of the truck.RC smashes into Potato Head, sending all of his parts flying. The rocket hurtles upward higher and higher.             Ahhh!! This is the part where we            blow up!             Not today!Buzz confidently presses the button on his chest. jut out of Buzz, severing the tape that holds him to rocket.The toys separate from the rocket just before it BLOWS UP.The toys plummet.                    (covering his eyes)            Ah-h-h-h-h!!Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upwardagain.  Woody takes a peek.They're flying.             Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!             This isn't flying.  This is            falling -- with style!             Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!They soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then passover it.             Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!             We're not aiming for the truck! Buzz and Woody fly right over the van's sun roof and thendrop into the car. Before anyone can notice, Woody and Buzz land in an open boxin the back seat right next to Andy.Andy turns to discover the limp Buzz and Woody lying in thebox.             Hey!  Wow!             What?  What is it?                    (picking up the toys)            Woody!  Buzz!             Oh, great, you found them.  Where            were they?             Here!  In the car!             See?  Now, what did I tell you?            Right where you left them.Andy hugs both toys. They give each other a knowing wink.  Through the gently falling snow, the Davis family can beseen around the Christmas tree unwrapping presents.             Which one can I open first?             Let's let Molly open one. One of the Christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal... The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with hisbinoculars.  He turns and motions back into the tree. A baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supportedby several green army men.  One of the soldiers turns it on. The receiving end of the monitor is atop Andy's night stand.It CRACKLES WITH STATIC.                    (over the monitor)            Frankincense, this is Myrrh.  Come            in, Frankincense.Buzz sits on the edge of Andy's bed while Hamm rests on thenightstand alongside the monitor.  They listen intently.                    (to the room)            Hey, heads up everybody!  It's            showtime.Woody and the rest of the toys are MINGLING together like atypical office Christmas party.             Oh!  It's time!The toys all stop and run towards the monitor.Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards toreveal...              Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!                   (rubbing his neck)            There's gotta be a less painful way            to get my attention.             Merry Christmas, Sheriff.She smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perchedon a shelf dangling mistletoe.             Say, isn't that mistletoe?             Mm-hmmmmm.Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and KISSES him.The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitorrestless with ""excitement"" not fear.                    (to Slinky)            Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur,            like a leaf-eater.  That way, I            could play the, uh, dominant            predator.  Ha ha ha!Slinky LAUGHS with Rex.             Quiet everyone, quiet!                    (over monitor)            Molly's first present i-i-is...Mrs.            Potato Head.  Repeat.  A Mrs.            Potato Head.             Way to go, Idaho!All the toys CONGRATULATE Potato Head.             Gee, I better shave.Potato Head whips off his moustache piece.Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz.  Lipstick nowcovers Woody's face.                    (over monitor)            Come in, Frankincense.  Andy is now            opening his first present -- Buzz bangs on the side of the monitor.  Nothing.             Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not            worried, are you?                    (over monitor)            I can't quite make out --                     (defensively)            Me?  No, no, no, no...                   (beat)            Are you?                    (laughing)            Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly            get that is worse than you?!We TRUCK OUT through the window to the EXT. as we HEAR...             Oh, what is it?  What is it?              Wow!  A puppy!We ZOOM BACK through the window to a CLOSE UP of Buzz andWoody.They look at one another with a half-smile, half-grimace and         Toy Story   :    Joss Whedon    Andrew Stanton    Joel Cohen    Alec Sokolow   :    Animation    Comedy    Family    Fantasy  User Comments      Back to IMSDb   ",happy
"    ShawShank Redemption                                     by                           Frank Darabont                        Based upon the story                 Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption	                   by Stephen King 	A dark, empty room. 	The door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and 	giggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than 	they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at 	flesh, mouths locked together. 	He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over 	instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like 	getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She 	arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against 	the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. 	He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the 	wall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not 	caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with 	the sensations running through her. He carries her across the 	room with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed. 	CAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling 	smoothly outside...  	...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the 	lovers' cries spilling into the night... 	...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting 	passion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of 	crickets and hoot owls... 	...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and	incongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until... 	...a car is revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked in a clearing.  	ANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit. 	Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly	dangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far 	from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A 	cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are 	riveted to the bungalow up the path. 	He can hear them fucking from here. 	He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio 	plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: 		You stepped out of a dream... 		You are too wonderful... 		To be what you seem... 	He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped	in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --	-- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil. 	He grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over 	the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, 	loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. 	Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. 	He shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant 	lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then 	opens the door and steps from the car.  	His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to 	the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. 	He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he 	gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more 	frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of 	passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts.  		Oh god...oh god...oh god... 	Andy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in 	orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He 	shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. 	It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left 	is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear 	languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction.  		Oh god...that's sooo good...you're 		the best...the best I ever had... 	Andy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like 	much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt 	path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun 	held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really.   	THE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, 	pale-faced and stupefied.  		Mr. Dufresne, describe the 		confrontation you had with your 		wife the night she was murdered.  	is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, 	hair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones:  		It was very bitter. She said she 		was glad I knew, that she hated all 		the sneaking around. She said she 		wanted a divorce in Reno.  		What was your response?  		I told her I would not grant one.  			(refers to his notes) 		I'll see you in Hell before I see		you in Reno. Those were the words 		you used, Mr. Dufresne, according 		to the testimony of your neighbors.  		If they say so. I really don't 		remember. I was upset.   		What happened after you and your 		wife argued?  		She packed a bag and went to stay 		with Mr. Quentin.  		Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the 		Falmouth Hills Country Club. The 		man you had recently discovered was 		her lover. 			(Andy nods) 		Did you follow her?  		I went to a few bars first. Later, 		I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's 		home and confront them. They 		weren't there...so I parked my car 		in the turnout...and waited.  		With what intention?  		I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. 		I think mostly I wanted to scare them.  		You had a gun with you?  		Yes. I did.   		When they arrived, you went up 		to the house and murdered them?  		No. I was sobering up. I realized 		she wasn't worth it. I decided to 		let her have her quickie divorce.  		Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 		caliber divorce, wrapped in a 		handtowel to muffle the shots, 		isn't that what you mean? And then 		you shot her lover!  		I did not. I got back in the car 		and drove home to sleep it off. 		Along the way, I stopped and threw 		my gun into the Royal River. I feel 		I've been very clear on this point.  		Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, 		though, is the part where the 		cleaning woman shows up the next 		morning and finds your wife and her 		lover in bed, riddled with .38 		caliber bullets. Does that strike 		you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. 		Dufresne, or is it just me?  			(softly) 		Yes. It does.  		I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't 		think the jury heard that.  		Yes. It does.  		Does what?  		Strike me as a fantastic coincidence.  		On that, sir, we are in accord...   		You claim you threw your gun into 		the Royal River before the murders 		took place. That's rather convenient.  		It's the truth.  		You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? 		He and his men dragged that river 		for three days and nary a gun was 		found. So no comparison can be made 		between your gun and the bullets 		taken from the bloodstained corpses 		of the victims. That's also rather 		convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?  			(faint, bitter smile) 		Since I am innocent of this crime, 		sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient 		the gun was never found.   	The D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation: 		Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard 		all the evidence, you know all the 		facts. We have the accused at the 		scene of the crime. We have foot 		prints. Tire tracks. Bullets 		scattered on the ground which bear 		his fingerprints. A broken bourbon 		bottle, likewise with fingerprints. 		Most of all, we have a beautiful 		young woman and her lover lying 		dead in each other's arms. They had 		sinned. But was their crime so 		great as to merit a death sentence? 	He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY.  		I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to 		that would be yes. I further 		suspect he carried out that 		sentence on the night of September 		21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, 		by pumping four bullets into his 		wife and another four into Glenn 		Quentin. And while you think about 		that, think about this... 	He picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes 	like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune.  		A revolver holds six bullets, not 		eight. I submit to you this was not 		a hot-blooded crime of passion! 		That could at least be understood, 		if not condoned. No, this was 		revenge of a much more brutal and 		cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four 		bullets per victim! Not six shots 		fired, but eight! That means he 		fired the gun empty...and then 		stopped to reload so he could shoot 		each of them again! An extra bullet 		per lover...right in the head. 			(a few JURORS shiver) 		I'm done talking. You people are 		all decent, God-fearing Christian 		folk. You know what to do.   	CAMERA TRACKS down a long table, moving from one JUROR to the 	next. These decent, God-fearing Christians are chowing down on 	a nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county, 	smacking greasy lips and gnawing cobbettes of corn.  		Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty... 	We find the FOREMAN at the head of the table, sorting votes.   	Andy stands before the dias. THE JUDGE peers down, framed by a 	carved frieze of blind Lady Justice on the wall.  		You strike me as a particularly icy 		and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. 		It chills my blood just to look at 		you. By the power vested in me by 		the State of Maine, I hereby order 		you to serve two life sentences, 		back to back, one for each of your 		victims. So be it. 	He raps his gavel as we   	slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room waits beyond.	CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit side by side at	a long table. An empty chair faces them. We are now in:  	RED enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair.  		Sit. 	Red sits, tries not to slouch. The chair is uncomfortable.  		We see by your file you've served 		twenty years of a life sentence.  		You feel you've been rehabilitated?  		Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned 		my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a 		changed man. I'm no longer a danger 		to society. That's the God's honest 		truth. No doubt about it. 	The men just stare at him. One stifles a yawn.  	A big rubber stamp slams down: ""REJECTED"" in red ink.  	High stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at	intervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are 	in the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each 	other, making deals. Exercise period. 	RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the 	activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing 	minor business. He's an important man here.  		There's a con like me in every prison 		in America, I guess. I'm the guy who 		can get it for you. Cigarettes, a 		bag of reefer if you're partial, a 		bottle of brandy to celebrate your 		kid's high school graduation. Damn 		near anything, within reason. 	He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand. 		Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears & 		Roebuck. 	TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing 	everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate 	swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside.  		So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 		1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita 		Hayworth into the prison for him, I 		told him no problem. And it wasn't.  		Fresh fish! Fresh fish today! 	Red is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. 	Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his 	group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably.  	Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains.  		Andy came to Shawshank Prison in 		early 1947 for murdering his wife 		and the fella she was bangin'. 	The bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes 	around, swallowed by prison walls.  		On the outside, he'd been vice- 		president of a large Portland bank. 		Good work for a man as young as he 		was, when you consider how 		conservative banks were back then.  		All clear! 	GUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. 	The new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking 	sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in 	front of him, almost drags him down. 	BYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into 	Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS 	and SHOUTS from the spectators.  		On your feet before I fuck you up 		so bad you never walk again.   		There they are, boys. The Human 		Charm Bracelet.  		Never seen such a sorry-lookin' 		heap of maggot shit in my life.  		Comin' from you, Heywood, you being 		so pretty and all...  		Takin' bets today, Red?  			(pulls notepad and pencil) 		Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? 		Smokes or coin, bettor's choice.  		Smokes. Put me down for two.  		High roller. Who's your horse?  		That gangly sack of shit, third 		from the front. He'll be the first.  		Bullshit. I'll take that action.  		Me too. 	Other hands go up. Red jots the names.  		You're out some smokes, son. Take 		my word.  		You're so smart, you call it.  		I say that chubby fat-ass...let's 		see...fifth from the front. Put me 		down for a quarter deck.  		That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. 		Any takers? 	More hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, 	forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching 	under the barrage of jeers and shouts. The old-timers are 	shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their 	pants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look 	terrified. Especially Andy.  		I must admit I didn't think much of 		Andy first time I laid eyes on him. 		He might'a been important on the 		outside, but in here he was just a 		little turd in prison grays. Looked 		like a stiff breeze could blow him 		over. That was my first impression 		of the man.  		What say, Red?  		Little fella on the end. Definitely. 		I stake half a pack. Any takers?  		Rich bet.  		C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me 		wrong? 			(hands go up) 		Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave 		souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it, 		gentlemen, this window's closed. 	Red pockets his notepad. A VOICE comes over the P.A. speakers:				VOICE (amplified) 		Return to your cellblocks for 		evening count.  	The new fish are marched in. Guards unlock the shackles. The	chains drop away, rattling to the stone floor.  		Eyes front. 	WARDEN SAMUEL NORTON strolls forth, a colorless man in a gray	suit and a church pin in his lapel. He looks like he could 	piss ice water. He appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes. 		This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the 		guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. 		You are sinners and scum, that's 		why they sent you to me. Rule 		number one: no blaspheming. I'll 		not have the Lord's name taken in 		vain in my prison. The other rules 		you'll figure out as you go along. 		Any questions?  		When do we eat? 	Cued by Norton's glance, Hadley steps up to the con and screams	right in his face:  	Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly. The 	man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself. 	Hadley takes his place at Norton's side again. Softly:  		Any other questions? 			(there are none) 		I believe in two things. Discipline 		and the Bible. Here, you'll receive 		both. 			(holds up a Bible) 		Put your faith in the Lord. Your 		ass belongs to me. Welcome to 		Shawshank.  		Off with them clothes! And I didn't 		say take all day doing it, did I? 	The men shed their clothes. Within seconds, all stand naked.  		First man into the shower! 	Hadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the 	front. TWO GUARDS open up with a fire hose. The con is slammed 	against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering. 	Seconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out.  		Delouse that piece of shit! Next 		man in! 	The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all	over him. Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes,	he gets shoved to a trustee's cage. The TRUSTEE slides a short	stack of items through the slot -- prison clothes and a Bible.	All the men are processed quickly -- a blast of water, powder,	clothes and a Bible...  	A naked CON steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam. 	A penlight is shined in his eyes, ears, nose, and throat.  		Bend over. 	The con does. A GUARD with a penlight in his teeth spreads his 	cheeks, peers up his ass, and nods. Andy is next up. He gets 	the same treatment.  	CAMERA TRACKS the naked newcomers shivering on hard wooden 	chairs, clothes on their laps, Bibles open.  		...maketh me to lie down in green 		pastures. He leadeth me beside the 		still waters. He restoreth my soul...  	Three tiers to a side, concrete and steel, gray and imposing. 	Andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying 	their clothes and Bibles. The CONS in their cells greet them 	with TAUNTS, JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are 	shown to their cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL.  		The first night's the toughest, no 		doubt about it. They march you in 		naked as the day you're born, fresh 		from a Bible reading, skin burning 		and half-blind from that delousing 		shit they throw on you... 	Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, 	cigarette dangling from his fingers.  		...and when they put you in that 		cell, when those bars slam home, 		that's when you know it's for real. 		Old life blown away in the blink of 		an eye...a long cold season in hell 		stretching out ahead...nothing 		left but all the time in the world 		to think about it. 	Red listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few 	others being brought up to the 2nd tier.  		Most new fish come close to madness 		the first night. Somebody always 		breaks down crying. Happens every 		time. The only question is, who's 		it gonna be? 	Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier.  		It's as good a thing to bet on as 		any, I guess. I had my money on 		Andy Dufresne...  	The bars slam home. Andy is alone in his cell, clutching his 	clothes. He gazes around at his new surroundings, taking it 	in. He slowly begins to dress himself...  	A malignant stone growth on the Maine landscape. The moon 	hangs low and baleful in a dead sky. The headlight of a 	PASSING TRAIN cuts through the night.  	Red lies on his bunk below us, tossing his baseball toward the 	ceiling and catching it again. He pauses, listening. FOOTSTEPS 	approach below, unhurried, echoing hollowly on stone.  	LOW ANGLE. A CELLBLOCK GUARD strolls into frame.  		That's lights out! Good night, ladies. 	The lights bump off in sequence. The guard exits, footsteps	echoing away. Darkness now. Silence. CAMERA CRANES UP the 	tiers toward Red's cell.  		I remember my first night. Seems a 		long time ago now. 	Red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. Listens. 	Waits. From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering.	VOICES drift through the cellblock, taunting:  		Fishee fishee fisheeee...You're 		gonna like it here, new fish. A 		whooole lot...Make you wish your 		daddies never dicked your 		mommies...You takin' this down, new 		fish? Gonna be a quiz later. 			(somebody LAUGHS) 		Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws'll 		hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee...  		The boys always go fishin' with 		first-timers...and they don't quit 		till they reel someone in. 	The VOICES keep on, sly and creepy in the dark...  	thru thru 25	2g ...while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells. One man	paces like a caged animal...another sits gnawing his cuticles	bloody...a third is weeping silently...a fourth is dry-heaving	into the toilet...  	Red waits at the bars. Smoking. Listening. He cranes his head,	peers down toward Andy's cell. Nothing. Not a peep.  		Fat-Ass...oh, Faaaat-Ass. Talk to 		me, boy. I know you're in there. I 		can hear you breathin'. Now don't 		you listen to these nitwits, hear?  	Fat-Ass is crying, trying not to hyperventilate.  		This ain't such a bad place. I'll 		introduce you around, make you feel 		right at home. I know some big ol' 		bull queers who'd love to make your 		acquaintance...especially that big 		white mushy butt of yours... 	And that's it. Fat-Ass lets out a LOUD WAIL of despair:     	The place goes nuts. Fat-Ass throws himself screaming against	the bars. The entire block starts CHANTING:  		Fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh 		fish...fresh fish...   		I had your mother! She wasn't that 		great! 	The lights bump on. GUARDS pour in, led by Hadley himself. 		What the Christ is this happy shit?  		He took the Lord's name in vain! 		I'm tellin' the warden!  			(to the unseen wit) 		You'll be tellin' him with my baton 		up your ass! 	Hadley arrives at Fat-Ass' cell, bellowing through the bars: 		What's your malfunction you fat 		fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk?   		I ain't gonna count to three! Not 		even to one! Now shut the fuck up 		'fore I sing you a lullabye! 	Fat-Ass keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freak-out. Hadley 	draws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it. 	A GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls Fat-Ass out and starts 	beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. Fat-Ass 	falls, tries to crawl. 	The place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull	THWACK-THWACK-THWACK of the baton. Fat-ass passes out. Hadley	gets in a few more licks and finally stops.  		Get this tub of shit down to the 		infirmary. 			(peers around) 		If I hear so much as a mouse fart 		in here the rest of the night, by 		God and Sonny Jesus, you'll all 		visit the infirmary. Every last 		motherfucker here. 	The guards wrestle Fat-Ass onto a stretcher and carry him off. 	FOOTSTEPS echo away. Lights off. Darkness again. Silence.  	Red stares through the bars at the main floor below, eyes 	riveted to the small puddle of blood where Fat-Ass went down.  		His first night in the joint, Andy 		Dufresne cost me two packs of 		cigarettes. He never made a sound...  	LOUD BUZZER. The master locks are thrown -- KA-THUMP! The cons 	step from their cells, lining the tiers. The GUARDS holler 	their head-counts to the HEAD BULL, who jots on a clipboard. 	Red peers at Andy, checking him out. Andy stands in line, 	collar buttoned, hair combed.  	Andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on	his tray. WE PAN ANDY through the noise and confusion...and 	discover BOGS DIAMOND and ROOSTER MacBRIDE watching Andy go 	by. Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, 	mutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs. 	Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses	a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their 	stares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something	in his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers. 	It's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with	it. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's	a senior citizen, a long-standing resident.  		You gonna eat that?  		Hadn't planned on it.  		You mind? 	Andy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling	it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine 	cigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension.  		Mmm. Nice and ripe. 	Andy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and 	feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket.	Andy breathes a sigh of relief.  		Jake says thanks. Fell out of his 		nest over by the plate shop. I'm 		lookin' after him till he's old 		enough to fly. 	Andy nods, proceeds to eat. Carefully. Heywood approaches. 		Oh, Christ, here he comes.  		Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. 		You know why it's fine? 	Heywood plops his tray down, sits. The men start pulling out	cigarettes and handing them down.  		That's right, send 'em all down. I 		wanna see 'em lined up in a row, 		pretty as a chorus line. 	An impressive pile forms. Heywood bends down and inhales	deeply, smelling the aroma. Rapture.  		Smell my ass...  		Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your 		horse comin' in last and all. 		Hell, I sure do love that horse of 		mine. I believe I owe that boy a 		big sloppy kiss when I see him.  		Give him some'a your cigarettes 		instead, cheap bastard.  		Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty 		this week? How's that winnin' horse 		of mine, anyway?  		Dead. 			(the men fall silent) 		Hadley busted his head pretty good. 		Doc already went home for the 		night. Poor bastard lay there till 		this morning. By then... 	He shakes his head, turns back to his food. The silence	mounts. Heywood glances around. Men resume eating. Softly: 		What was his name?  		What? What'd you say?  		I was wondering if anyone knew his 		name.  		What the fuck you care, new fish? 			(resumes eating) 		Doesn't matter what his fuckin' 		name was. He's dead.  	A DEAFENING NOISE of industrial washers and presses. Andy works	the laundry line. A nightmarish job. He's new at it. BOB, the	con foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done.  	Shower heads mounted in bare concrete. Andy showers with a	dozen or more men. No modesty here. At least the water is good	and hot, soothing his tortured muscles. 	Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up	and down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters. 	You're some sweet punk. You been 	broke in yet? 	Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing	serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey. 		Hard to get. I like that. 	Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving	the three Sisters laughing.  	Andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep.  	Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, 	lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the	side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. 	Heywood and Jigger pause, watching.  			(offers his hand) 		Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne. 	Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues. 		The wife-killin' banker.  		How do you know that?  		I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd 		you do it?  		I didn't, since you ask.  		Hell, you'll fit right in, then. 			(off Andy's look) 		Everyone's innocent in here, don't 		you know that? Heywood! What are 		you in for, boy?  		Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! 	Red gives Andy a look. See?  		What else have you heard?  		People say you're a cold fish. They 		say you think your shit smells 		sweeter than ordinary. That true?  		What do you think?  		Ain't made up my mind yet. 	Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the	ball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of	the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends	the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood	drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands.  		I understand you're a man who knows 		how to get things.  		I'm known to locate certain things 		from time to time. They seem to 		fall into my hands. Maybe it's 		'cause I'm Irish.  		I wonder if you could get me a 		rock-hammer?  		What is it and why?  		You make your customers' motives a 		part of your business?  		If you wanted a toothbrush, I 		wouldn't ask questions. I'd just 		quote a price. A toothbrush, see, 		is a non-lethal sort of object.  		Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about 		eight or nine inches long. Looks 		like a miniature pickaxe, with a 		small sharp pick on one end, and a 		blunt hammerhead on the other. It's 		for rocks.  		Rocks. 	Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of	dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and	rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red. 		Quartz?  		Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. 		Silted granite. There's some graded 		limestone, from when they cut this 		place out of the hill.  		So?  		I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in 		my old life. I'd like to be again, 		on a limited scale.  		Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy 		in somebody's skull?  		I have no enemies here.  		No? Just wait. 	Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them.  		Word gets around. The Sisters have 		taken a real shine to you, yes they 		have. Especially Bogs.  		Tell me something. Would it help if 		I explained to them I'm not 		homosexual?  		Neither are they. You have to be 		human first. They don't qualify. 			(off Andy's look) 		Bull queers take by force, that's 		all they want or understand. I'd 		grow eyes in the back of my head if 		I were you.  		Thanks for the advice.  		That comes free. But you understand 		my concern.  		If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- 		hammer will do me any good.  		Then I guess you wanna escape. 		Tunnel under the wall maybe? 			(Andy laughs politely) 		I miss the joke. What's so funny?  	You'll know when you see the rock- 	hammer.  		What's this item usually go for?  		Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop. 		My standard mark-up's twenty 		percent, but we're talkin' about a 		special object. Risk goes up, price 		goes up. Call it ten bucks even.  		Ten it is.  		I'll see what I can do. 			(rises, slapping dust) 		But it's a waste of money.  		Oh?  		Folks who run this place love 		surprise inspections. They turn a 		blind eye to some things, but not 		a gadget like that. They'll find 		it, and you'll lose it. Mention my 		name, we'll never do business 		again. Not for a pair of shoelaces 		or a stick of gum.  		I understand. Thank you, Mr...?  		Red. The name's Red.  		Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing 		business with you. 	They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go.  		I could see why some of the boys 		took him for snobby. He had a quiet 		way about him, a walk and a talk 		that just wasn't normal around 		here. He strolled. like a man in a 		park without a care or worry. Like 		he had on an invisible coat that 		would shield him from this place. 			(resumes playing catch) 		Yes, I think it would be fair to 		say I liked Andy from the start.  	Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table. Andy falls in	step, slips him a tightly-folded square of paper.  	Lying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square. A ten dollar bill. 		He was a man who adapted fast.  	Under watchful supervision, CONS are off-loading bags of dirty	laundry from an ""Eliot Nursing Home"" truck.  		Years later, I found out he'd 		brought in quite a bit more than 		just ten dollars... 	A certain bag hits the ground. The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look 	at a black con, LEONARD, then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot 	the shit. Leonard loads the bag onto a cart...  	Bags are being unloaded. We find Leonard working the line.  		When they check you into this 		hotel, one of the bellhops bends 		you over and looks up your works, 		just to make sure you're not 		carrying anything. But a truly 		determined man can get an object 		quite a ways up there. 	Leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry 	bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting... 4l	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41	Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where 	the clean sheets are being handed out.  		That's how Andy joined our happy 		little Shawshank family with more 		than five hundred dollars on his 		person. Determination. 	Leonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of 	clean sheets. He hands it across to Red --  	-- and more than clean laundry changes hands. Two packs of	cigarettes slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's.  	Red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to 	make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. He pulls out the 	rock-hammer. It's just as Andy described. Red laughs softly.  		Andy was right. I finally got the 		joke. It would take a man about six 		hundred years to tunnel under the 		wall with one of these.  	Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. The 	rolling library. He finds Red waiting for him. Red slips the 	rock-hammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the	cart. Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage.  	Dufresne. 	Brooks nods, never missing a beat. He rolls his cart to 	Andy's cell, mutters through the bars:  		Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel. 	Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object 	disappear. The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of 	folded paper along with more cigarettes. Brooks turns his cart	around and goes back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough	for Red to snag the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, 	scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket.  	Red unfolds the slip of paper. Penciled neatly on it is a 	single word: ""Thanks.""  	We are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line. 	Andy is doing his job, getting good at it.  	Andy nods. He leaves the line, weaving his way through the 	laundry room and into --  	-- a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and	furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of 	cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. Andy hefts a 	cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack, turns around -- 	-- and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle. blocking his way.	Rooster looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness	on the left. A frozen beat. Andy slams the Hexlite to the	floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful. 		You get this in your eyes, it 		blinds you.  		Honey, hush. 	Andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through 	the maze. The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes 	riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. 	Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. That's all it takes. 	They're on him in an instant, kicking and stomping. 	Andy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from 	behind. They propel him across the room and slam him against 	an old four-pocket machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams 	a rag into Andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like 	a horse bit. Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete 	have his arms firmly pinned. Bogs whispers in Andy's ear:  		That's it, fight. Better that way. 	Andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. CAMERA PULLS BACK, 	SLOWLY WIDENING. The big Washex blocks our view. All we see 	is Andy's screaming face and the men holding him down... 	...and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM, leaving the dark place 	and the dingy act behind...MOVING up empty corridors, past 	concrete walls and steel pipes...  		I wish I could tell you that Andy 		fought the good fight, and the 		Sisters let him be. I wish I could 		tell you that, but prison is no 		fairy-tale world. 	WE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard, WIDENING for 	a final view of the line. The giant steel ""mangler"" is 	slapping down in brutal rhythm. The sound is deafening.  		He never said who did it...but we 		all knew. 	PRISON MONTAGE: (1947 through 1949)  	shaping his rocks after lights-out...  		Things went on like that for a 		while. Prison life consists of 		routine, and then more routine.   		Every so often, Andy would show up 		with fresh bruises.   		The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes 		he was able to fight them off... 		sometimes not.  	wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors.  		He always fought, that's what I 		remember. He fought because he knew 		if he didn't fight, it would make 		it that much easier not to fight 		the next time. 	The rake connects, snapping off over somebody's skull. They 	beat the hell out of him.  		Half the time it landed him in the 		infirmary...  	A stone closet. No bed, sink, or lights. Just a toilet with no 	seat. Andy sits on bare concrete, bruised face lit by a faint 	ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door.  		...the other half, it landed him in 		solitary. Warden Norton's ""grain & 		drain"" vacation. Bread, water, and 		all the privacy you could want.  	Andy is working the line.  		And that's how it went for Andy. That 		was his routine. I do believe those 		first two years were the worst for 		him. And I also believe if things 		had gone on that way, this place 		would have got the best of him. 		But then, in the spring of 1949, 		the powers-that-be decided that...  	Warden Norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn:  		...the roof of the license-plate 		factory needs resurfacing. I need a 		dozen volunteers for a week's work. 		We're gonna be taking names in this 		steel bucket here... 	Red glances around at his friends. Andy also catches his eye. 		It was outdoor detail, and May is 		one damn fine month to be workin' 		outdoors.  	Cons shuffle past, dropping slips of paper into a bucket.  		More than a hundred men volunteered 		for the job. 	Red saunters to a guard named TIM YOUNGBLOOD, mutters 	discreetly in his ear.  	Youngblood is pulling names and reading them off. Red 	exchanges grins with Andy and the others.  		Wouldn't you know it? Me and some 		fellas I know were among the names 		called.  	Red slips Youngblood six packs of cigarettes.  		Only cost us a pack of smokes per 		man. I made my usual twenty 		percent, of course.  	A tar-cooker bubbles and smokes. TWO CONS dip up a bucket of	tar and tie a rope to the handle. The rope goes taught. CAMERA	FOLLOWS the bucket of tar up the side of the building to --  	-- where it is relayed to the work detail. the men are dipping	big Padd brushes and spreading the tar. ANGLZ OVER to Byron 	Hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards:  		...so this shithead lawyer calls 		long distance from Texas, and he 		says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He 		says, sorry to inform you, but your 		brother just died.  		Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that.  		I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off 		years ago, family ain't heard of him 		since. Figured him for dead anyway. 		So this lawyer prick says, your 		brother died a rich man. Oil wells 		and shit, close to a million bucks. 		Jesus, it's frigging incredible how 		lucky some assholes can get.  		A million bucks? Jeez-Louise! You 		get any of that?  		Thirty five thousand. That's what 		he left me.  		Dollars? Holy shit, that's great! 		Like winnin' a lottery... 			(off Hadley's shitty look) 		...ain't it?  		Dumbshit. What do you figger the 		government's gonna do to me? Take a 		big wet bite out of my ass, is what.  		Oh. Hadn't thought of that.  		Maybe leave me enough to buy a new 		car with. Then what happens? You 		pay tax on the car. Repairs and 		maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' 		you to take 'em for a ride...  		And drive it, if they're old enough.  		That's right, wanting to drive it, 		wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! 		Then at the end of the year, if you 		figured the tax wrong, they make 		you pay out of your own pocket. 		Uncle Sam puts his hand in your 		shirt and squeezes your tit till 		it's purple. Always get the short 		end. That's a fact. 			(spits over the side) 		Some brother. Shit. 	The prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work.  		Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin' 		luck. Imagine inheriting thirty 		five thousand dollars.  		Crying shame. Some folks got it 		awful bad. 	Red glances over -- and is shocked to see Andy standing up,	listening to the guards talk.  		Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on 		your pail! 	Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley. 		Andy! Come back! Shit!  		What's he doing?  		Gettin' himself killed.  		God damn it...  		Just keep spreadin' tar... 	The guards stiffen at Andy's approach. Youngblood's hand goes	to his holster. The tower guards CLICK-CLACK their rifle 	bolts. Hadley turns, stupefied to find Andy there.  		Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife?  		That's funny. You're gonna look 		funnier suckin' my dick with no 		fuckin' teeth.  		What I mean is, do you think she'd 		go behind your back? Try to 		hamstring you?  		That's it! Step aside, Mert. This 		fucker's havin' hisself an accident. 	Hadley grabs Andy's collar and propels him violently toward	the edge of the roof. The cons furiously keep spreading tar. 		Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's 		gonna throw him off the roof...  		Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus...  		Because if you do trust her, there's 		no reason in the world you can't 		keep every cent of that money. 	Hadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge. In 	fact, Andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips 	scraping the roof. The only thing between him and an ugly drop	to the concrete is Hadley's grip on the front of his shirt. 		You better start making sense.  		If you want to keep that money, all 		of it, just give it to your wife. 		See, the IRS allows you a one-time- 		only gift to your spouse. It's good 		up to sixty thousand dollars.  		Naw, that ain't right! Tax free?  		Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent. 	The cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion. 		You're the smart banker what shot 		his wife. Why should I believe a 		smart banker like you? So's I can 		wind up in here with you?  		It's perfectly legal. Go ask the 		IRS, they'll say the same thing. 		Actually, I feel silly telling you 		all this. I'm sure you would have 		investigated the matter yourself.  		Fuckin'-A. I don't need no smart 		wife-killin' banker to show me where 		the bear shit in the buckwheat.  		Of course not. But you will need 		somebody to set up the tax-free 		gift, and that'll cost you. A 		lawyer, for example...  		Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing 		cocksuckers!  		...or come to think of it, I 		suppose I could set it up for you. 		That would save you some money. 		I'll write down the forms you need, 		you can pick them up, and I'll 		prepare them for your signature... 		nearly free of charge. 			(off Hadley's look) 		I'd only ask three beers apiece for 		my co-workers, if that seems fair.  			(guffawing) 		Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, 		ain't it? Co-workers... 	Hadley freezes him with a look. Andy presses on:  		I think a nan working outdoors 		feels more like a man if he can 		have a bottle of suds. That's only 		my opinion. 	The convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. They	look like they've been pole-axed. Hadley shoots them a look. 		What are you jimmies starin' at? 		Back to work, goddamn it!  	As before, an object is hauled up the side of the building by	rope -- only this time, it's a cooler of beer and ice.  		And that's how it came to pass, 		that on the second-to-last day of 		the job, the convict crew that 		tarred the plate factory roof in 		the spring of '49...  	The cons are taking the sun and drinking beer.  		...wound up sitting in a row at ten 		o'clock in the morning, drinking icy 		cold Black Label beer courtesy of 		the hardest screw that ever walked 		a turn at Shawshank State Prison.  		Drink up, boys. While it's cold.  		The colossal prick even managed to 		sound magnanimous. 	Red knocks back another sip, enjoying the bitter cold on his	tongue and the warm sun on face.  		We sat and drank with the sun on 		our shoulders, and felt like free 		men. We could'a been tarring the 	roof of one of our own houses. We 	were the Lords of all Creation. 	He glances over to Andy squatting apart from the others. 		As for Andy, he spent that break 		hunkered in the shade, a strange 		little smile on his face, watching 		us drink his beer.  			(approaches with a beer) 		Here's a cold one, Andy.  		No thanks. I gave up drinking. 	Heywood drifts back to others, giving them a look.  		You could argue he'd done it to 		curry favor with the guards. Or 		maybe make a few friends among us 		cons. Me, I think he did it just to 		feel normal again...if only for a 		short while.  	Andy and Red play checkers. Red makes his move.  		King me.  		Chess. Now there's a game of kings. 		Civilized...strategic...  		...and totally fuckin' 		inexplicable. Hate that game.  		Maybe you'll let me teach you 		someday. I've been thinking of 		getting a board together.  		You come to the right place. I'm 		the man who can get things.  		We might do business on a board. But 		the pieces, I'd like to carve those 		myself. One side done in quartz... 		the opposing side in limestone.  		That'd take you years.  		Years I've got. What I don't have 		are the rocks. Pickings here in the 		exercise yard are pretty slim.  		How's that rock-hammer workin' out 		anyway? Scratch your name on your 		wall yet?  			(smiles) 		Not yet. I suppose I should.  		Andy? I guess we're gettin' to be 		friends, ain't we?  		I suppose we are.  		I ask a question? Why'd you do it?  		I'm innocent, remember? Just like 		everybody else here. 	Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing.  		What are you in for, Red?  		Murder. Same as you.  		Innocent?  		The only guilty man in Shawshank.  	Andy lies in his bunk after lights out, polishing a fragment 	of quartz by the light of the moon. He pauses, glancing at 	all the names scratched in the wall. He rises, makes sure 	the coast is clear, and starts scratching his name into the 	cement with his rock-hammer, adding to the record.  	fills the screen in glorious (and scratchy) black & white, 	suffering a bad case of DT's...  	...while a CONVICT AUDIENCE hoots and catcalls, talking back 	to the screen. We find Red slouched in a folding chair, 	watching the movie. Andy enters, backlit by the flickering 	glare of the projector, and takes a seat next to him.  		Here's the good part. Bugs come out 		of the walls to get his ass.  		I know. I've seen it three times 		this month already. 	Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS with 	him, high-pitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets.  		Can we talk business?  		Sure. What do you want?  		Rita Hayworth. Can you get her?  		No problem. Take a few weeks.  		Weeks?  		Don't have her stuffed down my 		pants this very moment, sorry to 		say. Relax. What are you so nervous 		about? She's just a woman. 	Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, 	turns back to the movie.  	Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark 	figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and 	Pete. Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant 	bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a 	door open and drag him into --  	-- where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con	blinking at them through thick bifocals.  		Take a walk.  		I have to change reels.  		I said fuck off. 	Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams 	and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room.  		I know. I've seen it three times 		this month already. 	Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS witt 	him, high-pitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets.  		Can we talk business?  		Sure. What do you want?  		Rita Hayworth. Can you get her?  		No problem. Take a few weeks.  		Weeks?  		Don't have her stuffed down my 		pants this very moment, sorry to 		say. Relax. What are you so nervous 		about? She's just a woman. 	Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, 	turns back to the movie.  	Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark 	figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and 	Pete. Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant 	bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a 	door open and drag him into --  	-- where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con	blinking at them through thick bifocals.  		Take a walk.  		I have to change reels.  		I said fuck off. 	Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams 	and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room.  		Ain't you gonna scream? 	Andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector.  		They'd never hear me over that. 		Let's get this over with. 	Seemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind 	bench -- and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel	of 35mm film. Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others. 		Me first.  		Okay. 	Andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing	it into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall.  		Fuck! Shit! He broke my nose! 	Andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his	knees. Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious 	eight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it.  		Now I'm gonna open my fly, and 		you're gonna swallow what I give 		you to swallow. And when you 		d mine, you gonna swallow 		Rooster's. You done broke his nose, 		so he ought to have somethin' to 		show for it.  		Anything you put in my mouth, 		you're going to lose.  		You don't understand. You do that, 		I'll put all eight inches of this 		steel ii your ear.  		Okay. But you should know that 		sudden serious brain injury causes 		the victim to bite down. Hard. 			(faint smile) 		In fact, I understand the bite-reflex 		is so strong the victim's jaws have 		to be pried open with a crowbar. 	The Sisters consider this carefully. The film runs out of the 	projector, flapping on the reel. The screen goes white.  		You little fuck. 	Andy gets a bootheel in the face. The Sisters start kicking 	and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can 	get their hands on. In the theater, the convicts are CHANTING 	AND CLAPPING for the movie to come back on.  		Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's 		mouth, and neither did his friends. 		What they did do is beat him within 		an inch of his life...  	Andy lies wrapped in bandages.  		Andy spent a month in traction.   		Bogs spent a week in the hole. 	Bogs sits on bare concrete. The steel door slides open.  		Time's up, Bogs.  	Bogs comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette. Not many 	cons around; the place is virtually deserted. A VOICE 	echoes dimly over the P.A. system:  		Return to your cellblocks for 		evening count. 	Bogs enters his cell. Dark in here. He fumbles for the light 	cord, yanks it. The sudden light reveals Captain Hadley six 	inches from his face, waiting for him. Mert steps in behind 	Bogs. hemming him. 	Before Bogs can even open his mouth to say ""what the fuck,"" 	Hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar 	plexus. Bogs doubles over, gagging his wind out.  	Ernie comes slowly around the corner, rolling a steel mop 	cart loaded with supplies.  	Red is darning a sock in his open cell. He pauses, frowning, 	hearing strange THUMPING sounds. What the hell is that?  	It's Hadley and Mert methodically and brutally pulping Bogs 	with their batons, and kicking the shit out of him for good 	measure. He feebly tries to ward them off.  	Puzzled, Red steps from his cell, following the sound. It 	dawns on him that it's coming from above. He moves to the 	railing and leans out, craning around to look up --  	-- just as Bogs flips over the railing and comes sailing	directly toward us, eyes bugging out, SCREAMING as he falls.  	jumps back as Bogs plummets past, missing him by inches, arms 	swimming and trying to grab the railing (but missing that 	too), SCREAMING aaaaalll the way down --  	-- and impacting on Ernie's gassing mop cart in an enormous 	eruption of solvents and cleansers. The cart is squashed flat, 	shooting out from under Bogs and skidding across the cellblock 	floor like a tiddly wink, kicking up sparks for thirty yards. 	Ernie is left gaping in shock at Bogs and all the Bogs-related 	wreckage at his feet.  	Red is stunned. He very tentatively leans out and looks up. 	Above him, Hadley and Mert lean on the 3rd tier railing. 	Hadley tilts the cap back on his head, shakes his head.  		Damn, Byron. Look'a that.  		Poor fella must'a tripped. 	A tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of Hadley's shoe and 	splashes across Red's upturned cheek. He wipes it off, then 	looks down at Bogs. Cons and guards are racing to the scene.  		Two things never happened again 		after that. The Sisters never laid 		a finger on Andy again...  	Bogs, wheelchair-bound and wearing a neck brace, is loaded 	onto an ambulance for transport. Behind the fence stand Red 	and his friends, watching.  		...and Bogs never walked again. They 		transferred him to a minimum security 		hospital upstate. To my knowledge, 		he lived out the rest of his days 		drinking his food through a straw.  		I'm thinkin' Andy could use a nice 		welcome back when he gets out of 		the infirmary.  		Sounds good to us. Figure we owe 		him for the beer.  		Man likes to play chess. Let's get 		him some rocks.  	A HUNDRED CONS at work. Hoes rise and fall in long waves. 	GUARDS patrol on horseback. Heywood turns up a rocky chunk, 	quickly shoves it down his pants. He maneuvers to Red and the 	others, pulls out the chunk and shows it to them.  		That ain't quartz. Nor limestone.  		What are you, fuckin' geologist?  		He's right, it ain't.  		What the hell is it then?  		Horse apple.  		Bullshit.  		No, horse shit. Petrified. 	Cackling, the men go back to work. Heywood stares at the rock.	He crumbles it in his hands.  		Despite a few hitches, the boys 		came through in fine style...  	A huge detergent box is filled with rocks, hidden in the 	shadows behind a boiler furnace.  		...and by the week Andy was due 		back, we had enough rocks saved up 		to keep him busy till Rapture. 	ANGLE SHIFTS to Red as he plops a bag of ""laundry"" on the 	floor. Leonard and Bob toss a few more down. Red starts 	pulling out contraband, giving them their commissions.  		Also got a big shipment in that 		week. Cigarettes, chewing gum, 		shoelaces, playing cards with naked 		ladies on 'em, you name it... 			(pulls a cardboard tube) 		...and, of course, the most 		important item.  	Andy, limping a bit, returns from the infirmary. Red watches 	from his cell as Andy is brought up and locked away.  	Andy finds the cardboard tube lying on his bunk.  		Lights out! 	The lights go off. Andy opens the tube and pulls out a large 	rolled poster. He lets it uncurl to the floor. A small scrap 	of paper flutters out, landing at his feet. The poster is the	famous Rita Hayworth pin-up -- one hand behind her head, eyes	half closed, sulky lips parted. Andy picks up the scrap of 	paper. It reads: ""No charge. Welcome back."" Alone in the dark,	Andy smiles.  	The BUZZER SOUNDS, the cells SLAM OPEN. Cons step from their	cells. Andy catches Red's eye, nods his thanks. As the men 	shuffle down to breakfast, Red glances into Andy's cell --  	-- and sees Rita in her new place of honor on Andy's wall. 	Sunlight casts a harsh barred shadow across her lovely face. 	Ernie is mopping the floor. He glances back and sees Warden 	Norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a DOZEN 	GUARDS. Still mopping, Ernie mutters to the nearest cell:  		Heads up. They're tossin' cells. 	Word travels fast from cell to cell. Cons scramble to tidy up	and hide things. Norton enters, nods to his men. The guards 	pair off in all directions, making their choices at random.  		What kind'a contraband you hiding 		in there, boy? 	Cells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, 	mattresses overturned. Whatever contraband is found gets 	tossed out onto the cellblock floor. Mostly harmless stuff. 	A GUARD pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress, 	shoots a nasty look at the CON responsible.  		Solitary. A week. Make sure he 		takes his Bible.  		Too goddamn dark to read down there. 		Add another week for blasphemy. 	The man is taken away. Norton's gaze goes up.  		Let's try the second tier.  	Norton arrives, makes a thin show of picking a cell at random.	He motions at Andy on his bunk, reading his Bible. The door is	unlocked. Norton enters, trailed by his men. Andy rises.  		Good evening. 	Norton gives a curt nod. Hadley and Trout start tossing the	cell in a thorough search. Norton keeps his eyes on Andy,	looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink. He takes the	Bible out of Andy's hand.  		I'm pleased to see you reading 		this. Any favorite passages?  		Watch ye therefore, for ye know not		when the master of the house cometh.  			(smiles) 		Luke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I've 		always liked that one. 			(strolls the cell) 		But I prefer: ""I am the light of 		the world. He that followeth me 		shall not walk in darkness, but 		shall have the light of life.""  		John. Chapter 8, verse 12.  		I hear you're good with numbers. 		How nice. A man should have a skill.  		You wanna explain this? 	Andy glances over. Hadley is holding up a rock blanket, a	polishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt.  		It's called a rock blanket. It's 		for shaping and polishing rocks. 		Little hobby of mine. 	Hadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill, turns to	Norton.  		Looks pretty clean. Some contraband 		here, nothing to get in a twist over. 	Norton nods, strolls to the poster of Rita.  		I can't say I approve of this... 			(turns to Andy) 		...but I suppose exceptions can 		always be made. 	Norton exits, the guards follow. The cell door is slammed and	locked. Norton pauses, turns back.  		I almost forgot. 	He reaches through the bars and returns the Bible to Andy.  		I'd hate to deprive you of this. 		Salvation lies within. 	Norton and his men walk away.  		Tossin' cells was just an excuse. 		Truth is, Norton wanted to size 		Andy up.  	Andy is working the line. Hadley enters and confers briefly 	with Bob. Bob nods, crosses to Andy, taps him. Andy turns, 	removes an earplug. Bob shouts over the machine noise:   	Andy is led in. Norton is at his desk doing paperwork. Andy's	eyes go to a framed needle-point sampler on the wall behind 	him that reads: ""HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON.""  		My wife made that in church group.  		It's very pretty, sir.  		You like working in the laundry?  		No, sir. Not especially.  		Perhaps we can find something more 		befitting a man of your education.  	A series of bleak rooms stacked high with unused filing 	cabinets, desks, paint supplies, etc. Andy enters. He hears a	FLUTTER OF WINGS. An adult crow lands on a filing cabinet and	struts back and forth, checking him out. Andy smiles.  		Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks? 	Brooks Hatlen pokes his head out of the back room.  		Andy! Thought I heard you out here!  		I've been reassigned to you.  		I know, they told me. Ain't that a 		kick in the ass? Come on in, I'll 		give you the dime tour.  	Brooks leads Andy into the bleakest back room of all. Rough	plank shelves are lined with books. Brooks' private domain. 		Here she is, the Shawshank Prison 		Library. Along this side, we got 		the National Geographics. That 		side, the Reader's Digest Condensed 		books. Bottom shelf there, some 		Louis L'Amours and Erle Stanley 		Gardners. Every night I pile the 		cart and make my rounds. I write 		down the names on this clipboard 		here. Well, that's it. Easy, peasy, 		Japanesey. Any questions? 	Andy pauses. Something about this doesn't make any sense. 		Brooks? How long have you been 		librarian?  		Since 1912. Yuh, over 37 years.  		In all that time, have you ever had 		an assistant?  		Never needed one. Not much to it, 		is there?  		So why now? Why me?  		I dunno. Be nice to have some 		comp'ny down here for a change.  		Dufresne!  	another GUARD, a huge fellow named DEKINS.  		That's him. That's the one. 	Hadley exits. Dekins approaches Andy ominously. Andy stands 	his ground, waiting for whatever comes next. Finally:  		I'm Dekins. I been, uh, thinkin' 		'bout maybe settin' up some kinda 		trust fund for my kids' educations. 	Andy covers his surprise. Glances at Brooks. Brooks smiles. 		I see. Well. Why don't we have a 		seat and talk it over?  		Pull down one'a them desks there. 	Andy and Dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the	floor. They find chairs and settle in. Brooks returns with a 	tablet of paper and a pen, slides them before Andy.  		What did you have in mind? A weekly 		draw on your pay?  		Yuh. I figured just stick it in the 		bank, but Captain Hadley said check 		with you first.  		He was right. You don't want your 		money in a bank.  		I don't?  		What's that gonna earn you? Two and 		a half, three percent a year? We 		can do a lot better than that. 			(wets his pen) 		So tell me, Mr. Dekins. Where do 		you want to send your kids? 		Harvard? Yale?   		He didn't say that!  		God is my witness. And Dekins, he 		just blinks for a second, then 		laughs his ass off. Afterward, he 		actually shook Andy's hand.  		My ass!  		Shook his fuckin' hand. Just about 		shit myself. All Andy needed was a 		suit and tie, a jiggly little hula 		girl on his desk, he would'a been 		Mister Dufresne, if you please.  		Makin' yourself some friends, Andy.  		I wouldn't say ""friends."" I'm a 		convicted murderer who provides 		sound financial planning. That's a 		wonderful pet to have.  		Got you out of the laundry, didn't 		it?  		Maybe it can do more than that. 			(off their looks) 		How about expanding the library? 		Get some new books in there.  		How you 'spect to do that, ""Mr. 		Dufresne-if-you-please?""  		Ask the warden for funds. 	LAUGHTER all around. Andy blinks at them.  		Son, I've had six wardens through 		here during my tenure, and I have 		learned one great immutable truth 		of the universe: ain't one of 'em 		been born whose asshole don't 		pucker up tight as a snare drum 		when you ask for funds.  	DOLLYING Norton and Andy up the hall:  		Not a dime. My budget's stretched 		thin as it is.  		I see. Perhaps I could write to the 		State Senate and request funds 		directly from them.  		Far as them Republican boys in 		Augusta are concerned, there's only 		three ways to spend the taxpayer's 		hard-earned when it come to prisons. 		More walls. More bars. More guards.  		Still, I'd like to try, with your 		permission. I'll send a letter a 		week. They can't ignore me forever.  		They sure can, but you write your 		letters if it makes you happy. I'll 		even mail 'em for you, how's that?  	Andy is on his bunk, writing a letter.  		So Andy started writing a letter a 		week, just like he said.  	Andy pops his head in. The GUARD shakes his head.  		And just like Norton said, Andy got 		no answers. But still he kept on.  	Andy is doing taxes. Mert Entwhistle is seated across from	him. Other off-duty guards are waiting their turn.  		The following April, Andy did tax 		returns for half the guards at 		Shawshank.  	Tax time again. Even more guards are waiting.  		Year after that, he did them all... 		including the warden's.  	A BATTER in a ""Noresby Marauders"" baseball uniform WHACKS the	ball high into left field and races for first.  		Year after that, they rescheduled 		the start of the intramural season 		to coincide with tax season...  	The Batter sits across from Andy. The line winds out the door. 		The guards on the opposing teams 		all remembered to bring their W-2's.  		Moresby Prison issued you that gun, 		but you actually had to pay for it?  		Damn right, and the holster too.  		See, that's all deductible. You get 		to write that off.  		Yes sir, Andy was a regular H&R 		Block. In fact, he got so busy at 		tax time, he was allowed a staff. 	ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Red and Brooks doing filing chores.  		Say Red, could you hand me a stack 		of those 1040s?  		Got me out of the wood shop a month 		out of the year, and that was fine 		by me.  	Andy enters and drops a letter on the outgoing stack.  		And still he kept sending those 		letters...  	Dark. Andy's in his bunk, polishing a four-inch length of 	quartz. It's a beautifully-crafted chess piece in the shape of 	a horse's head, poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone. 	He puts the knight on a chess board by his bed, adding it to 	four pieces already there: a king, a queen, and two bishops. 	He turns to Rita. Moonlight casts bars across her face.  	Floyd runs into the yard, scared and winded. He finds Andy and 	Red on the bleachers.  		Red? Andy? It's Brooks.  	Floyd rushes in with Andy and Red at his heels. They find 	Jigger and Snooze trying to calm Brooks, who has Heywood in a 	chokehold and a knife to his throat. Heywood is terrified.  		C'mon, Brooksie, why don't you just 		calm the fuck down, okay?  		Goddamn miserable puke-eatin' sons 		of whores! 	He kicks a table over. Tax files explode through the air.  		What the hell's going on?  		You tell me, man. One second he was 		fine, then out came the knife. I 		better get the guards.  		No. We'll handle this. Ain't that 		right, Brooks? Just settle down and 		we'll talk about it, okay?  		Nothing left to talk about! It's all 		talked out! Nothing left now but to 		cut his fuckin' throat!  		Why? What's Heywood done to you?  		That's what they want! It's the 		price I gotta pay! 	Andy steps forward, rivets Brooks with a gaze. Softly:  		Brooks, you're not going to hurt 		Heywood, we all know that. Even 		Heywood knows it, right Heywood?  			(nods, terrified) 		Sure. I know that. Sure.  		Why? Ask anyone, they'll tell you. 		Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man.  			(cuing nods all around) 		Yeah, that's right. That's what 		everybody says.  		You're not fooling anybody, so just 		put the damn knife down and stop 		scaring the shit out of people.  		But it's the only way they'll let 		me stay. 	Brooks bursts into tears. The storm is over. Heywood staggers	free, gasping for air. Andy takes the knife, passes it to Red.	Brooks dissolves into Andy's arms with great heaving sobs. 		Take it easy. You'll be all right.  		Him? What about me? Crazy old 		fool! Goddamn near slit my throat!  		You've had worse from shaving. 		What'd you do to set him off?  		Nothin'! Just came in to say 		fare-thee-well. 			(off their looks) 		Ain't you heard? His parole came 		through! 	Red and Andy exchange a surprised look. Andy wants to 	understand. Red just motions to let it be for now. He puts his	arm around Brooks, who sobs inconsolably. Softly:  	Ain't that bad, old hoss. Won't be 	long till you're squiring pretty 	young girls on your arm and telling 	'em lies.   		I just don't understand what 		happened in there, that's all.  		Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin 		shithouse, is what.  		Heywood, enough. Ain't nothing 		wrong with Brooksie. He's just 		institutionalized, that's all.  		Institutionalized, my ass.  		Man's been here fifty years. This 		place is all he knows. In here, 		he's an important man, an educated 		man. A librarian. Out there, he's 		nothing but a used-up old con with 		arthritis in both hands. Couldn't 		even get a library card if he 		applied. You see what I'm saying?  		Red, I do believe you're talking 		out of your ass.  		Believe what you want. These walls 		are funny. First you hate 'em, then 		you get used to 'em. After long 		enough, you get so you depend on 		'em. That's ""institutionalized.""  		Shit. I could never get that way.  			(softly) 		Say that when you been inside as 		long as Brooks has.  		Goddamn right. They send you here 		for life, and that's just what they 		take. Part that counts, anyway.  	The sun rises over gray stone.  	ANGLE ON RITA POSTER. Sexy as ever. The rising sun sends 	fingers of rosy light creeping across her face.  	Brooks stands on a chair, poised at the bars of a window, 	cradling Jake in his hands.  		I can't take care of you no more. 		You go on now. You're free. 	He tosses Jake through the bars. The crow flaps away.  	TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the gate. It 	swings hugely open, revealing Brooks standing in his cheap 	suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. 	Brooks walks out, tears streaming down his face. He looks 	back. Red, Andy, and others stand at the inner fence, seeing 	him off. The massive gate closes, wiping them from view.  	Brooks is riding the bus, clutching the seat before him, 	gripped by terror of speed and motion.  		Dear Fellas. I can't believe how 		fast things move on the outside.  	Brooks looks like a kid trying to cross the street without his 	parents. People and traffic a blur.  		I saw an automobile once when I was 		young. Now they're everywhere.  	Brooks comes trudging up the sidewalk. He glances up as a 	prop-driven airliner streaks in low overhead.  		The world went and got itself in a 		big damn hurry. 	He arrives at the Brewster. It ain't much to look at.  	A WOMAN leads Brooks up the stairs toward the top floor. He 	has trouble climbing so many stairs.  		No music in your room after eight 		p.m. No guests after nine. No 		cooking except on the hotplate...  		People even talk faster. And louder.  	Brooks enters. The room is small, old, dingy. Heavy wooden 	beams cross the ceiling. An arched window affords a view of 	Congress Street. Traffic noise drifts in. Brooks sets his bag 	down. He doesn't quite know what to do. He just stands there, 	like a man waiting for a bus.  		The parole board got me into this 		halfway house called the Brewster, 		and a job bagging groceries at the 		Foodway...  	Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. Brooks is bagging 	groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking.  		Make sure he double-bags. Last time 		your man didn't double-bag and the 		bottom near came out.  		You double-bag like the lady says, 		understand?  		Yes sir, double-bag, surely will.  		It's hard work. I try to keep up, 		but my hands hurt most of the time. 		I don't think the store manager 		likes me very much.  	Brooks sits alone on a bench, feeding pigeons.  		Sometimes after work I go to the 		park and feed the birds. I keep 		thinking Jake might show up and say 		hello, but he never does. I hope 		wherever he is, he's doing okay and 		making new friends.  	Dark. Traffic outside. Brooks wakes up. Disoriented. Afraid.	Somewhere in the night, a LOUD ARGUMENT is taking place.  		I have trouble sleeping at night. 		The bed is too big. I have bad 		dreams, like I'm falling. I wake 		up scared. Sometimes it takes me a 		while to remember where I am.   		Maybe I should get me a gun and rob 		the Foodway, so they'd send me home. 		I could shoot the manager while I 		was at it, sort of like a bonus.  	Brooks is packing his worldly possessions into the carry bag. 	Undershirts, socks, etc.  		But I guess I'm too old for that 		sort of nonsense anymore.  	Brooks is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, 	puts his hat on his head. The letter lies on the desk, stampe3 	and ready for mailing. His bag is by the door.  		I don't like it here. I'm tired of 		being afraid all the time. I've 		decided not to stay. 	He takes one last look around. Only one thing left to do. He 	steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s 	pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam. 	He steps up onto the chair. It wobbles queasily. Now facing	the beam, he carves a message into the wood: ""Brooks Hatlen	was here."" He smiles with a sort of inner peace.  		I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. 		Not for an old crook like me.  	His weight shifts on the wobbly chair -- and it goes out 	from under him. His feet remain where they are, kicking feebly 	in mid-air. His hat falls to the floor. 	ANGLE WIDENS. Brooks has hanged himself. He swings gently, 	facing the open window. Traffic noise floats up from below.  	Andy reads the letter to Red and the others:  		P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a 		knife to his throat. No hard feelings. 	A long silence. Andy folds the letter, puts it away. Softly:  		He should'a died in here, goddamn it.  	Andy is sorting books on the cart. He replaces a stack on the	shelf -- and pauses, noticing a line of ants crawling up the	wood. He glances up. The ants disappear over the top. He pulls	a chair over and stands on it, peers cautiously over.  		Red! 	Red steps in with an armload of files. Andy gingerly reaches	in, grabs a black feathered wing, and pulls out a dead crow. 			(softly) 		Is that Jake?  	Red is making something at his bench, sanding and planing.  		It never would have occurred to us, 		if not for Andy. It was his idea. 		We all agreed it was the right 		thing to do...  	Low hilly terrain all around. A HUNDRED CONS are at work in 	the fields. GUARDS patrol with carbines, keeping a sharp eye.	We find Andy, Red, and the boys working with picks and 	shovels. They glance over to the pickup truck. Hadley's 	chewing the fat with Mert and Youngblood. A WHISTLE BLOWS.  		Water break! Five minutes! 	The work stops. Cons head for the pickup truck, where water is	dispensed with dipper and pail. Red and the boys look to Andy.	Andy nods. Now's the time. The group moves off through the 	confusion, using it as cover. They head up the slope of a 	nearby hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot. The 	guards haven't noticed. 	Jigger and Floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth, 	quickly ripping out a hole. Red reaches into his jacket and 	pulls out a beautiful wooden box, carefully stained and 	varnished. He shows it around to nods of approval.  		That's real pretty, Red. Nice work.  		Shovel man in. Watch the dirt.  	Heywood jumps in and starts spading out the hole.  	Youngblood glances up and sees the men on the slope.  		What the fuck.  			(follows his gaze)  			(works his rifle bolt)  	Suddenly, other cons start breaking away in groups, dozens of	them heading toward the slope. The guards look around.  		What am I, talkin' to myself?  	Andy pulls a towel-wrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds	it. Jake. Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook's 	letter. Red places the casket in the hole. A moment of 	silence. Andy gives Red with an encouraging nod.  		Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was 		just a crow. Neither was much to 		look at. Both got institutionalized. 		See what you can do for 'em. Amen. 	Muttered ""amens"" all around. The boys shovel dirt onto the 	small grave and tamp it down.  	RAPID DOLLY with Hadley. He's striding, pissed-off, a man on e	mission. He straight-arms a door and emerges onto --  	-- the wall overlooking the exercise yard. He leans on the	railing, scans the yard, sees Andy chatting with Red.  		Dufresne! What the fuck did you do? 			(Andy looks up) 		Your ass, warden's office, now! 	Andy shoots a worried look at Red, then heads off.  	Dozens of parcel boxes litter the floor. WILEY, the duty 	guard, picks through them. Hadley enters, trailed by Andy. 		What is all this?  		You tell me, fuck-stick! They're 		addressed to you, every damn one! 	Wiley thrusts an envelope at Andy. Andy just stares at it. 		Well, take it. 	Andy takes the envelope, pulls out a letter, reads:  		Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to		your repeated inquiries, the State		Senate has allocated the enclosed		funds for your library project... ""			(stunned, examines check) 		This is two hundred dollars. 	Wiley grins. Hadley glares at him. The grin vanishes.  		In addition, the Library District		has generously responded with a		charitable donation of used books		and sundries. We trust this will		fill your needs. We now consider		the matter closed. Please stop		sending us letters. Yours truly,		the State Comptroller's Office.	Andy gazes around at the boxes. The riches of the world lay at	his feet. His eyes mist with emotion at the sight.  		I want all this cleared out before 		the warden gets back, I shit you not. 	Hadley exits. Andy touches the boxes like a love-struck man	touching a beautiful woman. Wiley grins.  		Good for you, Andy.  		Only took six years. 			(beat) 		From now on, I send two letters a 		week instead of one.  			(laughs, shakes his head) 		I believe you're crazy enough. You 		better get this stuff downstairs 		like the Captain said. I'm gonna go 		pinch a loaf. When I get back, this 		is all gone, right? 	Andy nods. Wiley disappears into the toilet, Jughead Comix in 	hand. Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a 	starving man exploring packages of food. He doesn't know where 	to turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling 	out books, touching them, smelling them. 	He rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph	player, industrial gray and green, the words ""Portland Public	School District"" stenciled on the side. The box also contains	stacks and stacks of used record albums. 	Andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping 	through them. Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc. 	He comes across a certain album -- Mozart's ""Le Nozze de 	Figaro."" He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man 	transfixed. It is a thing of beauty. It is the Grail.  	Wiley sits in one of the stalls, Jughead comic on his knees.  	Andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, 	sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. He plugs the 	machine in. A red light warms up. The platter starts spinning. 	He slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the 	platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. The 	needle HISSES in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting 	and gorgeous. Andy sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its 	beauty. It is ""Deutino: Che soave zeffiretto,"" a duet sung by 	Susanna and the Contessa.  	Wiley pauses reading, puzzled. He thinks he hears music.  		Andy? You hear that?  	Andy shoots a look at the bathroom...and smiles. Go for broke. 	He lunges to his feet and barricades the front door, then the 	bathroom. He returns to the desk and positions the P.A. 	microphone. He works up his courage, then flicks all the 	toggles to ""on."" A SQUEAL OF FEEDBACK echoes briefly...  	...and the Mozart is suddenly broadcast all over the prison.  	Wiley lunges to his feet, pants tangling around his ankles.  	Cons all over the prison stop whatever they're doing, freezing 	in mid-step to listen, gazing up at the speakers.     	thru yard...the numbing routine of prison life itself...all grinds thru 	just stands in place, listening to the MUSIC, hypnotized.  	Andy is reclined in the chair, transported, arms fluidly 	conducting the music. Ecstasy and rapture. Shawshank no 	longer exists. It has been banished from the mind of men.  	CAMERA TRACKS along groups of men, all riveted.  		I have no idea to this day what 		them two Italian ladies were 		singin' about. Truth is, I don't 		want to know. Some things are best 		left unsaid. I like to think they 		were singin' about something so 		beautiful it can't be expressed in 		words, and makes your heart ache 		because of it. 	CAMERA brings us to Red.  		I tell you, those voices soared. 		Higher and farther than anybody in 		a gray place dares to dream. It was 		like some beautiful bird flapped 		into our drab little cage and made 		these walls dissolve away...and for 		the briefest of moments -- every 		last man at Shawshank felt free.  	FAST DOLLY with Norton striding up the hallway with Hadley.  		It pissed the warden off something 		terrible.  	Norton and Hadley break the door in. Andy looks up with a 	sublime smile. We hear Wiley POUNDING on the bathroom door:   	LOW ANGLE SLOW PUSH IN on the massive, rust-streaked steel 	door. God, this is a terrible place to be.  		Andy got two weeks in the hole for 		that little stunt.  	Andy doesn't seem to mind. His arms sweep to the music still 	playing in his head. We hear a FAINT ECHO of the soaring duet.   		Couldn't play somethin' good, huh? 		Hank Williams?  		They broke the door down before I 		could take requests.  		Was it worth two weeks in the hole?  		Easiest time I ever did.  		Shit. No such thing as easy time in 		the hole. A week seems like a year.  		I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. 		Hardly felt the time at all.  		Oh, they let you tote that record 		player down there, huh? I could'a 		swore they confiscated that stuff.  			(taps his heart, his head) 		The music was here...and here. 		That's the one thing they can't 		confiscate, not ever. That's the 		beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt 		that way about music, Red?  		Played a mean harmonica as a younger 		man. Lost my taste for it. Didn't 		make much sense on the inside.  		Here's where it makes most sense. 		We need it so we don't forget.  		Forget?  		That there are things in this world 		not carved out of gray stone. That 		there's a small place inside of us 		they can never lock away, and that 		place is called hope.  		Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a 		man insane. It's got no place here. 		Better get used to the idea.  			(softly) 		Like Brooks did?   	slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond. 	CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit at a long 	table. An empty chair faces them. We are again in:  	Red enters, ten years older than when we first saw him at a 	parole hearing. He removes his cap and sits. 				MAN #l 		It says here you've served thirty 		years of a life sentence.  		You feel you've been rehabilitated?  		Yes sir, without a doubt. I can say 		I'm a changed man. No danger to 		society, that's the God's honest 		truth. Absolutely rehabilitated.  	A big rubber stamp slams down: ""REJECTED.""  	Red emerges into fading daylight. Andy's waiting for him. 		Same old, same old. Thirty years. 		Jesus. When you say it like that...  		You wonder where it went. I wonder 		where ten years went. 	Red nods, solemn. They settle in on the bleachers. Andy pulls 	a small box from his sweater, hands it to Red.  		Anniversary gift. Open it. 	Red does. Inside the box, on a thin layer of cotton, is a 	shiny new harmonica, bright aluminum and circus-red.  		Had to go through one of your 		competitors. Hope you don't mind. 		Wanted it to be a surprise.  		It's very pretty, Andy. Thank you.  		You gonna play something?  	Red considers it, shakes his head. Softly:  		Not today.  	Men line the tiers as the evening count is completed. The 	convicts step into their cells. The master switch is thrown 	and all the doors slam shut -- KA-THUMP! Andy finds a 	cardboard tube on his bunk. The note reads: ""A new girl for 	your 10 year anniversary. From your pal. Red.""  	Marilyn Monroe's face fills the screen. SLOW PULL BACK reveals	the new poster: the famous shot from ""The Seven Year Itch,"" 	on the subway grate with skirt billowing up. Andy sits gazing 	at her as lights-out commences...  	...and we find Red gazing blankly as darkness takes the 	cellblock. Adding up the months, weeks, days... 	He regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a Martian 	artifact. He considers trying it out -- even holds it briefly 	to his lips, almost embarrassed -- but puts it back in its box	untested. And there the harmonica will stay...  156 	WE HOLD IN BLACKNESS as THUMPING SOUNDS grow louder... 156 		Andy was as good as his word. He 		kept writing to the State Senate. 		Two letters a week instead of one. 	...and the BLACKNESS disintegrates as a wall tumbles before 	our eyes, revealing a WORK CREW with picks and sledgehammers, 	faces obscured outlaw-style with kerchiefs against the dust. 	Behind them are GUARDS overseeing the work. 	Andy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration. Red	and the others follow suit. They step through the hole in the	wall, exploring what used to be a sealed-off storage room.  		In 1959, the folks up Augusta way 		finally clued in to the fact they 		couldn't buy him off with just a 		200 dollar check. Appropriations 		Committee voted an annual payment of 		500 dollars, just to shut him up.  	TRACKING the construction. Walls have been knocked down. Men 	are painting, plastering, hammering. Lots of shelves going up.	Red is head carpenter. We find him discussing plans with Andy. 		Those checks came once a year like 		clockwork.  	Red and the boys are opening boxes, pulling out books.  		You'd be amazed how far Andy could 		stretch it. He made deals with book 		clubs, charity groups...he bought 		remaindered books by the pound...  		Treasure Island. Robert Louis...  			(jotting) 		...Stevenson. Next?  		I got here an auto repair manual, 		and a book on soap carving.  		Trade skills and hobbies, those go 		under educational. Stack right 		behind you.  		The Count of Monte Crisco...  		Cristo, you dumbshit.  		...by Alexandree Dumb-ass.  		Dumas. You boys'll like that one. 		It's about a prison break. 	Floyd tries to take the book. Heywood yanks it back. I saw it 	first. Red shoots Andy a look.  		Maybe that should go under 		educational too.  	Red is making a sign, carefully routing letters into a long 	plank of wood. It turns out to be --  	-- the varnished wood sign over the archway: ""Brooks Hatlen 	Memorial Library."" TILT DOWN to reveal the library in all its 	completed glory: shelves lined with books, tables and chairs, 	even a few potted plants. Heywood is wearing headphones, 	listening to Hank Williams on the record player.  		By the year Kennedy was shot, Andy 		had transformed a broom closet 		smelling of turpentine into the 		best prison library in New England.  	FLASHBULBS POP as Norton addresses MEMBERS OF THE PRESS:  		That was also the year Warden Norton 		instituted his famous ""Inside-Out"" 		program. You may remember reading 		about it. It made all the papers 		and got his picture in LIFE magazine.  		...a genuine, progressive advance 		in corrections and rehabilitation. 		Our inmates, properly supervised, 		will be put to work outside these 		walls performing all manner of 		public service. Cutting pulpwood, 		repairing bridges and causeways, 		digging storm drains... 	ANGLE TO Red and the boys listening from behind the fence.  		These men can learn the value of an 		honest day's labor while providing 		a valuable service to the community 		-- and at a bare minimum of expense		to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer!  		Sounds like road-gangin', you ask me.  		Nobody asked you.  	A ROAD-GANG is grading a culvert with picks. There's dust and 	the smell of sweat in the air. GUARDS patrol with sniper rifles,	A pushy WOMAN REPORTER in an ugly hat bustles up the grade, 	trailed by a PHOTOGRAPHER.  		You there! You men! We're gonna 		take your picture now!  		Give us a break, lady.  		Don't you know who I am? I'm from 		LIFE magazine! I was told I'd get 		some co-operation out here! You 		want me to report you to your 		warden? Is that what you want?  			(sighs) 		No, ma'am.  		That's more like it! Now I want you 		all in a row with big bright smiles 		on your faces! Grab hold of your 		tools and show 'em to me! 	She turns, motioning her photographer up the grade. Heywood 	glances around at the other men.  		You heard the lady. 	Heywood unzips his pants, reaches inside. The others do 	likewise. The woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of 	a dozen men displaying their penises and smiling brightly. Her	legs go wobbly and she sits heavily down on the dirt grade.  		C'mon! We're showin' our tools and 		grinnin' like fools! Take the damn 		picture!  	Heywood sits alone in the dark. He sighs.  		None of the inmates were invited to 		express their views...  	A ROAD-GANG is pulling stumps, bogged down in mud.  		'Course, Norton failed to mention 		to the press that ""bare minimum of 		expense"" is a fairly loose term. 		There are a hundred different ways 		to skim off the top. Men, 		materials, you name it. And, oh my 		Lord, how the money rolled in... 	Norton strolls into view with NED GRIMES at his heels.  		This keeps up, you're gonna put me 		out of business! With this pool of 		slave labor you got, you can 		underbid any contractor in town.  		Ned, we're providing a valuable 		community service.  		That's fine for the papers, but I 		got a family to feed. The State 		don't pay my salary. Sam, we go 		back a long way. I need this new 		highway contract. I don't get it, I 		go under. That's a fact. 			(hands him a box) 		Now you just have some'a this fine 		pie my missus baked specially for 		you, and you think about that. 	Norton opens the box. Alongside the pie is an envelope. He	runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains.	IN THE BACKGROUND, a winch cable SNAPS and whips through the	air, damn near severing a man's leg. He goes down, screaming	in mud and blood, pinned by a fallen tree stump. Men rush over	to help him. Norton barely takes notice.  		Ned, I wouldn't worry too much over 		this contract. Seems to me I've 		already got my boys committed 		elsewhere. You be sure and thank 		Maisie for this fine pie.  	ANGLE on Maisie's pie. Several pieces gone.  		And behind every shady deal, behind 		every dollar earned... 	TILT UP to Andy at the desk, munching thoughtfully as he 	totals up figures on an adding machine.  		...there was Andy, keeping the books. 	Andy finishes preparing two bank deposits. Norton hovers near 	the desk, keeping a watchful eye.  		Two deposits, Casco Bank and New 		England First. Night drop, like 		always. 	Norton pockets the envelopes. Andy crosses to the wall safe 	and shoves the ledger and sundry files inside. Norton locks 	the safe, swings his wife's framed sampler back into place. He 	cocks his thumb at some laundry and two suits in the corner.  		Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two 		suits for dry-clean and a bag of 		whatnot. Tell 'em if they over- 		starch my shirts again, they're 		gonna hear about it from me. 			(adjusts his tie) 		How do I look?  		Very nice.  		Big charity to-do up Portland 		way. Governor's gonna be there. 			(indicates pie) 		Want the rest of that? Woman can't 		bake worth shit.  	Andy trudges down the corridor with Norton's laundry, the pie 	box under his arm.  	TILT UP FROM PIE to find Red munching away as he helps Andy 	sort books on the shelves.  		Got his fingers in a lot of pies, 		from what I hear.  		What you hear isn't half of it. 		He's got scams you haven't dreamed 		of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. 		There's a river of dirty money 		flowing through this place.  		Money like that can be a problem. 		Sooner or later you gotta explain 		where it came from.  		That's where I come in. I channel 		it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, 		securities, tax free municipals... 		I send that money out into the big 		world. And when it comes back...  		It's clean as a virgin's whistle?  		Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, 		I will have made him a millionaire.  		Jesus. They ever catch on, he's 		gonna wind up wearing a number 		himself.  			(smiles) 		I thought you had more faith in me 		than that.  		I'm sure you're good, but all that 		paper leaves a trail. Anybody gets 		too curious -- FBI, IRS, whatever -- 		that trail's gonna lead to somebody.  		Sure it will. But not to me, and 		certainly not to the warden.  		Who then?  		Peter Stevens.  		Who?  		The silent, silent partner. He's 		the guilty one, your Honor. The man 		with the bank accounts. That's 		where the filtering process starts. 		They trace it back, all they're 		gonna find is him.  		Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he? 		A phantom. An apparition. Second 		cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. 			(off Red's look) 		I conjured him out of thin air. He 		doesn't exist...except on paper.  		You can't just make a person up.  		Sure you can, if you know how the 		system works, and where the cracks 		are. It's amazing what you can 		accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has 		a birth certificate, social 		security card, driver's license. 		They ever track those accounts, 		they'll wind up chasing a figment 		of my imagination.  		Jesus. Did I say you were good? 		You're Rembrandt.  		It's funny. On the outside, I was 		an honest man. Straight as an 		arrow. I had to come to prison to 		be a crook.   		Does it ever bother you?  		I don't run the scams, Red, I just 		process the profits. That's a fine 		line, maybe. But I've also built 		that library, and used it to help a 		dozen guys get their high school 		diplomas. Why do you think the 		warden lets me do all that?  		To keep you happy and doing the 		laundry. Money instead of sheets.  		I work cheap. That's the trade-off. 	TWO SIREN BLASTS draw their attention to the main gate. It 	swings open, revealing a prison bus waiting outside.  	Among those on board is TOMMY WILLIAMS, a damn good-looking 	kid in his mid-20's. The bus RUMBLES through the gate.  	The new fish disembark, chained together single-file. The old- 	timers holler and shake the fence. A deafening gauntlet.  	Tommy and the others are marched in naked and shivering, 	covered with delousing powder, greeted by TAUNTS and JEERS.  	The bars slam with a STEEL CLANG. Tommy and his new CELLMATE 	take in their new surroundings.  		Well. Ain't this for shit?  	DOLLYING Tommy as he struts along, combing his ducktail, 	cigarette behind his ear. (We definitely need The Coasters or 	Del Vikings on the soundtrack here. Maybe Jerry Lee Lewis.)  		Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 		1965 on a two year stretch for B&E. 		Cops caught him sneakin' TV sets 		out the back door of a JC Penney.  	A SHRIEKING BUZZSAW slices ten-foot lengths of wood. Red runs 	the machine while some other OLD-TIMERS feed the wood.  		Young punk, Mr. Rock n' Roll, cocky 		as hell... 	Tommy is hauling the cut wood off the conveyor and stacking it, 	It's a ball-busting job, but the kid's a blur.  			(slapping his gloves) 		C'mon there, old boys! Movin' like 		molasses! Makin' me look bad! 	The old guys just grin and shake their heads.  		We liked him immediately.  	Tommy regales the old boys with his exploits:  		...so I'm backin' out the door, 		right? Had the TV like this... 			(mimes his grip) 		Big ol' thing. Couldn't see shit. 		Suddenly, here's this voice: 		Freeze kid! Hands in the air! 		Well I just stand there holdin' on 		to that TV, so the voice says: ""You 		hear what I said, boy?"" And I say, 		Yes sir, I sure did! But if I drop		this fuckin' thing, you got me on 		destruction of property too!	The whole table falls about laughing.  	Poker game in progress. Tommy, Andy, Red and the boys.  		You did a stretch in Cashman too?  		Yeah. That was an easy ride, let me 		tell you. Work programs, weekend 		furloughs. Not like here.  		Sounds like you done time all over 		New England.  		Been in and out since I was 13. Name 		the place, chances are I been there.  		Perhaps it's time you considered a 		new profession. 			(the game stalls) 		What I mean is, you don't seem to 		be a very good thief. Maybe you 		should try something else.  		What the hell you know about it, 		Capone? What are you in for?  			(wry glance to Red) 		Everyone's innocent in here. Don't 		you know that? 	The tension breaks. Everyone laughs.  	CAMERA TRAVELS the room. Chaotic. CONS are waiting their turn 	or talking to visitors through a thick plexi shield.  		As it turns out, Tommy had himself 		a young wife and new baby girl... 	Tommy's at the end of the row, phone to his ear. Other side of	the glass is BETH, near tears, fussing with a BABY on her lap. 	...said we can stay with them, but 	Joey's gettin' out of the service 	next month, and they barely got 	enough room as it is. Plus they got 	Poppa workin' double shifts and the 	baby cries half the night. I just 	don't know where we're gonna go... 	PUSH IN on Tommy's face as he listens.  		Maybe it was the thought of them on 	the streets...or his child growing 	up not knowing her daddy...  	Tommy enters, the strut gone from his step. A little scared. 	He finds Andy filing library cards.  		Whatever it was, something lit a 		fire under that boy's ass.  		I'm thinkin' maybe I should try for 		high school equivalency. Hear you 		helped some fellas with that.  		I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.  			(tight) 		I ain't no goddamn loser.  		That's a good start. If we do this, 		we do it all the way. One hundred 		percent. Nothing half-assed. 	Tommy thinks about it, nods.  		Thing is, see... 			(leans in, mutters) 		...I don't read all that good.  			(smiles) 		Well. You've come to the right 		place then.  	We find Andy giving an impassioned reading:  		...and the lamplight o'er him		streaming throws his shadow on the		floor...and my soul from out that		shadow that lies floating on the		floor, shall be lifted nevermore! ""	Andy slaps the book shut, immensely pleased with himself. 		So this raven just sits there and 		won't go away?  		That's right.  			(beat) 		Why don't that fella get hisself a 		12-gauge and dust the fucker?  	Tommy tries to read as Andy looks on:  		The cat sh--The cat shh... 			(glances up) 		The cat shat on the welcome mat? 	Andy shakes his head. Not exactly.  	Andy chalks the alphabet on a blackboard.  		So Andy took Tommy under his wing. 		Started walking him through his 		ABCs...  	TRACK the table to Tommy and Andy. Discussing a book.  		Tommy took to it pretty well, too. 		Boy found brains he never knew he 		had.   		The cat sh--shh--shimmied up the 		tree and crept st--stel--stealthily 		out on the limb...  	Tommy intent on a paperback, mouthing the words. Behind him,	wood is piling up on the conveyor belt.  		After a while, you couldn't pry 		those books out of hands.  		Ass in gear, son! You're putting us 		behind! 	Tommy shoves the book in his back pocket and hurries over. 	Tommy writes a sentence on the blackboard. Andy steps in, 	shows him how to reconstruct it.  		Before long, Andy started him on 		his course requirements. He really 		liked the kid, that was part of it. 		Gave him a thrill to help a 		youngster crawl off the shitheap. 		But that wasn't the only reason...  	TIGHT ANGLE on chessboard. Most of the pieces complete. PAN TO 	Andy lying in his bunk, carefully polishing...  		Prison time is slow time. Sometimes 		it feels like stop-time. So you do 		what you can to keep going... 	...and we keep going past Andy in a SLOW PAN of the cell. 	Sink. Toilet. Books. Outside the window bars, we hear another 	TRAIN passing in the night...  		Some fellas collect stamps. Others 		build matchstick houses. Andy built 		a library. Now he needed a new project. 		Tommy was it. It was the same reason 		he spent years shaping and polishing 		those rocks. The same reason he hung 		his fantasy girlies on the wall... 	...STILL PANNING, past a chair, a sweater on a hook...and 	finally to the place of honor on the wall...  		In prison, a man'll do most 		anything to keep his mind occupied. 	...where the latest poster turns out to be Racquel Welch ins	fur bikini. Gorgeous. ""One Million Years, B. C. "" SLOW PUSH IN, 		By 1966...right about the time 		Tommy was getting ready to take his 		exams...it was lovely Racquel.  	Tommy's taking the big test. Andy's monitoring the time. Deep 	silence, save for Tommy's pencil-scribbling. A few old-timers 	are browsing the shelves, sneaking looks their way. Tommy 	tries to ignore them. Concentrate. 	Andy clears his throat. Time's up. Tommy puts his pencil down,  		Well?  		Well. It's for shit. 			(gets up in disgust) 		Wasted a whole fuckin' year of my 		time with this bullshit!  		May not be as bad as you think.  		It's worse! I didn't get a fuckin' 		thing right! Might as well be in 		Chinese!  		We'll see how the score comes out.  		I'll tell you how the goddamn 		score comes out... 	Tommy grabs the test, wads it, slam-dunks it into the trash. 		Two points! Right there! There's 		your goddamn score! 			(storms out) 		Goddamn cats crawlin' up trees, 5 		times 5 is 25, fuck this place, 		fuck it! 	Tommy is gone. Red and others stare. Andy gets up, pulls the 	test from the trash, smoothes it out on the desk.  	Rest break. Tommy and Red sipping Cokes.  		I feel bad. I let him down.  		That's crap, son. He's proud of 		you. Proud as a hen. 			(off Tommy's look) 		We been friends a long time. I know 		him as good as anybody.  		Smart fella, ain't he?  		Smart as they come. Used to be a 		banker on the outside.  		What's he in for anyway?  		Murder.  		The hell you say.  		You wouldn't think, lookin' at him. 		Caught his wife in bed with some 		golf pro. Greased 'em both. C'mon, 		boy, back to work... 	SMASH! Red turns back. Tommy's Coke has slipped from his hand 	and shattered on the floor. The kid's gone white as a sheet.  			(bare whisper) 		Oh my God...  	Tommy sits before Andy and Red:  		'Bout four years ago, I was in 		Thomaston on a 2 to 3 stretch. 		Stole a car. Dumbfuck thing to do. 			(beat) 		Few months left to go, I get a new 		cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big 		twitchy fucker. Crazy eyes. Kind of 		roomie you pray you don't get, know 		what I'm sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed 		burglary. Said he done hundreds of 		jobs. Hard to believe, high-strung 		as he was. Cut a loud fart, he'd go 		three feet in the air. Talked all 		the time, too, that's the other 		thing. Never shut up. Places he'd 		been, jobs he pulled, women he 		fucked. Even people he killed. 		People that gave him shit, that's 		how he put it. One night, like a 		joke, I say: ""Yeah? Who'd you 		kill?"" So he says...  		...I got me this job one time 		bussin' tables at a country club. 		So I could case all the big rich 		pricks that come in. I pick out 		this guy, go in one night and do 		his place. He wakes up and gives 		me shit. So I killed him. Him and 		the tasty bitch he was with. 			(starts laughing) 		That's the best part! She's fuckin' 		this prick, see, this golf pro, but 		she's married to some other guy! 		Some hotshot banker. He's the one 		they pinned it on! They got him 		down-Maine somewhere doin' time for 		the crime! Ain't that choice? 	He throws his head back and ROARS with laughter.  	Silence. Tommy has finished his story. Red is stunned...but 	Andy looks like he's been smacked with a two by four.  		Andy? 	Andy says nothing. Walks stiffly away. Doesn't look back.   		Well. I have to say, that's the 		most amazing story I ever heard. 		What amazes me most is you were 		taken in by it.  		Sir?  		It's obvious this fellow Williams 		is impressed with you. He hears 		your tale of woe and quite 		naturally wants to cheer you up. 		He's young, not terribly bright. 		Not surprising he didn't know what 		a state he'd put you in.  		I think he's telling the truth.  		Let's say for a moment Blatch does 		exist. You think he'd just fall to 		his knees and cry, ""Yes, I did it! 		I confess! By all means, please add		a life term to my sentence!""  		It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's 		testimony, I can get a new trial.  		That's assuming Blatch is even 		still there. Chances are excellent 		he'd be released by now. Excellent. 		They'd have his last known address.		Names of relatives... 			(Norton shakes his head)		Well it's a chance. isn't it? How		can you be so obtuse?  		What? What did you call me?  		Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The 		country club will have his old time		cards! W-2s with his name on them!  			(rises) 		Dufresne, if you want to indulge 		this fantasy, that's your business.		Don't make it mine. This meeting's 		over.  		Look, if it's the squeeze, don't 		worry. I'd never say what goes on 		in here. I'd be just as indictable 		as you for laundering the money!  		Don't you ever mention money to me 		again, you sorry son of a bitch! 		Not in this office, not anywhere! 			(slaps intercom) 		Get in here! Now!  		I was just trying to rest your mind		at ease, that's all.  			(as GUARDS enter) 		Solitary! A month! 	Andy gets dragged away, kicking and screaming:  		What's the matter with you? It's my 		chance to get out, don't you see 		that? It's my life! Don't you 		understand it's my life?  	Mail call. Men crowd around as names are called out. Red and	the boys are parked on the bleachers.  		A month in the hole. Longest damn 		stretch I ever heard of.  		It's my fault.  		Like hell. You didn't pull the 		trigger, and you didn't convict him.  		Red? You saying Andy's innocent? I 		mean for real innocent? 			(Red nods) 		Sweet Jesus. How long's he been in 		here?  		Since '47. Going on nineteen years.  		Thomas Williams! 	Tommy raises his hand. The envelope gets tossed to him. He	stares at it. Red peers over his shoulder.  		Board of Education.  		The son of a bitch mailed it.  		Looks that way. You gonna open it 		or stick your thumb up your butt?  		Thumb up my butt sounds better. 	He gets hemmed in by the older men. Red snatches the letter.  		C'mon, just throw it away. Will you 		please? Just throw it away? 	Red rips it open, scans the letter. Expressionless.  		Well, shit.  	Tommy makes his way through the chaos, finds Beth and the baby 	waiting behind the thick plexi shield. He sits, doesn't pick 	up the phone. Just stares at Beth. She doesn't know what to 	make of it. 	He presses a piece of paper against the glass. A high school 	diploma. Her face lights up, blinking back tears.  	LOW ANGLE on steel door. Somewhere behind it, unseen, is Andy, 	A rat scurries along the wall. FOOTSTEPS approach slowly.  	Andy listens in darkness. The FOOTSTEPS pause outside his 	door. The slot opens. An ELDERLY GUARD peers in.  		Kid passed. C-plus average. Thought 		you'd like to know. 	The slot closes. The FOOTSTEPS recede. Andy smiles.  	We find Tommy on evening work detail, mopping the floors with 	bucket and pail. Mert Entwhistle comes into view.  		Warden wants to talk.  	A steel door rattles open. Mert leads Tommy outside to a gate, 	unlocks it. Tommy looks around.  		Out here?  		That's what the man said. 	Mert swings the gate open, sends Tommy through, turns and 	heads back inside. Tommy proceeds out across a loading-dock	access for the shops and mills. Some vehicles parked. The 	place is deserted. He stops, sensing a presence.  		Warden? 	Norton steps into the light.  		Tommy, we've got a situation here. 		I think you can appreciate that.  		Yes sir, I sure can.  		I tell you, son, this really came 		along and knocked my wind out. It's 		got me up nights, that's the truth. 	Norton pulls a pack of cigarettes, offers Tommy a smoke. Tommy	takes one. Norton lights both cigarettes, pockets his lighter. 		The right decision. Sometimes it's 		hard to figure out what that is. 		You understand? 			(Tommy nods) 		Think hard, Tommy. If I'm gonna 		move on this, there can't be the 		least little shred of doubt. I have 		to know if you what you told 		Dufresne was the truth.  		Yes sir. Absolutely.  		Would you be willing to swear before 		a judge and jury...having placed 		your hand on the Good Book and taken 		an oath before Almighty God Himself?  		Just gimme that chance.  		That's what I thought. 	Norton drops his cigarette. Crushes it out with the toe of his 	shoe. Glances up toward the plate shop roof as --  	-- a rifle scope pops up into frame, jumping Tommy's image 	into startling magnification, framed in the crosshairs.  	rapid-fires a carbine -- BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!BLAM! -- his face lit 	up by the muzzle flashes. Captain Hadley.  	gets chewed to pieces by the gunfire. He smacks the ground in 	a twitching, thrashing heap. Eyes wide and staring. Dead. 	Surprise still stamped on his face. Silence now. Norton 	turns, strolls into darkness.  	GUARDS approach Andy's cell. The door is unlocked. Andy 	emerges slowly, blinking painfully at the light.  	Andy is marched along. Convicts stop to stare.  	Andy is led in. The door is closed. Alone with Norton. Softly,  		Terrible thing. Man that young, 		less than a year to go, trying to 		escape. Broke Captain Hadley's 		heart to shoot him, truly it did.  		I'm done. It stops right now. Get 		H&R Block to declare your income. 	Norton lunges to his feet, eyes sparkling with rage.  		Nothing stops! NOTHING! 			(tight) 		Or you will do the hardest time 		there is. No more protection from 		the guards. I'll pull you out of 		that one-bunk Hilton and put you in   				NORTON (cont.) 		with the biggest bull queer I can 		find. You'll think you got fucked 		by a train! And the library? Gone! 		Sealed off brick by brick! We'll 		have us a little book-barbecue in 		the yard! They'll see the flames 		for miles! We'll dance around it 		like wild Indians! Do you understand 		me? Are you catching my drift? 	SLOW PUSH IN on Andy's face. Eyes hollow. His beaten 	expression says it all...  	Red finds Andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall, 	poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles. Red 	waits for some acknowledgment. Andy doesn't even look up. 	Red hunkers down and joins him. Nothing is said for the 	longest time. And then, softly:  		My wife used to say I'm a hard man 		to know. Like a closed book. 		Complained about it all the time. 			(pause) 		She was beautiful. I loved her. But 		I guess I couldn't show it enough. 			(softly) 		I killed her, Red. 	Andy finally glances to Red, seeking a reaction. Silence.  		I didn't pull the trigger. But I 		drove her away. That's why she 		died. Because of me, the way I am.  		That don't make you a murderer. Bad 		husband, maybe. 	Andy smiles faintly in spite of himself. Red gives his 	shoulder a squeeze.  		Feel bad about it if you want. But 		you didn't pull the trigger.  		No. I didn't. Someone else did, and 		I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess.  		Bad luck? Jesus.  		It floats around. Has to land on 		somebody. Say a storm comes 		through. Some folks sit in their 		living rooms and enjoy the rain. 		The house next door gets torn out 		of the ground and smashed flat. It 		was my turn, that's all. I was in 		the path of the tornado. 			(softly) 		I just had no idea the storm would 		go on as long as it has. 			(glances to him) 		Think you'll ever get out of here?  		Sure. When I got a long white beard 		and about three marbles left 		rolling around upstairs.  		Tell you where I'd go. Zihuatanejo. 		Zihuatanejo?  		Mexico. Little place right on the 		Pacific. You know what the Mexicans 		say about the Pacific? They say it 		has no memory. That's where I'd 		like to finish out my life, Red. A 		warm place with no memory. Open a 		little hotel right on the beach. 		Buy some worthless old boat and fix 		it up like new. Take my guests out 		charter fishing. 			(beat) 		You know, a place like that, I'd 		need a man who can get things. 	Red stares at Andy, laughs.  		Jesus, Andy. I couldn't hack it on 		the outside. Been in here too long. 		I'm an institutional man now. Like 		old Brooks Hatlen was.  		You underestimate yourself.   		Bullshit. In here I'm the guy who 		can get it for you. Out there, all 		you need are Yellow Pages. I 		wouldn't know where to begin. 			(derisive snort) 		Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare 		me to death, somethin' that big.  		Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and 		I didn't shoot her lover, and 		whatever mistakes I made I've paid 		for and then some. That hotel and 		that boat...I don't think it's too 		much to want. To look at the stars 		just after sunset. Touch the sand. 		Wade in the water. Feel free.  		Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don't do 		that to yourself! Talking shitty 		pipedreams! Mexico's down there, 		and you're in here, and that's the 		way it is!  		You're right. It's down there, and 		I'm in here. I guess it comes down 		to a simple choice, really. Get 		busy living or get busy dying. 	Red snaps a look. What the hell does that mean? Andy rises and	walks away. Red lunges to his feet.  		Andy?  			(turns back) 		Red, if you ever get out of here, 		do me a favor. There's this big 		hayfield up near Buxton. You know 		where Buxton is?  			(nods) 		Lots of hayfields there.  		One in particular. Got a long rock 		wall with a big oak at the north 		end. Like something out of a Robert 		Frost poem. It's where I asked my  				ANDY (cont.) 		wife to marry me. We'd gone for a 		picnic. We made love under that 		tree. I asked and she said yes. 			(beat) 		Promise me, Red. If you ever get 		out, find that spot. In the base of 		that wall you'll find a rock that 		has no earthly business in a Maine 		hayfield. A piece of black volcanic 		glass. You'll find something buried 		under it I want you to have.  		What? What's buried there?  		You'll just have to pry up that 		rock and see. 	Andy turns and walks away.   		I tell you, the man was talkin' 		crazy. I'm worried, I truly am.  		We ought to keep an eye on him.  		That's fine, during the day. But 		at night he's got that cell all to 		himself.  		Oh Lord. Andy come down to the 		loading dock today. Asked me for a 		length of rope. Six foot long.  		Shit! You gave it to him?  		Sure I did. I mean why wouldn't I? 		Christ! Remember Brooks Hatlen?  		How the hell was I s'pose to know?  		Andy'd never do that. Never. 	They all look to Red.  		Every man's got a breaking point.  				VOICE (over P.A.) 		Report to your cellblocks for 		evening count. 	BOOM DOWN to Red and the boys. Convicts drift past them. 		Where the hell is he?  		Probably still up in the warden's.  			(via bullhorn)   		Christ. What do we do?  		Nothing we can do. Not tonight.  		Let's pull him aside tomorrow, all 		of us. Have a word with him. Ain't 		that right, Red?  			(unconvinced) 		Yeah. Sure. That's right.  	Andy's working away. Norton pokes his head in.  		Lickety-split. I wanna get home.  		Just about done, sir. 	We follow Norton to his wife's sampler. He swings it aside, 	works the combination dial, opens the wall safe. Andy moves up,	shoves in the black ledger and files. Norton shuts the safe.  		Three deposits tonight. 	Andy hands him the envelopes. Norton heads for the door.  		Get my stuff down t'laundry. And 		shine my shoes. I want 'em lookin' 		like mirrors. 			(pauses at door) 		Nice havin' you back, Andy. Place 		just wasn't the same without you. 	Norton exits. Andy turns to the laundry. He opens the shoebox. 	Nice pair of dress shoes inside. He sighs, glances down at the 	old ragged pair of work shoes on his own feet.  	Andy is diligently shining Norton's shoes.  	Andy trudges down the hallway, laundry slung over his shoulder,  	Andy nods to the GUARD. The guard BUZZES him through.  	Red hears Andy coming, moves to the bars. He watches Andy come 	up to the second tier and pause before his cell.  		Open number twelve! 	Andy gazes directly at Red. A beat of eye contact. Red shakes 	his head. Don't do it. Andy smiles, eerily calm...and enters 	his cell. The door closes. KA-THUMP! We hold on Red's face.  	Andy is polishing a chess piece.  		Lights out! 	The lights bump off. He finishes polishing, holds up the piece 	to admire. A pawn. He sets it down with the others -- and we 	realize it's the final glance for the board. A full set. 	He gazes up at Racquel and smiles. Pulls a six foot length of 	rope from under his pillow. Lets it uncoil to the floor.  	Red sits in the dark, a bundle of nerves, trying to hold 	himself still. He feels like he might scream or shake to 	pieces. The seconds tick by, each an eternity.  		I have had some long nights in 		stir. Alone in the dark with 		nothing but your thoughts, time can 		draw out like a blade... 	A FLASH OF LIGHTNING outside his window sends harsh barred 	shadows jittering across the cell. A storm breaking.  		That was the longest night of my 		life...  	KA-THUMP! The master lock is thrown. The cons emerge from 	their cells and the headcount begins. Red looks back to see if 	Andy's in line. He's not. Suddenly the count stalls:  		Man missing on tier two! Cell 12! 	The head bull, HAIG, checks his list:  		Dufresne? Get your ass out here, 		boy! You're holding up the show! 			(no answer) 		Don't make me come down there now! 		I'll thump your skull for you! 	Still no answer. Glaring, Haig stalks down the tier, clipboard 	in hand. His men fall in behind.  		Dufresne, dammit, you're putting me 		behind! You better be sick or dead 		in there, I shit you not! 	They arrive at bars. Their faces go slack. Stunned. Softly:  	Oh my Holy God.  	reveals the cell is empty. Everything neat and tidy. Even the 	bunk is stowed. They wrench the door open and rush in, tossing 	the cell in a panic as if Andy might be lurking under the 	Kleenex or the toothpaste. CAMERA ROCKETS IN on Haig as he 	spins toward us, bellowing at the top of his lungs:   	Norton is kicking back with the morning paper. He notices ha	dingy his shoes are. He glances at the shoebox on the desk. 	kicks his shoes off, opens the box -- and gulls out Andy's o	grimy work shoes. He stares blankly. What the fuck indeed. 	An ALARM STARTS BLARING throughout the prison. He looks up.  	Norton and Hadley stride across the grounds, ALARM BLARING.  		I want every man on that cellblock 		questioned! Start with that friend 		of his!  		who?  	Red watches as Norton storms up with an entourage of guards. 		Him. 	Red's eyes widen. Guards yank him from his cell.  	Norton steps to the center of the room, working himself up 	into a fine rage:  		What do you mean ""he just wasn't 		here?"" Don't say that to me, Haig! 		Don't say that to me again!  		But sir! He wasn't! He isn't!  		I can see that, Haig! You think I'm 		blind? Is that what you're saying? 		Am I blind, Haig?  		No sir! 	Norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at Hadley.  		What about you? You blind? Tell me 		what this is!  		Last night's count.  		You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! 		Right there, see? ""Dufresne."" He 		was in his cell at lights out! 		Stands to reason he'd still be here 		this morning! I want him found! Not 		tomorrow, not after breakfast! Now! 	Haig scurries out, gathering men. Norton spins to Red.  		Well?  		Well what?  		I see you two all the time, you're 		thick as thieves, you are! He 		must'a said something!  		No sir, he didn't! 	Norton spreads his arms evangelist-style, spins slowly around. 		Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and 		vanished like a fart in the wind! 		Nothin' left but some damn rocks on 		the windowsill and that cupcake on 		the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she 		knows! What say there, Fuzzy- 		Britches? Feel like talking? Guess 		not. Why should you be different? 	Red exchanges looks with the guards. Even they're nervous. 	Norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill. He hurls them at	the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words: 		It's a conspiracy! (SMASH) That's 		what this is! (SMASH) It's one big 		damn conspiracy! (SMASH) And 		everyone's in on it! (SMASH) 		Including her! 	He sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel. 	No smash. 	It takes a moment for this to sink in. All eyes go to her. The 	rock went through her. There's a small hole in the poster 	where her navel used to be. 	You could hear a pin drop. Norton reaches up, sinks his finger 	into the hole. He keeps pushing...and his entire hand 	disappears into the wall.  	as Norton rips the poster from before our eyes. Stunned faces 	peer in. CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK...to reveal the long 	crumbling tunnel in the wall.  	RORY TREMONT, a guard barely out of his teens, tries not to 	look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest. He's 	getting instructions from six different people at once.  		They got this skinny kid named Rory 		Tremont to go in the hole. He wasn't 		much in the brains department, but 		he possessed the one most important 		qualification for the job... 			(they slap a flashlight 		in his hands) 		...he was willing to go.  	Rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly.  		Probably thought he'd win a Bronze 		Star or something.  	Dark as midnight. Concrete walls rise on both sides. If you 	imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this 	particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark	tangle of pipes between the cellblocks. Rory's appears, shining	his flashlight down the shaft. Somewhere, a rat SQUEAKS.  		It was his third day on the job.  		Warden? There's a space here 		between the walls 'bout three feet 		across! Smells pretty damn bad!  		I don't care what it smells like!  		Go on, boy! We got a hold of you! 	Looking none too happy about it, Rory squeezes from the tunnel 	and dangles into the shaft. He gets lowered, shining his 	light, smothered by darkness. Not having a good time.  		Hoo-whee! Smell's gettin' worse!  		Never mind, I said! Just keep going!  		Smells pretty damn bad, Warden! In 		fact, it smells just like shit. 	His feet touch the ground -- or what he assumed was the 	ground. It's not. In fact, it's just what it smells like. He 	sinks in past his ankles. He slips and sits heavily in it.  		Oh God, that's what it is, it's 		shit. oh my God it's shit. pull me 		out 'fore I blow my groceries, oh 		shit it's shit, oh my Gawwwwwwd!  	Red and others listen to violent barfing from below.  		And then came the unmistakable 		sound of Rory Tremont losing his 		last few meals. The whole cellblock 		heard it. I mean, it echoed. 	That's it for Red. He starts laughing. Laughing, hell, he's 	bellowing laughter, laughing so hard he has to hold himself, 	laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks. The look 	of rage on Norton's face makes him laugh all the harder.  	Abrupt silence. LOW ANGLE on steel door.  		I laughed myself right into 		solitary. Two week stretch.   		It's shit, it's shit, oh my God 		it's shit... 	He starts laughing all over again, fit to split.  		Andy once talked about doing easy 		time in the hole. Now I knew what 		he meant.  	Virgin landscape. Charming rural road. Suddenly, State Police	cruisers rocket up the road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS.  		In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from 		Shawshank Prison.  	Shawshank is half a mile distant. WE TRACK ALONG a muddy creel	as STATE TROOPERS and PRISON GUARDS scour the brush. A TROOPEE	fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick.  		All they found of him was a muddy 		set of prison clothes, a bar of 		soap, and an old rock-hammer damn 		near worn down to the nub. 	TROOPER g2 pulls the rock-hammer from the weeds. SWISH PAN 	to a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER. His FLASHBULB GLARE produces:  	of the hapless cops posing with Andy's reeking uniform and the	worn rock-hammer. PUSH IN on the hammer.  		I remember thinking it would take a 		man six hundred years to tunnel 		through the wall with it. Andy did 		it in less than twenty.  	Once again, we see Andy using the rock-hammer to scratch his	name into the cement. Suddenly, a palm-sized chunk of cement 	pops free and hits the floor. He stares down at it.  	Andy lies in the dark, studying the chunk of concrete in his 	hands. Considering the possibilities. Wrestling with hope.  		Andy loved geology. I imagine it 		appealed to his meticulous nature. 		An ice age here, a million years of 		mountain-building there, plates of 		bedrock grinding against each other 		over a span of millennia...  	Andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen 	chunk. Carefully runs his fingertip over it.  		Geology is the study of pressure 		and time. That's all it takes, 		really. Pressure and time.  	Rita is now on the wall, hanging down over Andy's back.  		That and a big damn poster. 	TRACK IN to reveal Andy scraping patiently at the concrete.  		Like I said. In prison, a man'll do 		most anything to keep his mind 		occupied. 	He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. He smoothes the poster down and 	dives into bed. A GUARD strolls by a moment later, shining his 	flashlight into the cell.  	Andy strolls along, whistling softly, hands in both pockets. 	TILT DOWN to his pantleg. Concrete grit trickles out.  		It turns out Andy's favorite hobby 		was totin' his wall out into the 		exercise yard a handful at a time...  	A GUARD strolls the tier, shining his flashlight into the 	cells. He pauses at Andy's bars, playing the beam over the 	sleeping form huddled under the blankets. 	p37 REVERSE ANGLE (FROM INS1DE ANDY'S CELL) 237	We see what the guard doesn't: instead of Andy's head under 	the blanket, it's a wadded-up pillow. The flashlight plays 	across the cell, pinning Marilyn Monroe in a circle of light.  	The light illuminates her face through the paper. WIDEN to 	reveal Andy lying in his tunnel, holding his breath. The 	light clicks off. The FOOTSTEPS move on. He gets back to work.  		While the rest of us slept, Andy 		spent years workin' the nightshift...  	BOOMING SLOWLY UP the shaft. Rats scurry the pipes. Suddenly, r	piece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets	down the shaft as the rock-hammer pushes through. The pick 	withdraws, replaced by Andy's peering eye. 240 	A SERIES OF DISSOLVES (1965 through 1966) 240	takes us through the widening of the hole. First as big as a 	tea cup. Then a saucer. Then a dinner plate.  		Probably took him most of a year 		just to get his head through. 	Andy finally gets his head through, scraping his ears. He's 	got a penlight clenched in his teeth. He peers down into the 	shaft. At the very bottom, maybe 20 feet down, a big ceramic 	pipe runs the length of the cellblock. Beneath its coat of 	grime and dust, the word ""SEWER"" is stenciled.  	ANGLE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN. Below us, Tommy Williams lies 	facedown at Norton's feet. Blood is spreading, fanning out oa 	the pavement. Norton turns, strolls out of frame.  		I guess after Tommy was killed, 		Andy decided he'd been here just 		about long enough. 	Again we see: Andy working. Norton pokes his head in.  		Lickety-split. I wanna get home.  		Just about done, sir. 	Norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back 	turned. This time, though, we stay on Andy: 	He pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a 	stack of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real 	ledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his 	sweater down. He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, 	and shoves everything in.  	Norton exits his office and strolls off whistling. PUSH IN on 	the open door. We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling 	Norton's dress shoes from their box.  		Andy did like he was told. Buffed 		those shoes to a high mirror shine.  	Andy sorts through Norton's three suits. He pauses, checking 	the gray pinstripe. Nice.  	The guard BUZZES Andy through. Andy walks toward us.  		The guard simply didn't notice. 		Neither did I. I mean, seriously, 		how often do you really look at a 		man's shoes? 	TILT DOWN as he passes by. Yep, he's wearing Norton's shoes.  	The lights go out. Andy places the last chess piece. Gazes up 	at Racquel. Smiles. Pulls the rope from under his pillow. 	He stands and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing Norton's 	gray pinstripe suit underneath. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the 	cell, throwing wild shadows.  	The storm rages. Andy, naked, carefully slips Norton's folded 	suit into a large industrial Zip-Lock bag. Next to go in are the	shoes, chess pieces (already in a smaller bag), black ledger en	files. Last but not least, a bar of soap wrapped in a towel.  	Andy, again wearing prison clothes, inches down the tunnel.  	Andy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist,	He reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel 	conduit with his fingers. 	Suddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. Andy yanks away and 	almost plummets head-first down the shaft. He dangles wildly 	upside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his 	hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. The rat 	scurries off, pissed. 	Andy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and	dangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope: the	plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack,	He kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit3	his back against one wall and feet against the other, he 	starts down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for 	handholds. Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying	in the shadows. He drops the last few feet to the bottom. 	He approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. 	Pulls out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer. 	Raises the rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his 	might. Once, twice -- third time lucky. An enormous eruption 	of sewage cascades into the air as if rocket-propelled, the 	Mount St. Helens of shit. Andy is instantly coated black. He 	turns away and heaves his guts out. The shit keeps coming.  	Andy peers down through the hole, playing his penlight aroun5,	The inside diameter is no more than two feet. Tight squeeze. 	Coated with crud. It seems to go on for miles. 	No turning back. He wriggles into the pipe and starts 	crawling, plastic bag dragging behind.  		Andy crawled to freedom through 		five hundred yards of shit-smelling 		foulness I can't even imagine. Or 		maybe I just don't want to.  	Rain is falling in solid sheets. Shawshank is half a mile 	distant. BOOM DOWN to reveal the creek...and PUSH IN toward the 	mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it.  		Five hundred yards. The length of 		five football fields. Just shy of 		half a mile. 	Fingers appear, thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh 	covering the mouth of the pipe. Andy's face looms from the 	darkness, peering out at freedom. He wrenches the mesh loose, 	pushes himself out, and plunges head-first into the creek. He 	comes up sputtering for breath. The water is waist-deep. 	He wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. He gets 	his shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings 	the shirt away. He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, 	feeling the rain washing him clean. Exultant. Triumphant. A 	FLASH OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon.  	Once again, we see stunned faces as CAMERA PULLS BACK.  		The next morning, right about the 		time Racquel was spilling her 		little secret...  	The door opens. Spit-shined shoes enter. DOLLY the shoes to 	the counter.  		...a man nobody ever laid eyes on 		before strolled into the Casco Bank 		of Portland. Until that moment, he 		didn't exist -- except on paper.  		May I help you? 	TILT UP to Andy. Smiling in Norton's gray pinstripe suit. 		My name is Peter Stevens. I've come 		to close out some accounts.  	The teller is cutting a cashier's check while the MANAGER 	carefully examines Mr. Stevens' various I.D.s.  		He had all the proper I.D. Driver's 		license, birth certificate, social 		security card. The signature was a 		spot-on match.  	I must say I'm sorry to be losing 	your business. I hope you'll enjoy 	living abroad.  		Thank you. I'm sure I will.  		Here's your cashier's check, sir. 		Will there be anything else?  		Please. Would you add this to your 		outgoing mail? 	He hands her a package, stamped and addressed. Gives them a 	pleasant smile. Turns and strolls from the bank.  		Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen 		banks in the Portland area that 		morning. All told, he blew town 		with better than 370 thousand 		dollars of Warden Norton's money. 		Severance pay for nineteen years.  	A MAN in shirtsleeves is going through the mail on his desk. 	He finds Andy's package, rips it open. Pulls out the black 	ledger and files. Scans a cover letter. Holy shit. He dashes 	to his door and yanks it open, revealing the words on the 	glass: ""PORTLAND DAILY BUGLE -- Editor In Chief.""  		Hal! Dave! Get your butts in here!  	Norton walks slowly toward his office. Dazed. The morning 	paper in his hand. He goes wordlessly past the DUTY GUARD into 	his office. Shuts the door. Lays the paper on his desk. 	The headline reads: ""CORRUPTION AND MURDER AT SHAWSHANK."" 	Below that, the sub-headline: ""D.A. Has Ledger. Indictments 	Expected."" Norton looks up as SIRENS SWELL in the distance. 	For the second time, State Police cruisers go rocketing up the	road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS.  	Norton opens his safe and pulls out the ""ledger"" -- it's 	Andy's Bible. The title page is inscribed by hand: ""Dear 	Warden. You were right. Salvation lay within."" Norton flips to	the center of the book -- and finds the pages hollowed out in	the shape of a rock-hammer.  	Police cruisers everywhere. A media circus. REPORTERS jostle	for position. A colorless DISTRICT ATTORNEY steps forward into	CLOSEUP, flanked by a contingent of S.ATE TROOPERS.  		Byron Hadley? 	ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Captain Hadley. Staring. Waiting.  		You have the right to remain 		silent. If you give up that 		right, anything you say will be 		used against you in court... 	TROOPERS move in, cuffing Hadley's hands behind his back. The	D.A. drones on. FLASHBULBS POP. Hadley says nothing. His face	scrunches up. He begins to cry.  		I wasn't there to see it, but I hear 		Byron Hadley was sobbing like a 		little girl when they took him away. 	Hadley sobs all the way to the car. The D.A. snaps a gaze up	toward Norton's window, motions his men to follow.  	Norton is staring out the window as they approach the 	building. He goes to his desk, opens a drawer. Inside lies a	revolver and a box of shells.  		Norton had no intention of goin' 		that quietly.  	The D.A. marches along amidst a phalanx of TROOPERS.  	Norton sits blankly at his desk, revolver before him. The 	doorknob rattles, a VOICE is heard:  		Samuel Norton? We have a warrant 		for your arrest! Open up! 	The POUNDING starts. Norton dumps the box of bullets out on thr	desk. He starts sorting them to see which ones he likes.  	Troopers hustle the hapless duty guard to Norton's door as he	fumbles nervously with a huge key ring.  		I'm not sure which one it is... 	He starts trying keys in the lock. And as the keys go sliding	in one after another...  	...so do the bullets. Norton is riveted to the door. For every	key, he loads another bullet. Methodical and grim. He gets the	final bullet in just as the right key slams home. The door 	bursts open. Men muscle in. Somebody SHOUTS. Troopers dive in	all directions as Norton raises the gun -- 	-- and jams it under his chin. his head snaps back as the wall	goes red. His swivel chair does a slow half-turn and creaks to	a final stop. Troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror.  		I like to think the last thing that 		went through his head...other than 		that bullet...was to wonder how the 		hell Andy Dufresne ever got the 		best of him. 	PUSH SLOWLY to the wall to reveal Mrs. Norton's framed sampler	trickling blood and brains...and we get our final Bible lesson	for today: ""HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON.""  	Mail call. Red hears his name. They pass him a postcard.  		Not long after the warden deprived 		us of his company, I got a postcard 		in the mail. It was blank. But the 		postmark said, ""McNary, Texas.""  	Red sits with an atlas, tracing his finger down the page.  		McNary. Right on the border. That's 		where Andy crossed. 			(shuts the book) 		When I picture him heading south in 		his own car with the top down, it 		makes me laugh all over again...  	A red convertible rips along with Andy at the wheel, cigar 	jutting from his grin, warm wind fluttering his tie.  		Andy Dufresne, who crawled through 		a river of shit and came out clean 		on the other side. Andy Dufresne, 		headed for the Pacific.  	Heywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about Andy.  		Those of us who knew him best talk 		about him often. I swear, the stuff 		he pulled. It always makes us laugh. 	A wild burst of laughter. PUSH IN on Red. Feeling melancholy. 		Sometimes it makes me sad, though, 		Andy being gone. I have to remind 		myself that some birds aren't meant 		to be caged, that's all. Their 		feathers are just too bright...  	Convicts hoe the fields. Guards patrol on horseback.  		...and when they fly away, the part 		of you that knows it was a sin to 		lock them up does rejoice...but still, 		the place you live is that much more 		drab and empty that they're gone. 	A DISTANT RUMBLE OF THUNDER. Red pauses, gazes off. Storm 	clouds coming in, backlit by the sun. A light drizzle begins.  		I guess I just miss my friend.  	Red is sleeping. He wakes with a start.  		But there are times I curse him for 		the dreams he left behind... 	He senses a presence, looks over his shoulder. There's a Rita 	Hayworth poster on his wall. He gets out of bed. Rita just 	keeps smiling, inscrutable. As Red watches, a brilliant 	round glow builds behind the poster, shining from the 	tunnel. The poster rips free, charred to ash in the blink 	of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the 	cell. Sunlight. Red staggers back against the glare. 	A whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air. The 	hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner -- papers, 	book, toiletries, bedding -- if it ain't nailed down, it gets 	sucked down the hole toward the light. Red fights it, but the 	suction drags him closer and closer...  	...and CAMERA rockets into the hole, getting sucked down an 	endless tunnel at impossible speed, the ROAR of air mixing 	with his drawn-out SCREAM, closer and closer to the light... 	...and erupting out the other side into total silence and a 	beautiful white beach. The Pacific Ocean before us. Enormous. 	Mind-blowing. Beautiful beyond description. All we hear now 	are the gentle sound of waves.  		...dreams where I am lost in a warm 		place with no memory. 	A lone figure stands at water's edge. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, 	coming up behind him and TRACKING AROUND to reveal -- Red.  		An ocean so big it strikes me dumb. 		Waves so quiet they strike me deaf. 		Sunshine so bright it strikes me 		blind. It is a place that is blue 		beyond reason. Bluer than can 		possibly exist. Bluer than my mind 		can possibly grasp.  	Nothing for a million miles but beach, sky, and water. Red is 	a tiny speck at water's edge. Just another grain of sand.  		I am terrified. There is no way home.  	Red wakes from the nightmare. He gets out of bed. Moves to the 	barred window of his cell. Peers up at the stars.  		Andy. I know you're in that place. 		Look at the stars for me just after 		sunset. Touch the sand...wade in 		the water...and feel free.   	slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond. 	CAMERA PUSHES through. SIX MEN AND ONE WOMAN sit at a long 	table. An empty chair faces them. We are again in:  	Red enters, sits. 20 years older than when we first saw him. 		Your file says you've served forty 		years of a life sentence. You feel 		you've been rehabilitated? 	Red doesn't answer. Just stares off. Seconds tick by. The 	parole board exchanges glances. Somebody clears his throat.  		Shall I repeat the question?  		I heard you. Rehabilitated. Let's 		see now. You know, come to think of 		it, I have no idea what that means.  		Well, it means you're ready to 		rejoin society as a--  		I know what you think it means. Me, 		I think it's a made-up word, a poli- 		tician's word. A word so young fellas 		like you can wear a suit and tie and 		have a job. What do you really want 		to know? Am I sorry for what I did?  				MAN g2 		Well...are you?  		Not a day goes by I don't feel 		regret, and not because I'm in here 		or because you think I should. I 		look back on myself the way I 		was...stupid kid who did that 		terrible crime...wish I could talk 		sense to him. Tell him how things 		are. But I can't. That kid's long 		gone, this old man is all that's 		left, and I have to live with that. 			(beat) 		Rehabilitated? That's a bullshit 		word, so you just go on ahead and 		stamp that form there, sonny, and 		stop wasting my damn time. Truth 		is, I don't give a shit. 	The parole board just stares. Red sits drumming his fingers.  	A big rubber stamp SLAMS down -- and lifts away to reveal the 	word ""APPROVED"" in red ink.  	TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the main gate. It 	swings hugely open, revealing Red standing in his cheap suit, 	carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. He walks out, still 	looking stunned.  	Red rides the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by 	terror of speed and motion.  	Red arrives at the Brewster, three stories high and even less 	to look at than it used to be.  	A BLACK WOMAN leads Red up the stairs toward the top floor.  	Small, old, dingy. An arched window with a view of Congress	Street. Traffic noise floats up. Red enters and pauses, 	staring up at the ceiling beam. Carved into the wood are the	words: ""Brooks Hatlen was here.""  	Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. We find Red bagging 	groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. Red 	calls to the STORE MANAGER:  		Sir? Restroom break sir?  			(motions him over) 		You don't need to ask me every 		time you go take a piss. Just go. 		Understand? 28l	INT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 281	Red steps to the urinal, stares at himself in the wall mirror.  		Thirty years I've been asking 		permission to piss. I can't squeeze 		a drop without say-so. 	A strange east Indian guitar-whine begins. The Beatles. George 	Harrison's ""Within You Without You...""  	...which carries through as Red walks. People and traffic. He 	keeps looking at the women. An alien species.  		Women, too, that's the other thing. 		I forgot they were half the human 		race. There's women everywhere, 		every shape and size. I find myself 		semi-hard most of the time, cursing 		myself for a dirty old man. 	TWO YOUNG WOMEN stroll by in cut-offs and t-shirts.  		Not a brassiere to be seen, nipples 		poking out at the world. Jeezus, 		pleeze-us. Back in my day, a woman 		out in public like that would have 		been arrested and given a sanity 		hearing.  	Red finds the park filled with HIPPIES. Hanging out. 	Happening. Here's the source of the music: a radio. A HIPPIE 	GIRL gyrates to the Beatles, stoned, in her own world.  		They're calling this the Summer of 		Love. Summer of Loonies, you ask me.  	Red sits across from his PAROLE OFFICER. The P.O. is filling	out his report.  		You staying out of the bars, Red?  		Yes sir. That I am.  		How you doing otherwise? Adjusting 		okay?  		Things got different out here.  		Tell me about it. Young punks 		protesting the war. You imagine? 		Even my own kid. Oughtta bust his 		fuckin' skull.  		Guess the world moved on.  	Bagging groceries. CHILDREN underfoot. One points a toy gun at	Red, pumping the trigger. Red focuses on the gun, listening to	it CLICKETY-CLACK. Sparky wheel grinding. 	The kids get swept off by MOM. Red starts bagging the next 	customer. SLOW PUSH IN on Red. Surrounded by MOTION and NOISE.	Feeling like the eye of a hurricane. People everywhere, 	whipping around him like a gale. Strange. Loud. Dizzying. It	gets distorted and weird, slow and thick, pressing in on him	from all sides. The noise level intensifies. The hollering of	children deepens and distends into LOW EERIE HOWLS. 	He's in the grip of a major anxiety attack. Tries to shake	himself out of it. Can't. Fumbles the final items into the	bag. Walks away. Trying not to panic. Trying not to run. 	He makes his way through the store. Blinking sweat. He bumps	into a lady's cart, mumbles an apology, keeps going. Breaks 	into a trot. Down the aisle, cut to the left, through the door	into the back rooms, faster and faster, running now, slamming	through a door marked ""Employees Only"" into --  	-- where he slams the door and leans heavily against it, 	shutting everything out, breathing heavily. Alone now. 	He goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down. 	He can still hear them out there. They won't go away. He 	glances around the restroom. Small. Not small enough. 	He enters a stall. Locks the door. Puts the toilet lid down 	and sits on the john. Better. He can actually reach out and 	touch the walls now. They're close. Safe. Almost small enough. 	He draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in. 	He'll just sit here for a while. Until he calms down.  	Red is walking home.  		There is a harsh truth to face. 		No way I'm gonna make it on the 		outside. 	He pauses at a pawnshop window. An array of handguns.  		All I do anymore is think of ways 		to break my parole. 	The SHOPKEEPER appears at the glass, locking the door and 	flipping the sign: CLOSED.  	Red lies smoking in bed. Unable to sleep.  		Terrible thing, to live in fear. 		Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all 		too well. All I want is to be back 		where things make sense. Where I 		won't have to be afraid all the time. 	He glances up at the ceiling beam. ""Brooks Hatlen was here.""  		Only one thing stops me. A promise 		I made to Andy.  	A pickup truck rattles up the road trailing dust and pulls to 	a stop. Red hops off the back, waves his thanks. The truck 	drives on. Red starts walking. PAN TO a roadside sign: BUXTON.  	High white clouds in a blazing blue sky. The trees fiery with 	autumn color. Red walks the fields and back-roads, cheap 	compass in hand. Looking for a certain hayfield.  	Walking. Searching. The day turning late. Red finds himself 	staring at a distant field. There's a long rock wall, like 	something out o f a Robert Frost poem. Big oak tree. Red checks 	his compass. North end. He crosses a dirt road into the field.  	Red walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree. A squirrel 	scolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher. Red studies	the base of the wall. Nothing unusual here. Just a bunch of	rocks set in stone. He sighs. Fool's errand. Turns to go. 	Something catches his eye. He walks back, squats, peering 	closer. Wets a fingertip and rubs a stone. A layer of dust comes 	off. Volcanic glass. Gleaming black. He tries to get the rock 	out, anticipation growing. It won't come; it's too smooth. He 	pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free. It tumbles at his 	feet, leaving a ragged hole. 	Red leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the 	object buried under the rock. Stunned. It's an envelope wrapped 	in plastic. Written on it is a single word: ""Red."" 	Red pulls the envelope out and rises. He just stares at it for 	a while, almost afraid to open it. But open it he does. Inside 	is a smaller envelope and a letter. Red begins to read:  		Dear Red. If you're reading this, 		you've gotten out. And if you've 		come this far, maybe you're willing 		to come a little further. You 		remember the name of the town, 		don't you? I could use a good man 		to help me get my project on 		wheels. I'll keep an eye out for 		you and the chessboard ready. 			(beat) 		Remember, Red. Hope is a good 		thing, maybe the best of things, 		and no good thing ever dies. I will 		be hoping that this letter finds 		you, and finds you well. Your 		friend. Andy. 	By now, tears are spilling silently down Red's cheeks. He 	opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty- 	dollar bills. Twenty of them. A thousand dollars.  	Red is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, puts 	his hat on. His bag is by the door. He takes one last look 	around. Only one thing left to do. He pulls a wooden chair to 	the center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam.  		Get busy living or get busy dying. 		That is goddamn right. 	He steps up on the chair. It wobbles under his weight.  	The door opens. Red exits with his bag and heads down the 	stairs, leaving the door open. CAMERA PUSHES through, BOOMING 	UP to the ceiling beam which reads: ""Brooks Hatlen was here."" 	A new message has been carved alongside the old: ""So was Red.""  	TRACKING SHOT reveals a long line of people at the counter.  		For the second time in my life, I 		am guilty of committing a crime. 	CAMERA brings us to Red, next in line, bag by his feet.  		Parole violation. I doubt they'll 		toss up any roadblocks for that. 		Not for an old crook like me.  			(steps up) 		McNary, Texas?  	A gorgeous New England landscape whizzes by, fields and trees 	a blur of motion. ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal a Greyhound Sceni- 	Cruiser barreling up the road, pulling abreast of us. CAMERA 	TRAVELS from window to window, passing faces. We finally come 	to Red gazing out at the passing landscape.  		I find I am so excited I can barely 		sit still or hold a thought in my 		head. I think it is the excitement 		only a free man can feel, a free 		man at the start of a long journey 		whose conclusion is uncertain...  	ROARS past camera, dwindling to a mere speck on the horizon.  		I hope I can make it across the 		border. I hope to see my friend 		and shake his hand. I hope the 		Pacific is as blue as it has been 		in my dreams. 			(beat) 		I hope.  	A distant boat lies on its side in the sand like an old wreck 	that's been left to rot in the sun. There's someone out there.  	A MAN is meticulously stripping the old paint and varnish by 	hand, face hidden with goggles and kerchief mask. 	Red appears b.g., a distant figure walking out across the 	sand, wearing his cheap suit and carrying his cheap bag. 	The man on the boat pauses. Turns slowly around. Red arrives 	with a smile as wide as the horizon. The other man raises his 	goggles and pulls down his mask. Andy, of course.  		You look like a man who knows how 		to get things.  		I'm known to locate certain things 		from time to time. 	Red shrugs off his jacket and picks up a sander.

"                                    Written by                                Annie Mumolo                                                                                                                Annie is in nice lingerie, happily getting ready for the          day. She puts a lot of effort into her appearance.          Products everywhere, too many hair-flips, eye-cream, no          hair out of place.          She walks into the bedroom, where TED, a gorgeous man          sleeps. She sneaks back into the bed, carefully          positioning herself and moving the sheets to show her          good parts.          She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend          sleeps.           Good morning.          Annie pretends to wake up.           Wow, you look beautiful.            What? No. I don't. Oh my God its the          morning. I look terrible. I just woke up.           Last night was fun.           Yeah, I had the best time. I have't had          that much fun on a first date in years,          ever...          She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her          long time lover.           So listen Annie, I like you. So, I want          to be up front with you. I'm not really          looking for a relationship right now.          Annie's eyes grow large. She uncomfortably smiles at him,          nodding.           Oooooo. Oops. I mean, yeah. What?           I just want to be honest right off the          bat.                                                                                                                Yeah, yeah. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. I love that.          Annie struggles to maintain her composure.           I'm just so busy and I don't have time          for another person...I...           Yeah, me too, I'm soo busy--           And summer's coming--           Yeah, summer, exactly. It's a crazy          season. So you just wanna give me a call          in the fall or--?           Yeah, I'm not gonna be in town much even          in the fall--           You shouldn't be! Yeah, Halloween--           I'm gonna be travelling a lot for work.           Me too, I'm just- so many business trips          to places that are just far away‘cause          I'm doing really well at work.           And honestly, (sits up) I don't even know          how I feel about the whole monogamy          thing, is one person really enough for          anyone? I mean, I like to be with a lot          of different people.           It is sooo refreshing to hear you say          that, because isn't that what everyone          thinks but is afraid to say? I mean, i's          science. I'm-I don't want a relationship          either. Let's just say that. And I          wouldn't even care whatever you do or I          do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like          no strings attached at all. I'm just          different from other girls.                                                                                                                Yeah. Well anyway, I really should get          going. I was gonna get a haircut today.           Yeah, they say that every couple months          it's good to trim the ends, you know, get          all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool. 've          cut hair before.          He waits, but Annie doesn't budge.           Well, like I said I got stuff to do.          Annie notices a picture of a sailboat above the bed.           Yeah, me too. Gonna try to get some          sailing in before the weather gets          crazy...           Cool, well I don't wanna be Get up the jib..          late.          Ted gets up. Awkward moment leading into...            Oh, and thanks for the lemon bars.           Oh, no problem. Made from scratch.           Annie stands at the closed driveway gate waiting as Ted          repeatedly presses the button. She smiles at a neighbor.           Sometimes it sticks!           No, I love it!          The gate starts to open. Annie exits.           Byyyyee!                                                                                                                Annie sits in her old shitty car. She lets out an          exasperated sigh, then sees the clock.           Oh, shit.          The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away.           Annie gets out her phone and speed dials LILLIAN.           Lillian is getting dressed. Upscale, professional          clothes.           It's summer?! What the hell does that          mean? He can't date anyone in the summer?           I guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid          now.           No he's stupid Ann, not you.           I think I might be a little bit stupid.           Ew. Did you have sex with him?           No! But I gave him a blow job.           What?!           Well, he kept putting it in my face.          Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a          Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his          muscles trying to make her laugh.                                                                                                                Well, at least he was honest with you so          you don't waste your time with him.           Baby, look how hard I worked out. Look at          all this sweat.           Can you see that I'm on the phone? I'm          talking to Annie.           Hey Annie.           Are you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for          women you know?           Shit. Really?!           It's not gonna do anything to you.           Oh my God. My breasts are getting bigger.          He tries to rub up against Lillian.           Ew, go take a shower.          Dougie leaves.           I'm gonna play with my new boobs in          there.           I swear I cannot handle him right now. He          has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it          feels like I'm kissing my brother. I          don't know what do.          Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY          STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in the          car. A white blouse and navy skirt.           At least you have someone. God, wha's          wrong with me?                                                                                                                There's nothing wrong with you. But I          think maybe, and don't get mad at me,          I've said this to you before, you need to          stop trying so hard.           I still don't think I do that.           OK, so you had a first date last night.          Did you bring him a present?          Annie is silent.           Ann, what did I tell you?           I brought him lemon-bars because I was          making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're          right, that's weird.           Shit!           What?!           I just chipped a nail!           Ok, I don't know if it's because I'm          tired or what, but I wanna kill him.           Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the          mirror and remember when I was getting my          braces off and farted at the          orthodontist.          Lillian laughs.           Oh my God. We need to hang out. 'm          coming to Milwaukee this weekend.           Are you serious?                                                                                                                We'll go to Joni's and pig out and I'll          bring some shitty magazines, and I'm          gonna spend the night.           God, I haven't seen you in months!           I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.          They hang up. Dougie is in the doorway wearing her          nightie stretched over his body.           Baby, I'm going through some changes...           (laughing) You're an idiot.          We see she gets a kick out of him.           Annie enters hurriedly pulling her hair into a bun.           Hi. Sorry, sorry! I'm here. I'm here.           (quickly) Annie! Thank God. OK people!          Gather around me please, in a tight          semicircle.          Annie and six other employees gather around DONNA.           (slightly overdramatic) Something          terrible has happened. Donald will not          be coming in to work today. He stepped          on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable          swelling.          Employees mumble.           Annie? Where's your tie?          Everyone looks at Annie. She holds it up and starts to          put it on.                                                                                                                Now, I have an eye doctor's appointment          that I can't change or they'll will          charge me. So someone will have to cover          for Donald in engagement rings. Now I--          Annie and SANDY, a male co-worker, shoot their hands the          air eagerly.           Sandy? Today's your day.           Ooh, my horoscope said I would be          presented with an opportunity at work          today. That is eerie. That is eerie.           Annie, that means you'll be alone in          keepsakes. You think you can handle it?           Yeah, look out. There might be a bum-          rush for letter openers...          The employees snicker.           Sometimes there is, so....there have          been. At times, there has been.           Alright everybody, let's get to work!          Saneel?!...OPEN SESAME!          SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks          the doors. Everyone goes to work. Donna gathers her          things and starts walking towards the exit with Annie          tailing behind her.           Donna, can I talk to you for a second? I          feel like if you gave me a shot at          engagement rings sometime, I could really-           Annie, what is the calibration of a 2          carat diamond in a standard English          setting?           Five?                                                                                                                I just made all of that up. None of that          was real. I just put words together.          You're not ready for the big leagues.          Understand?           It's so hard to make commission over          there.           Sweetheart...did I ever tell you the          story of the little paralyzed Chinese          girl who wanted to be dancer?           Many times.           She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling          in her legs, and then one day after years          of believing in herself, she stood up out          of that chair and tap-danced for the          king. On his birthday! My point is, Sandy          makes a real effort around here. He          connects with the customer. And when he          wants to make a sale, he goes for it.           Okay. (beat) I do want it.           (smiling) Good. Showing up on time is a          wonderful place to start.          Donna talks to herself and gathers her things.           Uhh! A wasp! Who walks around even their          own backyard without at least a thin          sandal. It's reckless!          Donna exits. A customer passes Anni's section.           Hello, can I interest you in a sterling          silver money clip that will create          memories for you and your family? No?          We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V.                                                                                                                When Dave and Rhonda bought this house,          it was a medical clinic. I've never seen          so many cupboards!           STEVE, Annie's mid-thirties roommate, sits on the couch          shirtless and is enthralled by the show.           Noooo. That's, that's sooo smart.          Annie enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys          down and sifts through her mail. Steve presses mute.           There you are, you stayer-out-all-          nighter. Did you make out? Sleep over?          As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her          room.           Don't go in the bathroom. Are you going          to bed?           Yes. I'm beat.           Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did          what you said and just threw it away.           Thanks. Goodnight Steve!          She shuts the door behind her.           That credit lady called! She wants to          talk to you, Annie! She's gonna find you.          Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes the T.V..           This is where they bagged the animals          that didn't make it through the testing.          We turned it into a cozy Moroccan reading          room.                                                                                                                Gross/Amazing.           She sits on her bed grabs a “Sounds to Relax” CD with a          post-it that reads, “Love, Mom”. She plays it and lies          down. We hear a loud Tibetan woma's voice wailing. NOT          relaxing. She turns it off and curls up on top of her          bed.           Annie and Lillian read magazines.           You're right. God, she's getting really          skinny.           Ann.           What?           (quietly) Your boyfriend just walked in.          REVEAL: An orange-skinned BODY BUILDER with HUGE arms and          legs in a tiny muscle tank and shorts.           Oh my God! Look, he showed up with your          mom.          It's a short grey-haired OUTDOORSEY WOMAN in hiking          boots. They laugh to themselves. Annie keeps reading.           Cool! They're making a WKRP movie.           Here Annie, let me turn the page for you.           What?          Lillian splays her hand over the magazine showing off a          sparkling DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.                                                                                                                (playfully) I just want to help you turn          the page of your magazine for you...           Lillian! What is that?!           I'm engaged.           What?!!           He proposed at dinner last night. I          wanted to tell you in person and show you          this rock!           It's beautiful. Lillian. Oh my God, this          is...this is crazy!           I know Dougie and I have been fighting a          lot, but I've been so stressed out with            That's not I mean. I mean, I remember          when we met him at Lake Mills. You lost          your virginity to him right in front of          me on the dock, remember?           Oh you want to get into who's done what          down at the lake?           No, I don't. It's just making me realize          how long we've known each other.           Well then, who better to be my Maid of          Honor?           Oh my God! I don't know what to say!           Annie, you're my best friend. Honestly I          didn't even have to think about it.                                                                                                                Uh, wow. Yes! Of course! Yes! My God.          I've never been in a wedding.           It's no big deal, and I don't want to          make it one. It's not gonna be a big          crazy thing. I wanna keep it simple.          (beat) What dessert are you gonna get?           I know what you're doing. Don't downplay          this. I'm happy for you. And someday when          hell freezes over and I get married, you          can be my Maid of Honor. But for right          now, this is about you. OK? This is          you're day, and it is a big deal.           Ok, but I still don't want this to be a          huge production. I just want to have all          my friends meet each other, have fun,          dance, drink, whatever.           Then that's what it'll be. Did you guys          set a date?           Oh God, not yet. I don't want a super          long engagement, but there's a lot to do.           Well you are very fortunate because you          happen have the best maid of honor in the          whole wide world, and--          Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles.           (mocking) Can you hold that thought. I's          my fiancee calling.          Lillian gets up laughing. Annie laughs along with her.           Ooo, haha...          Annie continues laughing alone. She looks around the room          as her smile disappears. She remembers...                                                                                                                 Annie and Lillian at 7 years old standing outside eating          popsicles, smiling.           Lillian Marie Donovan. Do you take your          husband, forever, to be your husband?          Lillian stands by a poster of Eric Estrada in his          C.H.I.P.s uniform that is taped to a tree.           I do. Do you Annie Lucille Walker, take          your husband, forever?          Reveal Annie standing next to a poster of John Baker from          Chips.           I do.           And now we will leave on our honeymoon          to...            The girls rip the posters off of the trees.          An old station wagon sits in the dirt driveway. They get          in the back seat, look straight ahead and just sit there.            thought.           The madness has begun. Dougie's parents          are having an engagement party for us          next Friday.           Awesome!...                                                                                                                Annie, in her jogging clothes, reaches for a wedding          magazine, but a woman's magazine catches her eye. It            (looking around) Ooh, what's this...          She finds the article. “Hurry, before he gets away! Top          five ways to reel him in.”           Excuse me.          A HOT ATHLETIC GUY with his golden retriever is reaching          for a magazine. She can't thing of what to say. She          remembers the magazine! It reads “#1. A simple, flirty            working! Her cell phone rings, she tries to ignore it,          but it keeps ringing...           Hello?           Annie!?           Yes?          It's HELEN (early 30's) Lillian's bridesmaid and friend          from the tennis Club. She's a tall leggy blond, all          smiles. East coast pretty with a lot of cream cashmere          turtleneck sweaters in her closet. She is sitting in a          cream colored living room on a huge cream couch with lots          of candles glowing.            Hi.           Hi.           Hiiii! This is Helen. I'm one of          Lillian's bridesmaids.                                                                                                                Of course, Helen. Hi!           Congratulations on being selected.           Oh, thank you.          Annie, reads “#2. Expose your best asset. ASAP” She          panics, starts to elongate her right leg, points her toe,          flexes her leg, flips her hair. He seems confused but          politely smiles and goes back to his magazine.           Annie?           Sorry, yes. Hi!           Maid of Honor!!           Yeah. It is quite an honor.           It's the number one spot. So how many          times have you been in the B.P?           I'm sorry, the what?           Bridal Party?           I've never even been in a wedding before.           What!? I've never even heard of that.           Um, well, it should be fun.          Annie sees that the hot guy is leaving to pay for his          magazine! She reads“#5. Make a funny observational joke          that pertains to HIM. (ya know, LIKE SEINFELD!!] Men LOVE           and the golden retriever meet eyes.           Um Helen, can you hold on for a second?                                                                                                                 Annie covers the phone and approaches the hot guy.           Hey, you're dog's really cute.           Oh thanks.           It's kinda funny right? That when girls          are ugly, they're called dogs, but dogs          are cute.          Annie laughs. He half smiles but does not respond.           (beat) Well, some dogs are ugly. Some          girls are ugly. I know a lot of ugly          girls. But I'm not friends with them.          I've seen a lot of ugly dogs too. But          some people I know who are considered          dogs, you know, they have a good          personality, and are better looking to          people cuz of that. And people who are          not nice...that's ugly to me. And female          dogs are called bitches, that's weird.          I'm just kidding. It's a joke. I have          better ones.          The guy leaves. She hears a voice coming from her phone.           Hello?!           Helen! Sorry. Yeah um, I'm really excited          for all the wedding stuff and--           YAY!

Annie gets ready as she talks on speaker phone.           He probably didn't see you, Mom.            Annie's mom, JUDY, (50's) is on the phone while painting          a very lifelike portrait of Wynona Judd from a photograph          that's pinned to it's corner.           Oh, he saw me alright. He was married to          me for fourteen years, he knows what I          look like. I'm sure it was because BARB          was there. You know how jealous she gets.           Yeah, I'm sure that's it mom.           Am I on speaker phone?           Yeah.           I don't know how to talk this way.           Mom I'm running a little late so--           Oh, the engagement party. Lillia's          getting married, I can't believe how time          flies. You're day will come dear.          Give Lillian a kiss for me please, and          tell Laurie and Ed I just could't afford          the plane ticket, but I will be at the          shower.           I already told them, they understand.                                                                                                                BARB could afford to come. Did you know          what kind of car she drives now? A 2007          P.T. Cruiser. She looks ridiculous          parading all around Fort Myers in that          thing.           Ok, Mom--           I don't know how she gets in and out of          that little car with those big legs.           I should get going. I have long drive.           Oh and honey, I picked you up a couple of          things when I was at the Steinmart with          Janice so look for a package in the mail.           Mom I told you you don't have to send me--           Oh stop. I love doing it. Ok? I love you          sweetie.           I love you too Mom. Bye.          They hang up. Annie walks to the kitchen.           Ok, how do I look?           Ooooh. You tryin to hook up tonight? A          lot of people do at these wedding things          you know so you have a good chance.           Nevermind...           I like the black tights with the black          shoes, it's very elongating.           Oh. Well, thank you.                                                                                                                But I think you need more dark up top to          balance it out, do have any black beads?           (looking at herself] That's actually a          good idea.          She starts to leave but sees a guilty look and some          frosting on Steve's face. She looks over at her saran-          's.           How many moonpies have you eaten? Tell me          the truth.           Um......two.           Ok, now really tell me the truth. How          many did you eat?           Four. Nine.          They stare at each other.           Annie is finally driving along. she hears sirens.           Shit!          She pulls over. OFFICER RHODES approaches, chewing gum.           Good afternoon ma'am, You in a hurry to          get out of the city?           No. Was I speeding?           Is that even possible in this rig?          He finds this funny, Annie does't.           You know funny thing about brake lights,          you're supposed to have ‘em.                                                                                                                Ooooh. Yeah. Mine are out.           Yeah, and you're headin' up Witches          Curve. That's a risky move.           I'm sorry. I usually only drive in the          city and they've never pulled me over. To          tell you the truth, those lights have          been out for like a year.           Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy hot-dogger. That          is not something you wanna go          broadcasting to a police officer. I might          feel obligated to give you a yea's worth          of tickets now.           What? No.. I-           You just admitted it.           Can you do that?           You admitted it. (beat) Yeah, I can't do          that though.           Look, I'm really sorry. I promise I will          get the lights fixed tomorrow morning.          I'm kind of in a hurry. I'm going to my          best friend's engagement party, I'm the          Maid of honor and so I really -           Oh, yeah. My little sister was just in a          wedding. She lost some of her hair from          the stress.          Again, not funny.           Am I getting a ticket?          He searches for words. She's cute and he wants to keep          her there. He keeps smiling. Awkward silence.                                                                                                                Uh, yeah. That's what happens when you          break the law. Um...license and          registration.           Here.          He writes a ticket.           (searching for words) Ooo, I like that          air freshener. Did you get that at the          gas station?           I don't remember.           Smells like Christmas. (sniff) Yeah, it          smells like Christmas.          He rips the ticket off.           Well, here you go. And just so you know          it's a just a fix-it ticket. So if you          get those lights repaired, you wo't have          to pay anything.           Oh, Okay.           Whoa, are those moon-pies?           Oh yeah.           (mumbling) Oh, those are my favorite.           What?           Nothing. (mumbling) Those are my          favorite.           Do you want one?                                                                                                                No. It's too much trouble, they look all          wrapped up.          She doesn't get the hint. He really wants one.           Well, have fun at your party.          Annie drives off. He watches.           Annie, a little embarrassed, hands her keys to the valet          and grabs the moon-pies. She walks into an elegant          country club dining room, lively cocktail party. Music,          happy people, etc. She is greeted by Lillia's mom,            Annie, sweetheart!           Hi Mrs. Donovan!          They hug.           Oh! And you brought your famous moonpies!          Laurie takes the tray.           Can you believe our Lillian?           I know, I'm so happy for her.           Well, clue me in. Is there anyone          special in your life?           Nope.           That's my girl. (whisper) Sleep around.          I'm serious. Travel the world and try all          the cuisine you can. You know what I mean          by that, right?          MARY, Laurie's friend, approaches.                                                                                                                Laurie, where did you get that sweater?          It is one-hundred percent out-of-sight!           Shhh, I got it at Glory Gay's.           Ooooh. I can't even walk in there. The          blouses alone make my wallet open.           It's worth it, though huh? Mary, I want          you to meet Lillian's Maid of Honor.           Oh, very special job.           This is Annie Walker. She lived next door          to us in Milwaukee until the girls          graduated from high school.           Hi.           Ann!           Lil! It was nice meeting you Mary.          Annie leaves.           Her father ran off to Florida with a          younger woman who was working at a          Chrysler dealership.           Oh my.           Poor Judy, never quite got over it. She          also ended up moving to Florida to take          care of her parents.           Oh, that is tough. Well it's nice Annie          and Lillian have stayed friends.           They're like sisters.                                                                                                               They continue gabbing as Annie rushes to Lillian. They          hug.           Hey!           Hey! What's up? Where's Dougie?           Smoking a cigar with my dad. Le's go          get a drink.          They weave towards the bar.           Annie!!!           Hold on Dougie, we're getting drinks!          They get to the bar and grab glasses of wine.           This place is so fancy. Dougie's parents          belong here?           Yeah. So does Dougie. This is the tennis          club I've been playing at.           Oh. Wow. I guess it's not what I          pictured. Lucky you.           Tennis courts are tennis courts if you          ask me. But I have met a lot of really          cool people here. I can't wait for you to          meet the girls.           Oh! So where's this guy you were telling          me about?           Oh shoot, Matt's not coming. I guess he          got back together with his ex or          something. Anyway, Dougie just told me.          Sorry.           That's ok.                                                                                                                There she is!          Dougie picks Annie up and swings her around.           Dougie, be careful. God, you reek!          He puts her down.           Annie, make sure when my fiance gets cold          feet you tell her what a great guy I am.          He grabs Lillian and kisses her on the cheek.           (waving the cigar scent away) Ugh. Wash          your face.          She gives in and kisses him. Then says to Annie..           Come on. Let's go say hi to the rest of          the bridal party.          They approach LESLIE, Lillian's cousin, late 30's,          standing with her husband PAUL.           Leslie, hi! How are you guys?           Well, I just squeezed my third kid out          last month and I feel like I'm walking          around in a fat suit.          She swigs beer out of a bottle.           I keep telling her she looks great.          (beat) Oh, I'm sorry. Is this your          boyfriend?          A 30 YEAR OLD AVERAGE GUY with a neckbrace stands behind          Annie. Paul goes to shake his hand. She stops him.           No, no. (to the guy) Hi. (to them) No.          Annie meets DANA who is with her husband Ernie.                                                                                                                Annie this is Dana, we met here in my          tennis class. Dana, Annie.           Hi! Dana Shig. Its so nice to finally          meet you Annie. I've heard so much about          you. This is my husband Ernie.          ERNIE has just put food in his mouth.           Don't you just love weddings? I mean,          (she starts to cry) I just love like the          feeling and...everyone comes together you          know? And it's forever! It's a journey,          and WE get to go on it too!           Wow, that's beautiful. I never thought of          it that way.           This is all so amazing. I'm going to make          a scrap book for Lillian.          Dana takes her camera out then reaches out her hand.           Hi. I'm Dana and this is my husband          Ernie. So...how did you two meet?          She refers to a bald man who looks like a chemistry          teacher, who is slowly walking by looking for someone.           No, I don't know him. He's not with me.          He's just passing by. I'm not here with          anyone.          BECCA stands very close to her husband KEVIN, a good          looking stockbroker type.           Lil! Is this Annie?!          Annie and Lillian walk over.           Hi Annie! I'm Becca. I've heard so much          about you. This is my husband Kevin.                                                                                                                Dougie's partner.           So, are you so excited?! All of this          reminds me so much of my wedding.             Two months now! It was the best day of my          life. I'm married now! It's like...I'm          just better now! It might sound weird          but... I feel legit. Just like, feminine.          Look at my nails!          Two beautifully french manicured hands with a HUGE 3          carat diamond ring.           Ooooops, where are my manners. Hi! I'm          Becca Whitman.          REVEAL a very smart looking, older African-American MAN          standing next to Annie. He is wearing an ascot and          smoking a pipe.           The name's Captain Arnold Dubois.          MEGAN is Dougie's sister. An ODDBALL. She looks like she          might be at the wrong party. She is single and lovin' it!           Annie! Hey! What's up?           Megan! How are you?           I just got pins in my leg! I fell off a          cruise ship.           Oh shit!           Yeah. I was on a singles cruise. It was          nighttime.                                                                                                                 I was port-side, having a drink with a          gentlemen and old Megan here decided to          show off and I tried to climb into one of          the lifeboats with my clogs on. I saw a          dolphin.           Wow. Well, I'm glad you're OK.           Listen Annie. You're single right? You          and I are gonna scam on guys this whole          time. You and I are gonna party and get          naked with guys. This whole time Annie,          no bailing.          Lillian re-appears, grabs Annie.           Ann, there you are!           Think about what I said Annie!           (to Annie) I'm saving you. Now I really          want to introduce you to Helen. looking          around) There she is.          In slow motion, a tall and gorgeous HELEN turns to us.          She wears a tight, cream-colored, floor-length evening          gown. Annie straightens her plastic beads.           Helen, this is Annie.           Hiii.           Hi.           Hiii. This is my husband Perry.           Perry owns Atmospheria candles.           Oh, the Starbuck's of the candle world?

Listen Annie,I know you          said you've never been in a wedding          before so I just want you to know that we          all have, especially me, so if you need          any help, don't hesitate to ask.           Thank you.           Groomsman DEAN finishes a speech. They are now in the          dining room.           So cheers to you two, our last single          friends finally crossing over into the          world of marital bliss, welcome to the          other side!          Dana snaps a photo, crying. Helen approaches the podium.           Hello everyone. My name is Helen Harris          the Third, an honored member of the          bridal party. In honor of Lillian and          Dougie, I'd like to take this opportunity          to read a poem that I penned last summer          while I was sitting on a swing at an          exclusive resort in Santorini.          Annie whispers to the person next to her.           Am I supposed to give a speech?          As Helen reads, Annie looks around the room and sees          everyone in awe. Dana starts to cry. She reads from a          fancy sheet of stationary.           With every blink of an eye, every kiss of          a lip, every stroke of a lovers hand,          every...scent of a woman, every breath          you take, every move you make. Love          conquers all.          Annie sees that Lillian is touched. Helen gets emotional.                                                                                                                They say when you choose a mate, yo're          choosing a best friend. Dougie, yo're a          lucky man. Lillian, I know you're going          to make a wonderful wife, because you          have been the best friend that I could          ever ask for.          Annie's face goes blank.           I have never had a friendship like this.          I'm so happy you two are finally taking          this big step together and I ca't wait          for all of the adventures that await us.          People are moved, sniffling. Including Lillian.           Now “Dougly”, sorry, inside joke. You          better not keep my Lil on a leash. I          still need my drunken nights at Rockin          Sushi! TO DOUGIE AND LILLIAN!!!          The crowd erupts with laughter and applause. People are          crying, hugging, and standing.           Thank you. Thank you! Now wher's Annie?          Annie? Stand up Annie.          The room looks around. Annie slowly rises.           There she is. Annie is our Maid of Honor          everyone. And I'm sure she'd like to          take this time to say a few words. Annie?          Annie stands up to the applause. The room falls silent as          she walks to the podium.           Um, hello everybody. Hi everyone. 'm          Annie. Wow, it really smells like vanilla          in here.           It's the candles Annie.           Thanks Megan. Lillian this is gonna be          awesome. Um, uh, God, oh, oh, oh, what's          that saying?                                                                                                                 Ayay, um, God, um, what is it? It's a          good one, a good saying, it's Irish. It's          like a-like a toast. Is it Irish?          Something about a road...Oh God, 'm          blanking. So I'll just say I'm so happy          to be a part of this whole celebration          and happiness. You two are so happy          together and hope you have a happy          lifetime of happiness and celebrating.          And I love you and....Lillian, w've been          best friends since we were like 5...'ve          never been to Greece...          't know          if she's done. Annie sees Helen has moved over to sit          next to Lillian.           “Did you ever know that you're my          hero...You're everything I wish I could          be..” C'mon you guys know the words.          Some people reluctantly sing along.           “I could fly higher then an eagle. For          you are the wind beneath my wings. Flyyy,          flyyyyy, so fly into the sky, so fly          until we touch up high--”           Lillian and Annie are at the valet.           Oh my God, tell me I didn't sing.           No, you sang.          They both laugh.           God, I don't know, I was just maybe a          little out of my element, and after          Helen's speech--           Ann, stop.                                                                                                                I'm so embarrassed. What did you think of          your engagement party?           Besides the impromptu concert from Bette          Midler, it was perfect.          They laugh and hug.           I gotta go say bye to some people I do't          know. Drive safe.          Lillian goes back inside. Helen appears out of thin air.           Annie! Great job tonight..           I'm feeling slightly mortified.           No, nononono. Not at all. Everyone gets a          little nervous and carried away during          those kind of things. So listen, 've          been brainstorming some theme ideas for          Lillian's shower. I was thinking          somewhere along the lines of Alice in          Wonderland meets...are you ready?          Hollywood. And for the bachelorette?          Vegas.           Aren't I supposed to be planning some of          these things?           Oh, well, I hadn't heard from you and--           She just got engaged two weeks ago.           Well, I figured since you don't have any          experience that you might get overwhelmed          by events of this caliber.           Helen, I'm pretty capable. I think I can          handle it.          A guest walks by and taps Helen.                                                                                                                Excuse me, you left your poem inside. You          have beautiful cursive.           Thank you.          The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away.           Annie, I didn't mean I didn't think you          couldn't do it. I'm sure you are aware of          all your duties. We'll see--we'll see you          soon.          Helen walks away. A OLD LADY passes by her.           You're very pretty.           Annie!          Megan is running towards her with a piece of paper.           Annie wait! I wanna give you my numbers.          A place just opened up near my house.          From 4-7 every weekday, Karaoke, two          dollar wings and all you can eat MAN          sandwiches if you know what I mean.          Annie is nervous, starts biting her nails.            Your nail too short for french manicure.           (disappointed) Oh well...           That's Ok. I fix for you. Make you sexy.           Oh, great!           Donna and Annie are eating lunch in the break-room.                                                                                                                And then they put a solution in my eyes          to dilate them, which caused temporary          blindness and with the loss of my sight,          my hearing became bionic. Do you need          some help dear?          Annie struggles to open a bag of chips but her new ULTRA          LONG, french-manicured nail-tips are making it very hard.           No, I got it.           Annie and Donna are doing inventory. Annie gets text.           Sorry... Well, it's official. Lillian set          a date. October tenth. Why did I just get          a stomach ache.           Don't be nervous. It's not all on your          shoulders. Doesnt she have other          bridesmaids?           Yeah and they've all done this before so          I'm feeling a little pressure. I have to          make this really nice for Lillian.           I wish I could help. Weddings are a lot          different now then they were in my day.          They look at Donna's wedding picture on her desk.           That dress is beautiful.           I still have it. I was hoping my daughter          Elizabeth would wear it but when she and          Alice had their “ceremony” they both          wanted to wear suits. (beat) Ok, we need          two Shannisburg tennis bracelets.          Annie struggles to write with her nails.           Oops. Hold on a sec, hard to write...                                                                                                                They're very long.            Hi. I need to make these shorter.           No, not sexy!           I know, it's... I can't work with them so          long.           Okay. 7 dollar for file. No more sexy          though.           Ok.           Short nail is ugly.           Alright.           Annie looks up different bridesmaid dress shops            Here it is!           Ooh, Occasionz. I'm impressed.           Everyone this is Occasionz, supposedly          it's you know, one of the best bridal          shops in town, so, that's cool. Oh and          also, there's a restaurant inside, so um,          I figured, we could maybe have lunch          after. So, let's go!          She goes to the door. It is locked. She sees a buzzer.                                                                                                                Oh, I didn't see that.          She presses the buzzer.           Hello?           Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids          dresses.           What's your name?           Oh, Annie.           (snotty) What's the reservation name?           (to the girls) Oh, she must be talking          about the restaurant. (back into the          intercom) No, we're here to look at          dresses.           I heard you the first time. So I take it          you don't have a reservation for the          dress shop?           (whispers) You didn't make a reservation?           Um, no, I'm sorry, I didn't know I had to          make a reservation for that. Sorry!          Anyway, we're all out here now and--           The next available appointment for          bridesmaid fittings is in seven weeks and          we don't take reservations over the          intercom so you'll have to call.           Seven weeks?!           I'm sorry maybe you can't hear me. I just          said a few seconds ago that we do't have          a reservation for the next seven weeks.                                                                                                                 And when you make your reservation do't          forget you'll also need to make an          appointment.           What?           (whispers) You didn't make an          appointment?             No, I can hear you. Would it be possible          for you to make an exception for us          because we drove all the way out here and          I didn't know about the reservation/          appointment thing so...           Hold on.           Annie, we can go somewhere else.           No, no. I'll work it out. Don't worry.           This really is the best place though,          that's the thing.           Listen, I know the--           (intercom] Hello, this is the manager?           Yes, hello!           We can fit you in seven weeks, that is          all we have available. We only take          parties that have a reservation and that          have made an appointment over the phone.          I'm going to ask you to not buzz in          again. Thank you. Byyyyyyye.          Helen approaches the intercom.                                                                                                                Whitney?           (irritated) Yes? Who is this?           Whit, it's Helen.           Helen?! Hiiii!           Hiiii!           Hi!           Hi! Listen, I'm out here with a whole          bunch of girls and we had a little          miscommunication and our reservation-          appointment wasn't made. Is there any way          to fit us in?           Say no more.          Buzzzzzzzz. The girls happily enter.           (sotto} Wow, thanks Helen.           Whitney and Helen are leading the girls down the hall.          Lillian and Annie tail the group.           Ann, don't worry about it. We got in.          Annie sees racks of wedding dresses.           Hey, you want to sneak off and look at          the wedding dresses?           Oh my God. Annie, I didn't tell you?          Guess who Helen is friends with? Lady          Lavonia Jean St. Petsois JuJu.                                                                                                                 That famous wedding dress designer tha's          in all those wedding magazines? As a          favor to Helen she's going to design my          dress for almost nothing. Normally          they're like twenty grand. She's French.           Wow. That's amazing.            I have to send my measurements to France.          Annie is a little disappointed.           They all stand in a room stuffed bridesmaids dresses.          Lillian's cell phone rings.           Surprise, surprise. It's my Mom. Mom? Can          you hold on a second?          She covers the phone and talks to the girls.           Start looking at dresses. I'll be right          back. I think maybe you guys should          decide anyway and pick out something you          like since you're the ones wearing it.          Cool? (nodding) Have fun! What's up Mom?          Ugh! They're booked?          Lillian leaves talking to her Mom.           Ok ladies, start your (french) engines!          Shots of dresses being pulled off of the racks. Fighting          for the same dress, shirts coming off, dresses zipped up          the back and dresses not fitting, etc.           Annie loves the dress she has on. She talks to herself in          the mirror.           Hi I'm Annie. Can I get a martini? What          you mean you need to see I.D.? (giggling)                                                                                                                Annie, in the dress, is talking to the bartender.           Well, with that dress on you look          about... .eleven.           Thank you.          Annie laughs. And turns away right into, a GORGEOUS male          model in a tuxedo.           Excuse me, you dropped an earring.          An UNDERWEAR MODEL appears, in his underwear.           I'll get it for her.           No I will!           I'll get it! I'm a lifeguard.          Tons of men begin to yell and fight over her. The chaos          forces Annie to make a DRAMATIC EXIT from the CASTLE. She          runs down the stairs like Cinderella into the forest.          They men begin to chase her.          She runs through the trees out of breath, she is face to          face with a sexy, sweaty, lumberjack, wh's chopping          wood. It's CHRISTIAN BALE.           Hi.           Hi. I'm Christian Bale. I'm just chopping          some wood, I like to do that between          movies.           Hello Christian.          They hear the voices of the men from the party screaming          for her.                                                                                                                Oh, Christian! I need a place to hide.           Quick, get inside my muscles.          They embrace.           I love this sash.          They look into each others' eyes, just about to kiss and--           Hi Annie!           Helen has flung open Annie's dressing room curtain,          putting an abrupt end to her fantasy.          She is wearing cream colored lingerie, showing off her          TOTALLY amazing body. Annie is uncomfortable.           Look at your cute little boobies. Ooh,          is that the dress you like?           Yeah. I think it will look good on          everybody, it has a sash--           A sash? Annie, this isn't the Sound of          Music tryouts.           Huh?           I told you Becca I can't wear strapless!           Why not?!          Annie and Helen come out to see all the bridesmaids          arguing.           Because, I--                                                                                                                Why don't you two shut your traps? No          one's going to be looking at us. Le's          just get the one with the shawl, 'm          always freezing at these things anyway.           I gotta say I'm still leaning towards the          one that I found.          It is a very ugly.           Absolutely not.           Well, what about this one?          Everybody stops and looks at Annie.           I think it would be flattering on          everyone and we could totally wear it          again. The sash comes in different colors          not just this one.           Everyone! We can't all have the dress          that we want. I've been in a lot of          weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid          dress, you must ask yourself, “If          invited, would I wear this a dress          to...The ACADEMY AWARDS!”           Ooo, I never thought of it that way.          All the girls agree.           With that in mind, I say we wear this          one.          Helen holds up a dress. The girls like it.           Or this one! People wear sashes to the          Academy Awards all the time.           Only if they're nominated for the Sound          of Music.                                                                                                                I think Lillian would like this one.           Well, I think Lillian would like THIS          one.          Lillian walks in.           Hey! I'm hearing lots of excitement in          here.          She touches Helen's dress.           Oooo, I like this one. What about you          guys?           I love it. Right guys?          The girls all agree. Except Annie.           Cool. Let's eat!          Helen dumps the dress in Annie's arms and follows          Lillian.           I think it might look best in cream.           Ooh, good idea.          They exit.           Well, that was easy.          The girls head back to change.           This dress is almost $500!           That's not too bad/that sounds about          right.           No, that's what I'm saying. That's a          great price.                                                                                                                Andrea Bocceli music playing. Waiters in tuxes etc. The          girls sit at a beautiful table looking at men's.           This place is kind of amazing. I did't          even know it existed.           The southwestern cobb is really good. I          come here and eat sometimes.           Great, there's a fly that really likes          me.           They only have salads.           So Annie, what's your deal? Are you          dating anyone?           No, no. Not right now. I had a boyfriend          for three years but we broke up like six          months ago.           Oh, I hate to hear stuff like that! What          happened?           It just didn't work out.           Is that the guy who stole a bunch of          money from you and gave you an STD?          Everyone freezes.           Lillian told me.          Annie shoots Lillian a look.           I'm sorry, I was just talking about you          cause I was worried about you and--                                                                                                                No it's fine. But he didn't steal the          money, I loaned it to him. And HPV is          really common right now.          Everyone looks around.           Around fifty percent of sexually active          men and women acquire HPV at some point          in their lives and by age fifty, eighty          percent of women will be infected with a          genital HPV infection.           Really?           About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect          Americans each year.           Ew, it's on the butter you guys. The          fly's on the butter.           Well, I don't have it.           Very few HPV infections show any signs or          symptoms. Therefore a lot of infected          people don't even know they have it, yet          they transmit the virus to their sexual          partner.          Silent. Everyone is a little grossed out..           Anyway, it's fine, the past is the past.          We weren't meant to be. My last pap-smear          came back normal so that's cule. But you          know, I'm dating, here and there...           Do you have anyone in mind to bring to          the wedding?           Oh, I didn't even think about that.           Who needs a date? Just go stag and make          out with someone there.                                                                                                                If you wanna meet a nice man, Annie, you          should come to karaoke night at my          church. We sing hymns to rock beats!           Wait. I have the perfect guy for you          Annie. Mike Donahue. He went to school          with Kevin.           Mike from the fourth of July last year?          Ooh, I've seen him Ann. He's hot.           Really?           And Kevin said he just sold his company          for an embarrassing amount of money. But          he's totally down to earth. You guys have          to meet. I'm texting Kevin right now.           I know Mike too.          Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter.           The fly just committed suicide. Death by          butter.           Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you          could live out here and see us all the          time!           Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit          around and talk about nothing while your          vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper          towel.           (sotto) Oooh, I didn't know we were going          to hear that word at lunch today.           I was set up with Ernie. As soon as I met          him, I knew.           Yeah Annie, you never know.                                                                                                                Yes.           Annie is lost in thought. She hears. Sirens.           What?! Come on!          She pulls over. Officer Rhodes approaches.           Well, look who it is.           Oh hi.           I see your still driving around with          busted tail lights.           I'm sorry, money's been tight and...I          forgot(laughing). You're not gonna give          me another ticket for that are you?           Nah... The reason I pulled you over          today, is that--(searching) you were          driving too slow. Backing up traffic.           I was?           Yep. You were going ten miles under the          speed limit. That's a moving violation.          It's...underdriving. It's in the books.          But, I'm just going to give you a warning          this time, but I do have to um...write          some stuff down on a piece of paper.          He begins to write. Beat.           Man I'm hungry. I'm doing the Master          Cleanse. You ever heard of it?           Yeah.                                                                                                                Cayenne pepper water for three days now.          It's supposed to clean you out, make you          feel lighter. It's working. The only          problem is I get so hungry. I just want a          big slab of ribs. You ever crave that          kind of stuff?           Don't talk about cravings right now. I am          PMS'ing like crazy. It's taking          everything in me not to stop and the          store and get like three kit-kats and a          bottle of wine. I'm so irritable right          now.          They stare at each other out of awkwardness.           Sorry.           No, it's OK, I've got three sisters. We          had tampons in the pencil drawer.          Sometimes my friends and I would say they          were cigars and smoke'em. (beat) Okay. I          have finished writing down the things I          need to write, on this paper. OH!          He hands her a business card.           This is a buddy of mine. Owns a body shop          in Milwaukee. Might be able to help you          out for a good price with those          taillights. I'll write my name on here          so you can tell him who referred you.           Thanks.           That's my name right there. In case you          forgot it from last time. It's Nathan          Rhodes.           Thanks. Annie. I'll get those fixed. I          get paid next week. Bye!          She drives off. Rhodes wishes he had been more suave.                                                                                                                 Trust me, I've been in the jewelry          business for a long time. Nothing says          “I'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling          silver money clip.          An OLD WOMAN CUSTOMER looks at her stone-faced.           We also have yo-yos you can engrave. In          memory of...um, what's your friend's          name?          The old woman walks away as Sandy approaches.           Paychecks. Here you go Annie.          She and Sandy open their checks.           Oh my God, I scored this week. 'm gonna          buy Sharita a new Panasonic telephone.          It's cordless and has intercom. What          about you Annie?           I'm gonna pay for a cream-colored gown          that I'll never wear again.           Annie is on the phone as she gets ready for her date with          Mike.           Help me! I can't find anything to wear          for my date with Mike tonight.           I don't know. Shoot, I can't talk now.          I'm with Helen and we have a conference          call with Lady Lavonia Jean St. Petsois          JuJu about my dress. Ugh. I'm so sorry.          She's calling! I gotta go. Have fun!          Lillian hangs up. Steve walks in.                                                                                                                That credit lady called you again. I told          her you were at the tailors.           Listen, I'm going on a date. This? (holds          up a dress) or this? (what she's wearing)           I don't like those pants.           What's wrong with'em?           They give you four corners.          Annie's not following.           It's when a girls butt looks like it has          four corners. It's not a good thing.           Shit. These are my only clean pants.           Do you have a tube skirt?           Thanks Steve.           Wait. If you stand like you are right now          facing that angle, it looks good.          She looks in the mirror again, grabs her bag and leaves.           Annie sits next to Mike Donahue. He is tall, dark and          handsome. They have cocktails.           I'm not an expert in corporate real-          estate but I've always been interested in          it. So, yeah I totally agree.          Mike smiles, he is cute!                                                                                                                I have to admit, I told Becca 'm not          really keen on set-ups. I know i's          early, but so far so good.           Me too.           And thanks again for coming from          Milwaukee, I know it's quite a drive.           I can do that drive in my sleep these          days.           Next time maybe I'll come to you.          Annie smiles.           You have got great teeth.           Thank you. I brush'em every day.          She flashes her teeth. The hostess comes up.           Your tables ready.           Finally!          Mike guzzles down his cocktail as they read their menus.           Well, I don't know about you but since          we're at a Thai restaurant, I'm gonna try          the dog.          Mike laughs at his own joke and continues drinking.           So, Becca tells me you play a lot of          tennis.           I try to squeeze in a game now and then.          We should play sometime.                                                                                                                Oh, yeah I haven't rea--            Yeah, my game's pretty solid. I did win a          couple tournaments at the club. I tend to-          Jesus Christ! (whispers) It smells like          B.O. in here huh? I think it's the          people.          A very effeminate waiter brings them their drinks.           Here ya go. I'll be back to take your          order in two secs. I'm swamped!           No problem.           Whoa, get a load of our waiter. 'm          surprised he didn't put pink umbrellas in          our drinks...          Annie laughs, but is a little uncomfortable.           Or AIDS.          Mike laughs. Annie is HORRIFIED. Mike swigs from his          drink.           Seriously, AIDS is crazy. You do't have          it do you?           No.           (singing) Neither do I...          He raises his eyebrows up and down at her.           Annie hasn't touched her food. He's eating with his hands          and drunk. Other patrons are beginning to stare.                                                                                                                 So I started to get a little chub, you          know what that is. How could I not with          those huge canteloupes waving in my face.          Anyway, I looovee massages, am I right?          As he's laughing he lets out a huge burp.           (still laughing) Whoa-ho! Excyuuuuse me!          I got that from Steve Martin.          Still laughing, he pats his pockets.           Oh shit. I forgot my wallet.           Annie's car pulls up.           Annie is on the phone, looking at the herbal drinks.          “Calm” “Focus” “Sex Appeal” “Lean”. She finally picks          “Calm”. RHODES appears holding a bag of mini carrots.           Hey, it's me, I just had to tell you          about my night. Oh my God. Call me.           Annie Walker. I thought I heard your car          out there.           Very funny, Officer...Jones?           Jones? Oh boy. Guess somebody thought he          was a little more memorable than he was.           No. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. I'm          not drunk.           That's ok. Call me Rhodes. (notices her          drink) Trying to get “calm”?                                                                                                                Yeah. Recovering from a date.           Oh.           Finish your cleanse?           Yeah, trying to wean myself back to the          really bad foods I like eating.            Thanks for the drink. (beat) So are you          one of those cops that sits in that same          spot everyday and sneaks up on people?           A lot of people get up to high speeds on          this road. I tell people its better to          pay for a ticket than have your family          pay for a funeral.           That's a very good point.           Want a carrot?           Yes. I'm starving.           They are leaning on the back of his car eating carrots.           Ew! What is this?          Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot.           Oh, you got the ugly carrot.           The what?                                                                                                                There's one in every bag. You should eat          it.           No. I think you should eat it. The're          your carrots.          He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands.           No, no! Don't eat it! EW!!!          She throws it on the ground.           Don't litter.          He picks it up.            I don't think I've ever wanted to get of          out a restaurant faster in my life.           Yeah, I don't go on blind dates. It seems          unnatural.           I have no idea what am I going to tell my          friends who set us up.           Just tell her the truth.           Yeah. You're probably right.          Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car.           It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's          unpredictable. I don't know, I always          wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's          kind of financially impossible right now.          Plus I'd feel like ninety around all          those college students.                                                                                                                You know my dad used to say that life is          like a hallway of doors. You can stand at          the same door forever if you want. Or you          can open a different door. And that one          may not be the right door, but i'll open          up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway,          it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I          opened a door and the next thing I knew I          was a cop. And I love my job.           Hmm. I think I get it?           Or you can always sell moon-pies by the          side of the road.           Moonpies. What?           It's a joke. You had moon-pies in your          car the first time I pulled you over.           Oh yeah.           They are waiting in line.           When I get married I don't want the kind          of wedding people have these days. I want          it to be like a carnival. You know dunk          tanks? People win prizes...           Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze          artists and a big scale to guess the          bride's weight.           Ok, first of all that's a circus wedding          and I'm talking about a carnival wedding.                                                                                                                Sorry. (to clerk) Yeah I'll have the          number four, and can you make that Super          Biggie?           They are sitting in the restaurant, mouths full of            And then she moved to Hawaii and now          lives with a guy who sells shaved ice.          And supposedly she has really long armpit          hair now. That's pretty much the last          girlfriend I had.           Well, lets just say my last boyfriend          that I lived with broke up with me over          the phone. Then come to find out, he had          borrowed $30,000 in my name without          telling me, putting me in horrible debt          that I'm still paying off. Because I          can't find him.           Wow. You win.           Annie in her car, engine running.           Oh my gosh. It's twelve thirty! I should          probably...           Oh, before you go. There is something I          want to give you. I was gonna wait but, I          think you'll want this now.          He jokingly gives her the ugly carrot.           For me?!           Well I know you've had a terrible night.          He gives it to her. Her phone rings.                                                                                                                Sorry, one sec. Hello? Ted!? Hey! Oh my          gosh! No,no. Can you hold on a sec?          She waves at Rhodes and mouths...           I guess I'll see you around?           Yeah. Don't forget about those          taillights. They're really starting to          bug me.           K. Bye.(to Ted) So, you're in town?           He opens the front door, leading Annie out again.           Next time I won't call so late.           No, it was fine. Like I said, I mean I          was just driving.           Awesome. It's cool that we can just          hookup and whatever. No strings.           Me too. I love it. I feel good right now.           Cool. Bye.           Annie pulls in, her tank is way passed empty. She looks          in her purse frantically.           Shit!! No! No! I left my fucking credit          card at the restaurant! Shit!          She picks up her phone and dials.                                                                                                                Hi, Donna, it's Annie. Um, sorry but I          just ran out of gas and I'm gonna be a          little bit late. Yes, I know, 'm really          sorry. I will get there as soon as I          can. I promise, I'm so sor---hello?           Annie comes running onto the floor putting her tie on.           Annie, hi! I almost left, but they said          that you were coming and that you were          late.          Helen is standing there looking gorgeous.           I had to come into Milwaukee for a          charity luncheon right down the street          and I thought I'd come in and say hi.           Hi!           And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I          thought it'd be fun to pick up some          little gifts for all the girls.           Leader of the bridesmaids? Um, wouldn't          that technically be me? Honor?           Well, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of          Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out          of all of us, I'm the leader. Anyway, it          doesn't matter. Um, I wanted to get          something that we could wear to the          rehearsal dinner or something. That would          be fun. Where are the diamonds?           Oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a          tortoise-shell handled sterling silver          letter opener? No? Ok, let me get Sandy.           Oh! And Annie we really need to start          planning the bachelorette.                                                                                                                Yes. Yes. I'm on it. Got some ideas. So          I'll let you know.           Can't wait.           Annie arrives home from work frazzled to find Steve on          the couch watching the same Home Improvement show.           Wow, well I have never seen a          transformation like this. This old tour          bus is stunning.           Thanks.           Unbelievable. (to Annie) You got another          package from your mom.           Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like          I said I'll pay you back as soon as I          can.          She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer.           No problem. But you should always put gas          in when it gets to a quarter tank.          Especially cause you have such a shitty          car.           Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do          you think of Vegas?           Ooo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a          black hole but I must have it in my life.          Does that make sense?           I'm just asking because some of the girls          are talking about going for Lillia's          bachelorette party and I've never been.                                                                                                                Oh no. Now I don't know about weddings.          When you go on a bachelorette, does the          bride pay?           No, everyone pays for themselves. And you          pay for the bride.           Ok, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford          that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare,          hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show          tickets. Remember this morning? You          cannot afford Vegas.           Well, I could save up for it.           No, you need to win a contest to go to          Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday.          Ooh, “Night Moves.” Can I have this?          A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head. Steve holds the          blazer out and reads the tag.           Told you I'd pay you back!          Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer          and begins typing feverishly.          We see these words: “Dear bridal party”, “great idea”,          “bachelorette party”, “Florida”, “Sea World!”, “Free          place to stay!”. She presses send, and is very pleased.          The phone immediately rings.           Hello?           Hi.           Hi.           Hiiiii.                                                                                                                Hi Helen.          Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All          around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing          candles. There are too many flames.           I just got your e-mail. Um...Sea World?           Well it's not just Sea World. It's a          weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and          I were kids we went there and she loved          it and has always talked about going          back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really          mean a lot to her. We could stay at my          Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then          we could go out at night and got to the          beach and then Sea World on one of the          days.           But a bachelorette at Sea World?           Like I said, Sea World would just be a          part of it.           Well, I have been talking to the other          girls, and I was thinking we should go to          Las Vegas!          Annie's other line rings.           Oh, can you hold on? That's my other          line.          She clicks over.           Hello?           Hi, Annie. It's Becca.          Becca, in her shabby-chic home office paints a front          porch sign that says “The Whitman's”                                                                                                                I was just looking at your e-mail, yo're          so cute. Sea World. What about Turkey?          That's where we went for for MY          bachelorette.           Oh well, Turkey's really far away.           It's super old though! They have awesome          restaurants. It's very exotic. Have you          ever seen Aladdin? It totally looks like          that.           Hang on...          Annie clicks back over to Helen.           Helen, I'm sorry can I call you back?           When?           Just a few minutes. I'll call you back.          Annie clicks over.           Becca?           Hi. You know, if you wanna go some place          closer than Turkey. Helen JUST e-mailed          me about going to Vegas.           Oh, I don't know. Everybody always goes          to Vegas. It seems just cliche to me.           I never get sick of it. I love blackjack.          I have a system.          Annie's other line.           Oh, my other line's ringing. Can I call          you back?                                                                                                                When?           Soon.          Annie clicks over.           Hello?           Annie, it's Dana!           Of course it is..          Dana is on her porch swing drinking lemonade.           I love your idea about Sea World.           Really?           Yeah, but then Helen just called me and          said we should go to Vegas.           But Vegas is so hot, don't you think?          It's like, hot and dry. People get sick          there all the time.           I haven't had that experience. My skin          always clears up there.           Yeah, I just think it's probably not--          Hold on. (clicks over) Hello?           Annie, it's Megan.          Megan is at work, in front of a wall of computer and          television screens. It is a technical haven, looks like                                                                                                                 I can't talk right now, but I was          thinking for the bachelorette, something          more along the lines of a personal          challenge weekend. Have you ever heard of          the Nevada Project?           (defeated) No.          Leslie in her Sopranos style living room on a treadmill.          Her kids run around.           I gotta be honest. I've been married for          nine years, this may be the last          bachelorette party of my career and I          want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man          pounding me in the face at some point          during this trip. I'll pay whatever I          have to pay. (to the kids) Tyler stop it,          put that back! Paul!            Vegas has these party busses that have          flat screens in them and dance floors--           Or we could take hummer limos around          everywhere.           That sounds really expensive.           Oh but it's gonna be so much fun! Besides          money shouldn't be a problem if Lillian's          our friend.           Oh no, no, I was just thinking about          everyone else. That's all I'm saying.           What I'm saying is, they drop you off in          the middle of the desert. You have to          kill your own food and find your way          back. Not everyone makes it. Seriously.                                                                                                                Seriously. I want balls in my face.           So I think Vegas is a good idea.           I agree with Helen. Vegas.           Oh, you know what else is in Nevada?          Vegas!           Balls. Vegas.           Vegas it is.           (on the phone) Holy Shit Annie! We're          goin' to Vegas!            (eating a cookie)          No can do, I need all my shifts. 'm          trying to save up and take my lady to          Maui.           Please, one day a week, just for a little          while. I've already asked everybody else.          I really need the money.           Sorry. My hands are tied. Sharita's got          my dick in a chip-clip.           That's alright. I understand.           Mmm. Mm. These are the best peanut butter          titties you ever made.           They're called peanut butter kisses.           That's not what they look like.                                                                                                                The bridesmaids sit in first class. In the distance,          Annie's head pops up from her seat in row 3O of coach.           The girls wait by the curb with their luggage. Megan          appears next to Annie.           Here we are. The city of lust. Annie, do          you know how many men are looking for          trouble in this town right now? We are          gonna nail it down. We should tell          everybody we're twins cause guys looking          up with twins!           Yeah, I've heard that. Ok everybody! You          guys, hey we're here, we're in Vegas!          Woo!          Lillian walks up.           Annie, come here. Why didn't you tell me          you weren't sitting with us?           Oh, it's no big deal. I didn't want to          blow all my money on a first class          ticket. I'm here though, right?!           I'm so excited!           Ok, you guys, gather around. Welcome to          Lillian's bachelorette party! We should          probably get a bunch of cabs and head to          our beautiful hotel, The New Marquis          Royal Suites...          As Annie's talking, a limo pulls up behind her. “The New          Marquis Royal Suites.”           Lillian, look what's happening.                                                                                                                Oh my God. You guys, is this for us?!           I got a limo from the hotel.          We're in Vegas! Yaaaay!!          They all pile into the limo, excitedly talking.           Ok, everyone just get in the car. Got a          ride to the hotel. It's taken care of.           (from inside the limo) Sit by me, Annie!           The girls' excited talking continues into the lobby.           This hotel is amazing! You guys!           Come on Lillian, you're staying with me          in the master suite. It's all set.           Oh! Okay! Then party in room 812 in one          hour! (waving her key)           Girls get off the elevator, giddy with excitement. Annie          gets back into the elevator.           Uh! Shoot! I left my sunglasses          downstairs. Ugh! Where's my head?           Annie sneaks out, rolling her bag. She catches a cab.           Cab pulls up to a tiny broken down building. A sign reads          “Hotel Rick. Vacancy. Some T.V.s.” An old man rides a          bicycle in circles in the parking lot, smiling.                                                                                                                Lobby is very outdated. Wood panel walls etc., The hotel          brochure is on the desk. It is probably the picture she          saw online, it does NOT look the same. The clerk enters.           Hi, I have a reservation for Walker.          RICK, an East Indian man, stands behind the desk in front          of a large portrait of himself, posed exactly as he is          now, with the same outfit. He holds the pose, smiling.           Okay, two nights?           Yes.          Rick waits for her to notice the painting, but she never          does.           Do you want towels?           Yes.           Do you need sheets?           Yes.           No pillow though, ok?          Annie just stares at him.           The door opens to reveal a gorgeous huge feminine suite.           (gasp) OH MY GOD!           Annie opens her door holding unfolded sheets and towels.          The room is very ugly, bare mattress, lots of brown.                                                                                                                Oh my God.           Megan and Leslie stand in their grande bathroom. Hot tub,          plush towels, flat screen T.V. Candles burning.           Oh my gosh, I can't believe this.           He-llo Vegas!           There's an old toothbrush and comb by the dirty sink, a          pair of athletic socks hanging over the shower rod where          a curtain should be. There is a cat staring at her.           Hello cat.           Dana and Becca open their curtains revealing a          spectacular view. They scream and jump up and down.           Annie opens up her curtains to a back lot. Something is          on fire! Rick tries to put it out. The old man rides by.           (screams in shock)           Annie stands outside room 312. She is dressed more          preppy than she's ever looked. She knocks on the door.          Becca opens it. We see disco lights and hear rap music.          There are shirtless male waiters, penis balloons and a          slide show of naked men. The room looks like a sex club.          The girls are dressed like borderline prostitutes.           Oooh, Annie's here!                                                                                                                Wooooooh!           Isn't this amazing?          Lillian runs over and hugs Annie, wearing a condom veil          and drinking out of a penis straw.           Annie! I wanna see a drink in your hand          in one minute!          Lillian pulls Annie into the room. Helen is getting off          of the phone.           Ok you guys, change of plans. The Velour          Cobra had an opening at 9 so I got us a          dinner reservation. Isn't that radical?           Woohooo/Ooooh/Alright!           Oh. Yeah. Cool. Alright          Everyone raises their glasses. The night has begun.           Annie is concentrating on the bill.           Okay, mine was...great, got it.          Becca scoots in next to her.           Annie, I didn't get a chance to ask you,          how was your date with Mike? Give me all          the details.           Oh, um, we had dinner.           Do you think you'll go out with him          again? He told Kevin he thought you were          really great and hot.                                                                                                                (from her end of the table) Hey wha's          the damage down there?           Oh, I got it right here, I figured out          what I owe so, should I just pass it          around?           Why don't we just all split it? It's so          much easier.           Yeah/Just split it/Who cares?           Yeah, it's probably just easier...just          split it.           Here, let me see it. Ok.. .It's a hundred          each plus tip.           (sotto) I had soup and ice water.           Plus we're paying for Lillian...everyone          just put $125.           (sotto) No alcohol...or any real food.           It'll all even out by the end of the          night.           How does it even out? How does that          happen?          Everyone, including Annie, puts in their money. Helen          moves over to Annie.           Thank you everybody!!           Annie, don't tell Lillian, it's a          surprise.                                                                                                                 My friend Sean Michael works for a          promotional company and they're having          this big event tonight at Tara Rei's          stepbrother's Club, Sacrifice.           Really?!           I think it should be our first stop. H's          reserving seats for us in the VIP          section. It's a $150 cover and there's a          one bottle champagne minimum of $750 per          table, he said people from the Real World          go in there all the time.           I thought we were going to the Jungle          Lounge after this.           We are. After that.           Oh...um...wow. Awesome. Here's the thing          I was going to stop by the hotel, the          Marquis Suites. I think I ate something          weird on the plane probably, my stomac's          not right.           Oh, well we're only gonna be there for an          hour or so, you can just meet up with us          after.           Okay. Perfect.           I'll just text you when we're getting          ready to leave. I hope you feel better.          Lillian comes up already a little tipsy.           Ok, Leslie spilled the beans. Le's get          our asses over to Sacrifice.          What are we waiting for? Wooooooo!          Lillian looks at Helen's legs.           Whoa whoa. Helen, turn around. Are those          those Ransom Jeans?                                                                                                                Don't tell Perry I bought them,I ordered          them from New York. They're insanely          expensive. But I gotta tell you guys the          compliments I get on my ass make them          worth every penny.          She sticks her butt out. Lillian slaps it and all the          girls laugh. She is the life of the party.           A party bus pulls up. As the doors open, dry ice pours          out. Inside there's a disco ball, dance poles, crazy          lights. The girls all scream and run onto the bus. With          the commotion, no one notices that Annie stays behind.           Annie enters casino alone, sadly weaves through the slot          machines.           “My Prerogative” by Bobby Brown comes on VERY LOUD making          conversation difficult. Lillian looks around for Annie.           Oh my God, Annie our song! Wher's Annie?           What?!           Where's Annie?!           I don't know!(to Helen) Where's Annie!           What?!!           Where's Annie!           She's meeting us later!!!           (to Lillian) Oh. She's meeting us there!                                                                                                                Why!?           I don't know! Why?           Annie HAS DIARRHEA!!           Is she okay?! Should I call her!?           She's fine! She's gonna meet us in an          hour, it's all set! (to the other girls]           They continue partying, drinking, dancing.           Annie passes four fun college age party guys at a craps          table.           No, no, no wait. Wait. (to Annie) Hey,          will you roll for me? Can she roll for          me?           Only if she's playing.           Me? What do I have to roll?           Anything but a seven or eleven, as many          times as you can. What's your name?           Annie.           I'm Dave. This is Brian, Brian and Mark.          Ok Annie, do your thing.          Annie rolls a four. The guys all cheer.           Yeah! Four!          Annie rolls again, another four. She laughs.                                                                                                                Yeah, four! Holy shit, two fours. One          more time, third time's a charm!          Annie rolls again. Another four. She ca't believe it!           Four! Ahhhhhhhhh! (giddy laughing)           Annie! Annie! Annie!          Annie gets a text message.           Oh, hold on. You guys, my phone.           No cell phones at the tables m'am.          Its a casino rule.           I'll go outside then.           No, you gotta play the game out. You have          to finish your roll.          She continues to roll all fours. The guys scream.           The guys are carrying Annie on their shoulders, cheering          for her. She is laughing..           Ok, guys put me down, put me down. Whoa,          that's my breast.           Sorry.          She reads a text message from Helen. “We're leaving          Sacrifice. It's boring. Meet us at the Jungle Lounge”           It was nice meeting you guys. I gotta go.           What do you mean? Where are you going?                                                                                                                I'm here with a bunch of friends and 'm          supposed to meet them at this club.           We love clubs! We'll come with you.           Come on, we'll get your cab.           Oh, Ok.          As the cab drives away, we hear:           Dude, we gotta get Brian some food asap.          I've seen that look before.           Everyone eats huge burgers including the driver (not          Annie, she is annoyed!)           You guys almost done?           Sorry we haven't eaten all day.           I have NEVER seen a drive-thru line like          that dude.           It's because of the concert.          They continue eating.           The cab is pulled over, all the guys are outside, peeing.          Annie gets a text from Lillian. “The Jungle Lounge is          awesome! We need to dance. P.S. It's RAINING in here!          WHERE ARE YOU? Xoxo Lil”          She texts back, “On my way!”                                                                                                                A huge fist fight is going on in the car, yelling etc.           Traffic has stopped.           How much further?           Do you think I know? How do you think I          know?           Annie and the guys get out of the cab.           Oh, shit. We can't go into this place. We          got kicked out last night.           Hey, what'd I tell you guys?!!!           Whoa, it's ok, we're just goin next door!           Oh, Annie, here's your cut of the craps          money. Eight hundred bones.           For me?           You won big for us tonight. Buy your          friends a round of drinks and come next          door after.           Yeah, bring your friends.           Bye guys.           The Roller!!!                                                                                                                Woohoo/Yeah/ The Roller!/Annie!          They all high five. Annie turns to bouncer.           Hi. One please?           60 bucks.           Here ya go.           Annie walks through the club. She calls Lillian. No          answer. She gets a a drink. Time passes. Her phone rings!           Annie!           Hello!?           Are you ok?           Yeah, I'm fine. I'm here! Where are you?!           What do you mean here, where?           I'm at the Jungle Lounge, where are you          guys? This place is huge!           You're where?           The club!           Listen I can't hear you! We had to leave          the Jungle Lounge, Becca--           What?!                                                                                                                Meet us at the--           Hello?!!           Loud music. Lillian tries to call Annie back. Annie tries          to call Lillian back. They both get voice-mails. Annie          gives up. It starts pouring rain on her inside the club.          Everyone jumps up and screams with excitement. Thunder!           Me Tarzan, you Jane. It's time for the          dance spotlight. If it lands on you, you          gotta shake it!          The spotlight immediately lands on a soaking wet Annie.          She dances very angrily. Jungle dancers dance very close          to her and put vines around her neck.           Annie walks in.           Yeah, she's back/ the Roller!/ Yeah!           What happened to you?           I don't even know.           Roller, I can't stand seeing you like          this. (to bartender] Get this fine lady a          shot!           I'll have two lemon drops.           Annie and Dave are wasted.                                                                                                                That's what I'm saying. Some people have          everything and others have just little          bits of things. It's not fair. I don't          get it.....I mean I think I hate Helen.           I hate Helen.           That is the sexiest think anyon's ever          said.           In the dark, Annie and Dave are passionately making out.          Knocking things over, etc.           I hate Helen.           The cat jumps on the bed and meows. Annie opens her eyes          to see Dave sleeping. She notices his college tattoo on          his arm (tasmanian devil with a lacrosse stick?).           Hey.           Hi. Sorry I fell asleep while we were          making out. I guess I was pretty tired.           Its ok. Sorry I gave you a hickey.           Oh shit.          There's a knock at the door. Annie opens it to reveal          NICOLE, (20), pretty and sweet.           Is Dave here?           Nicole!? Hey, Nic.           This is a surprise.                                                                                                               Brian 1, Brian 2 and Mark appear in the doorway as well.           Dude, I'm sorry. She made us bring her          here.           She said you have her fake I.D..           Yeah and I couldn't go anywhere last          night. I tried calling you fifty fucking          times. And YOU? You were what, hooking up          with this fossil?!           First of all-           Shut the fuck up or I will kick your ass          bitch.           Ok, that is not nice.           And what are you forty?           No, I'm in my low thirties...(under her          breath) and you could never kick my ass.           What did you say?!           (timid) You heard me.          Annie immediately gets punched in the face. Annie is          shocked and swings back, hitting Nicole in the face.          She's proud of herself. Nicole's two friends enter and          jump on Annie. HUGE GIRL FIGHT.           Annie is outside of the hotel. Guys are pulling the girls          off of Annie.           Baker Community College bitch!                                                                                                               The girls leave in victory. Dave turns and mouths to          Annie “I'm sorry.”           She frantically tries to cover up her HUGE hickey and          evidence of the fight, with make-up. She remembers a          small cowboy print tablecloth from the other room and          wraps it around her neck like a scarf.           All the girls are hung over and eating. Annie arrives.           Annie!           Whoa. What are you, going to a rodeo?           That's hilarious.           Annie, you missed it. I scammed all night          last night. I met this guy named Darwin.          He works for Cingular. He had a friend.           What happened to your face?           Yeah, why are you wearing all that          makeup?           It's covering up bruises, cuts and a          hickey. I got into fight with a community          college student and her friends because I          spent the night with her boyfriend after          spending the entire night trying to find          you.           What?!           Forget it.                                                                                                                I was trying to find YOU. I tried to call          you all night!           Well, I-(to Lil} Can I talk to you for a          minute?          Annie takes Lillian away.           What is going on? You told Helen you were          sick.           I wasn't sick. Helen told you that          because... I couldn't afford to go with          you guys.           Why didn't you say something?--           Lillian, we're going to be late for our          honey facials.           Helen, can you just give us a minute?           I'm just saying, we're gonna be late. I          don't wanna be rude.           That's funny. You know what? As the Maid          of honor, which is what I am and what you          are not, I am asking you to just give us          a minute.           Excuse me Annie.           No, excuse me!           Annie take it easy.           I need to take it easy?                                                                                                                Annie, if it makes you feel any better          (getting emotional] I got slapped last          night.           Here we go...           By this huge girl. She was a working in          the bathroom. I just... I didn't cut in          line. I didn't! She chased me!           Becca it's over.           Annie, she looked like Popeye.           She lives here! She lives in Vegas.           You're not going to run into her. Just          shut-up about it.           Guys stop! Please! Annie, I'm so sorry          about last night. I feel horrible. I want          to hear everything that happened.          Tonight, you're not leaving my side.          We're hittin' the strip club all of us          and we're going to put this shit behind          us. Okay?!          The girls agree. Dana rubs her arm.           Oh your arm does not still hurt.           Bridesmaids window shop. Something in a fancy boutique          catches Annie's eye, she smiles. Ransom jeans.           The ladies sit at the front row tables.           What can I get you ladies?                                                                                                                First of all , we're gonna need some ones          over here. Here's a hundred. Keep twenty          for yourself.           Oooh, Ann!          A siren goes off.           Good evening ladies, and welcome to          Thunderbird. Our first male entertainer          has been roaming the prairie for many,          many lonely nights...          A horse winnies. Ladies scream.           Here he is...looking for a sweet lady to          keep him company under the stars...say          hello to Cowboy Ron!          A male stripper comes out on a cardboard horse, humping           looking for someone. The room goes wild.           There he is ladies looking for that          special woman, looking for his          briiide...And I believe the person he's          looking for is Lillian Donovan!          The girls scream. Lillian mouths to Annie “I'm gonna kill          you.” Cowboy Ron takes her up on stage. He puts her in a          chair and humps her face. Everyone is cracking up.           Leslie, your missing it.           Don't talk to me. Nobody talk to me.          Leslie has her hands on the bare ass of a stripper who is          dancing in her face.          Stripper #2 appears.           Wow, looks like Cowboy Ron has a friend          on the prairie and he's lookin' for a          lady too.                                                                                                                (pointing to Annie) Get her! Get her!!            Stripper #2 pulls Annie up to the stage, lays her on the          ground and simulates sex with her. Standing above her,          pulls his chaps off. We see that his balls are not all          the way tucked into his g-string. The girls cringe. As he          stands above her, in slow motion, we see a bead of sweat          leave his balls and fly into Anni's open laughing mouth.          She dry heaves. The stripper is oblivious, goes to          another girl.          Lillian and Annie roll around on the ground laughing.           Everyone's laughing as they exit the club.           I need some gum.           That was disgusting! I'm so glad I'm          married.           It was awesome!           I got a picture of the balls. I got it!           (puts her arm around Annie). You lucky          bitch.           Only you Annie. Hands down, best moment          of the weekend.          Annie finally feels a part of the group.           Annie walks to first class, everyon's sleeping. She          hears Lillian laughing really hard, pointing at pictures          in a magazine.                                                                                                                Oh look, there's your boyfriend.           Ew, he's like 65. Ok, look Lillian that's          you.           Oh my God. You know who that actually          looks like? Remember when we went to          Miami and we had to rent towels--           Ew, at that beach, that weird beach!           And that lady came up to us wearing that          mesh top!           She was crazy.          Annie sinks. A flight attendant appears.           Excuse me. Hi.           Hi.           I'm sorry, you can't be up here. You have          to go back to coach.           I was just stretching my legs.           That's not true.          Annie stares at her. The flight attendant holds out her          hand for Annie to grab.           Come on...it's ok, c'mon. C'mon.            Ok, that's going to be seventy -five          dollars.                                                                                                                What?           Twenty-five dollars a day. Three days.          Seventy -five dollars.           I thought it was seven.           Oh, hmm mm. That's for this lot, you          parked in this lot.          The lots are exactly the same, separated by a white line.          Annie empties her wallet, her poker winnings are gone.           Annie is driving. She sees Rhodes, and stops.            Oh, I know what's going on. You're          jealous of that Helen girl.           Excuse me? No, I'm not.           If you say so.           I'm telling you I am not jealous of          Helen, okay? She's tall and thin and rich          and pretty.          They both laugh.           Oh come on, you know you got it goin'          on...           Oh yeah, I got it goin' on...           You're right, you don't.                                                                                                                (laughing) Thanks a lot.          They nudge each other. He accidentally nudges her off the          car.           Sorry!          Now Annie is back in her running car.           Have a good rest of your shift.           Actually, I'm heading home. Got my sister          staying with me for a few days. Sh's          been thinking of divorcing of her          husband.           Oh. Sorry.           He had an affair and they've got kids so          it's complicated.           Hmm. Sounds familiar.           My sister is a hell of a woman, you know?          And her husband is- you know what I think          cheating is? It's weak. It's a weak          person that cheats.          Something clicks with Annie, she sees him in a new light.           No, no. Um, I feel the same way. Um,          anyway um, maybe I'll drive by you next          week. I have to make this drive          again...so...          She tries to flirt a little, pulls her hair back. He sees          her hickey!!!! She starts itching her arm, still flirting          and laughing.           Ugh, great, I think I was allergic to the          soap at the hotel. Ahhhhh.                                                                                                                Yeah. I should go..now. Don't forget to          call my friend about those tail lights.          They're really starting to bug me.           I promise. Ok, well, have a good weekend.           You too.          He abruptly walks back to his car. She drives away          confused.           Annie arrives home to another “mom” package. She pulls          out some cheap cosmetics. She pulls out a bottle of White          Diamonds perfume by Elizabeth Taylor, low calorie mints,          some pepper spray, a book titled “100 Survival tips For          the Independent Woman.” A check for $25.          She opens the book, sees chapters entitled “You Don't          Have to Work for AAA to Change a Tire.” “ How to Jack a          CarJacker.” “Anyone with Arms Can Skin a Deer” etc. She          tries to read but the itching is driving her crazy.           Annie's on the table while the DOCTOR examines her skin.           Well, I've got good news for you. You're          going to live. Hahahah. It's not an          allergic reaction though.           Oh, that's good.           You've got body lice.           Oh.           Have you recently come in contact with or          slept anywhere that you think you might                                                                                                                 I know where I got it.           You're gonna have to wash every fabric in          your apartment and I'll give you a          topical cream that should knock it out          pretty quick. I've got some samples.           Annie sits on the doorstep. Lillian runs up with a bunch          of stuff in her arms and opens the door. They enter the          apartment.           I'm so sorry. I was at our travel agen's          trying to figure out how to get my da's          family out here, they all have to fly at          different times, uggh. What's that on          your arms?          She sees some of Annie's lice medicine motion.           Huh? Oh...I did a face mask. I must have          gotten some on me and didn't rinse it.           Oh shit, I'm sorry, I have to check one          thing really quick. When is my hair          consultation?          Lillian frantically looks through her calender.           Listen, I want to talk to you about--           Oh no. (starts to cry)           What's wrong?           I knew it. I'm going to have my period on          my wedding day...and my honeymoon!           It's ok. I mean it's not like it's your          first time doing it.                                                                                                                It's our wedding night though!           You can still have sex, just put a towel          down in the bed.           I can't believe this. This sucks. (beat)          Oh, Annie I wanted to ask you. Do you          think for the cocktail party before the          reception we should have a string trio or          a horn trio?           Can you just realize what you just asked          me right now?           What?           You just said a string trio or horn trio.          I thought you didn't want anything fancy,          you know, just “keep it simple.” “Not a          big deal.”           I know but now that I'm planning          everything it's just...I wanna do it          right. It's once in a life time. It's my          wedding.          Lillian's phone rings.           Ugh! It's Dougie's Mom. She's mad at me          because I won't let her invite everyone          from her work. Oh! That reminds me. If          you're not going to bring anybody, will          you let me know? I gotta free up some          spots. (into phone] Hello?          Lillian walks away with the phone. Annie is speechless.           Dryer is going. Annie is sorting a huge pile of sheets,          towels, etc. Her cell phone rings.           Helen.                                                                                                                 Annie? Where are you? Inside a truck?           No, I'm doing laundry, what's up?           Annie, the shower needs to happen soon.          We haven't heard from you and everyone is-           I know. I know. I'm trying to--           Annie can I dialog openly with you? I          know you're having some financial trouble          and I think it would be best if I did the          shower. Now before you say anything, let          me say that showers can be very expensive          and I think what's important here is          what's best for Lillian.           Wow.           You don't have to give me an answer now            You should have it. You should have it.           Great. Well, I'll definitely need some          help.           Ok?           Could you bring the cookies?          Annie hangs up, looks at her laundry piles. Pissed.           Annie behind her counter.                                                                                                                Excuse me!!          A snotty thirteen year old, valley-type, rich girl stands          at Annie's counter with an iced coffee chewing gum.           I'm looking for a birthday gift for my          best friend.           Your best friend?           Yeah.           For now.           (sip] What do you mean?           Well, what's gonna happen when you get          older? Did you ever think of that? What          about when she makes new friends and          they're more successful than you are?          Girl stares annoyingly, chewing and sipping.           Huh? And they buy her facials and          designer dresses for cheap and yo're          stuck selling jewelry to teenagers wh's          outfit cost more than your rent?           Ummm....you're weird.           You're stupid.           You have no chin.           You're gonna be a slut in high school.           You are an old, single loser who has no          friends, works in a jewelry store, colors          her own hair, and will never know the          feeling of owning a luxury car.                                                                                                               She sips in victory, slurps up the last drop noisily.           (quietly] You. Little. Cunt.          The girls eyes widen. The camera pans to show that the          girl's dad and Donna have been there the whole time.           Donna stands across from Annie wh's cleaning out her          locker. She sadly starts to leave.           Bye.           You know, I knew a girl once. Karen          Stippleton. She was really something. The          life of the party, a concert pianist, she          had naturally curly hair, and skin black          as night. But one evening at a dinner          party I walked in on her in the bathroom          putting a vile of cocaine up her buttocks          and last I heard, she was playing the          saxophone outside of a drug store. And          I'm gonna say something to you I should          have told her. Don't waste your life.          Find out what your gifts are and use          them.          Donna hugs Annie, then leaves her in the break room.           Annie arrives completely depressed. Outside her doorstep          is yet another package. Annie takes it inside.            Ooh, another package from your mom?           Yep.          It is a beautiful pink and white striped box with her          name and address in calligraphy. When Annie opens the          lid, “Canon in D” plays and a real butterfly flies out.                                                                                                               She reads, “A Shower for Lillian.” Steve comes over to          see.          On one side of the box, there is a beautiful sculpture of          Lillian and Dougie as Bride and Groom, a candle with          Lillian's face printed on it and some chocolates. Annie          takes the invitation out, opens it quickly.           Are you kidding me?          The invitation reads:           Please join us for a Parisian Brunch at          the home of Helen Harris III to celebrate          the marriage of Lillian Donovan and          Douglas Price.

Yay!          Annie picks up the phone, calls the R.S.V.P. number.          Canon in D. plays. and a recorded message begins.           Hello. This is Helen.

I'm Helen Harris IV, and this          is me saying au revoir! But before I do,          here's a message from SUSAN SARANDON!                                                                                                                Hello, I'm Susan Sarandon, the movie          star. I just wanted to say          congratulations to Lillian and Dougie.          Even though I don't believe in marriage,          I do “believe in the church of basebal”.          Just kidding. That's a line from my movie          Bull Durham. I-          Annie hangs up quickly.           Annie's relaxation CD is playing as she lies talking on          the phone to her Mom, who is painting a very life-like          picture of Enrique Iglesias in concert.           Is there an animal over there?           No, it's a C.D.          She rolls over and turns it off.           So, I'm flying straight to O'Hare the day          of the shower cause I wanna get my hair          done. Did you see that invitation? I          didn't get the significance of the dead          butterfly, but it looks like w're gonna          have fun.           I'm not.           Oh, c'mon.           I already know what it's gonna be like.          It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird...I          don't wanna go.           Sweetie, listen to yourself. You ca't          let her new friends get in the way of          your being a part of one of the best days          of Lil's life. NO way. You have a history          with her that no one else has. So you          walk into that party knowing that.                                                                                                                Annie drives to Helen's. She sees a pink and white          highway sign (that looks like a traditional highway exit          sign) “Lillian's Shower Rue. This exit”           Oh my God.          She turns into the gates of “Whitewater Estates.” There          is, a life-size sculpture of a bride and groom. As she          gets closer, she sees they are real life models. They          smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by.          At the next stop sign, a butler appears with a tray.           Are you a guest of Helen Harris?           Yes.           The shower is one mile away.          He hands her a pink lemonade.           I don't have a cup-holder.          As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside          her car.            One flies in her car. They're Rose petals!          Annie's shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose          petals. At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a          pink bow-tie and beret. As she reaches for her gift from          the passenger seat, another valet opens that door and          take it.           This will be placed in the gift room for          you madame.          He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him.           I'll take those.                                                                                                               Annie watches the valet drives her car away. When she          turns back around, there is a man with a white horse          holding out his hand to her.           Would you like an assisted ride to the          main house?           Do I have to?          An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with          the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies. She          dismounts.          The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she          enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her...           This is the most amazing shower 've ever          been to/Can you believe this?/What a          lucky bride/What a good friend...          Helen's house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches          are puffy, etc. Annie walks to the backyard. We hear          French standards. Beautiful tables are set. Swans and          bunnies milling about. Attendants ready to serve. In the          middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round          “sign” that says “Lillian and Dougie” in puffy pink          cursive. A waiter offers Annie champagne. She takes it.           Annie!          They walk to her.           Do you believe this shit?          Annie is still staring at the sign.           That's a big cookie huh.           Where?          They point to the “sign”. Annie walks closer to see it is          indeed a huge cookie.           See. Sugar cookie.                                                                                                               Leslie takes a piece off, eats it.           It's even better if you dip it in the          chocolate.          REVEAL a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain. Girls          are around it dipping strawberries and pieces of the big          cookie, laughing. Helen is there taking their praise.          Annie is pissed and plops her tupperware of cookies on a          nearby table.           Annieee!!!          Lillian runs to her.           (under her breath) Can you believe this?           Lillian!           Coming Mom! I gotta go say hi to my          aunts.          She leaves and Helen appears out of nowhere again.           Hi Annie!           Beautiful party.           Oh, it's nothing....so...Just make          yourself at home. Enjoy!           Thanks. (under her breath) Asshole.           What did you say?           I said I love this shower, and i's          amazing. I said all that.          Annie leaves. Two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets          approach Helen and jam out in her face.                                                                                                                OK, not me, NOT ME! The GUESTS. Hip hop          dance with the GUESTS!           looking.           Annie puts lotion her hands. She sees a magazine photo of           face super imposed over them. On the counter is a framed          photo of Helen, soft lit, posed with her hand gently           face. She also sees a photo of Helen and Lillian from          Vegas on the plane. Happy.          As Annie leaves, she runs into her Mom, wh's new          hairstyle is a bit overdone.           Mom. Hi!          They hug.           Wow! You look great.           Thank you sweetheart. (to herself) I wish          Barb could see me now.           Not today Mom.           You're right. Well I'm happy to see you!          I'll see you out there. I need to wash          the horse off my hands.          Mom goes into the bathroom. Megan approaches.           Annie, did you see the party favors?           I'm sure they're perfect and amazing.           They're dogs!                                                                                                                What?           Yeah. And they're wrapped up like          presents. They said we have to wait until          we leave but I cant stop thinking about          them. I gotta go tell Lillian.           Annie now stands next to the chocolate fountain. She          looks around, drops her glass in it and unplugs it with          her foot. It stops flowing. She looks around and throws          some leaves in it and walks away.            attention by microphone.           Hello ladies. Bonjour. (french          sentence)Yay! Welcome. I am your host          Helen, a bridesmaid in Lillian's wedding.          I want you all to have a wonderful time.          Eat, drink, please have some cookie!          She laughs and then becomes very serious.           Lillian. Today's your day. I'd like to          make a beautiful toast, “You are pretty,          fun, sweet, look at all of your friends.          Girlpower!” Everyone enjoy your lunch,          served along with the musical stylings          of...The LILLIANETTE'S!!!          A quartet, all in pink and white and harmonize. ‘Lillian,          Lillian, Lillian, Lillian! When Lillian was a little          girl...”          Judy claps and enjoys the music. She leans over to Annie.           I don't know what's going on honey.          The shower is a hit.                                                                                                                Everyone sits surrounded by decorations, pictures of          Dougie and Lillian as babies, flowers, fire in the          fireplace.           Everyone it's game time! Please take your          piece of paper, put it on top of your          head, and with your other hand try to          draw what Lillian and Dougie's first baby          is going to look like!!! Ready? GO!          Everyone draws, giggles, looks at their stupid drawings,          laughing. Annie cheats and draws it on her lap.            And the winner is...Annie?          Dana holds up a perfectly realistic drawing of a baby.           Yeah, that's mine. Thank you.           Girls spin a blind-folded 86 year old ELLIE around 3          times, Then they swing her holding her hands and feet.           One... two...three!          Annie looks confused. They throw Ellie onto a huge pile          of pillows. This is a terrible game.           Find the veil! C'mon Ellie! Come on Look!          You can do it! It's right there!          Ellie feels around in the huge pile of pillows. She finds          the veil, holds it up in victory and then falls down from          dizziness.           YAAAAY! YOU DID IT! WoooHoo!                                                                                                                 #9. What is Lillian's favorite ice cream          flavor? Write it down...quickly.           (under her breath, to the woman next to          her) Ew. Kinda smells funny in here.          Doesn't it? Smells bad. This house has a          weird smell.           OK, last one. For the big prize. #10.          What is the craziest place Lillian and          Dougie....?          Helen strongly hints with a weird smile instead of          saying, “...had sex?” Shower Girls Ooooh and Ahhhh.           (under her breath) Wow, looks like          someone's a pervert. It's none of my          business. She's gross.            (very emotional) I'm putting a blue bead          on this “advice necklace” to represent          the ocean. It may not always be smooth          sailing but you can ride the waves          together.          Dana cries and takes a picture. Everyone applauds,           (to person near her) The ocean's are          really polluted right now. Its not          something to joke about.           Lillian opens presents in front of huge photograph of          herself.           Oh! My towels! Thank you Dana.           I just wanted to get you something you          could use everyday and something pretty.          Dana takes a picture, Lillian grabs another box, giddy.                                                                                                                Annie. (opens it) Oh, our mugs! Thank you          Annie.           Well, you registered for 'em so thank          yourself, you picked them out. I did't          do anything...           This one's from me.          Helen hands Lillian her gift. Lil opens it and holds up          beautiful lingerie.           Oooo/Ahhhhh etc.           Ooh, brothel gear...           (sotto] It's disgusting. Here Mom's here.           Wait, what's this?          Lillian pulls out an envelope.           (sotto) Wow, cash. Kinda tacky.          Lillian opens the envelope.           Oh my God. Helen.          Lillian holds up the tickets.           Honey what are they?           Two first class tickets to Sea World.          How did you--           Are you fucking kidding me?           Annie!                                                                                                                  Annie! What is going on with you?           Nothing have fun at Sea World.           Why don't we go in the other room and--           Shut up you ridiculous person, you a          sneaky little cream and white cashmere--.           Annie. Everyone I am so sorry, I really          don't know what you mean.           I think you do.(laughs) Horses?          Sculptures? Posters? Look at this stupid          house! This stupid marshmallow puffy          furniture! (pointing outside) And look at          that cookie! Would you please everyone!          Speaking of that cookie. I never got a          piece!          Annie marches into the back yard.           (shouting, we see her through the large           Did you honestly think 30 women were          gonna finish this?! You know what!? 'll          help you out!          She tries to take down the cookie and struggles with it.          We watch her from the house. Fall over with the cookie,          she runs over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip          it over, it's obviously too heavy. She tries to empty it          with her hands onto the ground.           Mmmmm. Nothing says friendship like a          thousand gallons of hot unsanitary          chocolate! Hello swan, are you having          fun? Did you enjoy the hip-hop dancers?                                                                                                               Everyone is watching Annie. She is fighting and punching          the air like a crazy person, chasing a swan. A little          girl starts crying.          Annie walks back through the house, through the crowd          holding her chocolate covered hands in the air.           I actually thought I wanted to be like          you...and you and YOU, to be a part of          this world. That's not who I am. I make          bad choices. I'm broke, I lost my stupid          job, I'm thirty two years old and I still          answer booty calls. I don't like Mike          Donahue cause he () on our date. I have          a single black hair that grows out of my          chin and I can't wear white t-shirts          cause something about my sweat turns the          pits yellow! AND you know when we were in          Vegas? When you were all staying at your          luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK          where got BODY LICE! So Helen, you can          have the coveted Maid of Honor title. You          can have it all wrapped up in a big pink          obnoxious musical box! Because all its          brought me is a big pain in my ass.          Congratulations!          Annie leaves and Lillian runs after her.           Annie stop! I don't know what's going on.           Well let me fill you in. Ever since you          got engaged, my life has turned to shit.           I'm sorry the the happiest time in my          life has brought you so much misery. Do          you know how selfish that sounds?           I'm selfish? You're the one that's been          so wrapped up in all this. Designer          dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower,          this is not you!           This is my wedding and you've made it all          about you.                                                                                                                Well at least my friendship's not for          sale.          This hangs in the air. Annie storms off. Lillian storms          back inside.           Do you think she still has body lice?           Anyone else?! Anyone else have something          they wanna say to me?!          Dana can't contain herself.           I got my chin done!          Becca stands up.           Kevin smokes pot!          Leslie stands up.           I'm pregnant!          Megan stands up.           I took two dogs already. There in the          back of my van!           Annie is pissed. She sees a squirrel in the road (close          up of squirrels big eyes). She tries to avoid it, slams          on her breaks and BOOM! Annie is rear-ended! The driver          behind her backs up, peels out and drives away.           Thank you!          Her car won't start. Trying to keep it together, she          grabs her running shoes from the back seat and storms          down the highway, trying not to cry.          A cop car pulls next to her. I's Rhodes.                                                                                                                Rhodes is looking under her hood.           Well, I can't say I'm surprised.           Yes. Taillights. I know!           You should've taken it to my friend-           I KNOW! Yes, you're friend! But I didn't          ok?! I didn't get them fixed! I don't--           Whoa. Don't take it out on me. This is          your fault.           HE hit ME!           You had no taillights! You did't get          them fixed! You don't get to blame anyoe          else. It's your fault.          Annie starts to walk away.           Where you going?!          Annie keeps walking.           Oh, you're going to walk fifteen miles?!          Another WISE decision!            What do you know?!!           I know that you not taking responsibility          is why we're standing out here! YOU did          not make an effort to fix that problem.          This hits Annie. Rhodes is physically worked up.                                                                                                                     Why are you yelling at me?!           It's dangerous! You're putting your life,          and others in danger!           I'm! Sorry!          He calms down.           Look, all I know, is that you're kinda          crazy. You're always stressed out or          late, complaining about something, and          now you're yelling at me! And for some          reason, all I've ever wanted to do is ask          you on a date.           Well save yourself the trouble, and          don't.           Yeah, I'm not much of a hickey guy          anyway.          Annie remembers her hickey. He saw it?!           Well, I have said “no” anyway.           Well, then you have yourself a good night          ma'am.          Annie regrets that. He drives away leaving her there. She          is alone.           Annie's car gets towed into the shop.                                                                                                                BILL enters with a clip board. He is a stocky Milwaukee          good guy.           Rhodes told me a while back you might be          stopping in. I'm Bill Cozbi.           Oh, hi.           I was beginning to think we'd never see          ya.           Yeah, I know. I'm irresponsible.           Nah, no one likes taking care of that          stuff. But you are going to have to leave          your car here for a week or so.           A week?            So you kind of had a bad time at the          wedding shower?           Yes I did. Everything's just...          She starts crying. Steve hands her a tissue from the          middle console.           I'm sorry, I just--this has been a really          shitty day.           Yeah. Ok, don't get mad at me, but it          seems like you have a lot of those.           Yes I do! Right? Thank you.                                                                                                                Have you considered the idea that maybe,          possibly, perhaps, it's you that makes          them shitty?          Annie stares at him.           I'm just saying, maybe it's your          attitude.           This is not about attitude. It's just the          facts! My life hasn't turned it out the          way I expected. I don't have any of          those things that gives a person points          in the world.           I think that might be your problem. I          think you read too many of those          magazines. You don't need things to be          someone. Tyra said that. Tyra Banks.           Annie sits on the couch with Steve in a daze, watching           Lillian. She doesn't even know what to say, so she          doesn't answer.            Annie reads a shitty magazine at the counter. She turns          to see the gray-haired, outdoorsy WOMAN that she and          Lillian pointed out.           Is anyone sitting here?           No.          The lady sits next to Annie and smiles at her.                                                                                                                 Annie looks in the classifieds. A lot say “college          degree required.” She looks up and sees TED has walked          in.           Hey Annie.           Oh, hey Ted. You're in town.           Yeah, yeah. Listen I'm going out tonight          but I should be home around 11, you wanna          come over?           Really? Ok, sure.          Ted smiles at her. Annie stops herself.           Wait no. No. No. I don't think I do.          Because answering your booty calls and          having you kick me out after a night of          no-strings-attached sex doesn't feel          good. NO girls feel good after that and          if they say they do they're LYING. But          it's not your fault. Its me. It's me.          Have a great life. And you can keep the          plant.          Annie grabs her stuff and leaves.           She lies on her bed staring at the ceiling. She picks up          the phone.           Lillian's phone lights up, it's on silent. She is           names cut out and being placed at different tables. Her          mom, Laurie, Helen, and two women argue about the seating          chart. Lillian looks distraught.                                                                                                                Annie sadly hangs up.           TIM, the owner is sitting with Annie.           Well, I can't think of anything else to          tell you. Did you have any questions?           No, I think we've covered everything. I'm          really excited and thank you.          Annie gathers her things.           I'll see you next Monday. What time do I          start?           Four a.m.          Annie is a little surprised. Ti's smiling.           You'll get used to it.          Annie smiles back.           I won't be late.           Oh and I wanna try one of those moonpies.           (smiling] Yeah. Ok.           Annie weaves through the crowded hallway, approaches a          window.                                                                                                                Hi, I'm here to inquire about financial          aid.          Her cell phone rings.           Take these to the second window.           I'm sorry?          Annie's trying to find her phone.           The second window.           Thanks.          It's too late, she looks at her phone. It was Lillian. No          message. She doesn't call her back.           Annie gets out of Steve's car.            Parts and labor, we're lookin' at eight          hundred dollars. But with your          discount...           Discount?           Yeah. Rhodes and I worked out a deal way          back when, so, this one's on the house.           Are you serious?           Yep. I owe him big time. He runs          background checks on all the guys my          daughter dates. There's been a lot of          'em.                                                                                                                You're kidding! If you see him, would          you thank him for me and tell him that          I'm crazy and I'm sorry. He'll know what          you mean.           Annie drives past Rhodes' at his post, flicking her brand          new taillights. He sees her, but does't respond.           pull her over. She drives by him again and swerves all          over the road. He really wants to pull her over, but he          doesn't. She goes back one more time, throws a bunch of          trash and diet coke cans out of the window. He still          ignores her. She gives up and goes home.          't get          to this point until this morning. wanted to see if we're          going in the right direction with annie uniting          bridesmaids and saving the day.           Annie and Steve are in the kitchen, sh's cooking. Steve          reads out of the college brochure.           Ok, you can take Women's Studies or          Spanish...oooh The History of Wine.          The phone rings.           Hello?           Annie. It's Megan, Becca Leslie, Dana and          Helen.           Oh. Hi--            Lillian's missing!                                                                                                                What do you mean she's missing?           We were all supposed to get spray-tans          today and she never showed up. No on's          heard from her. She could be anywhere,          doing anything! She could be ANYWHERE--           Jesus Christ, give me the God damn phone.          Leslie grabs the phone from Megan.           Annie, it's Leslie. Look, I'm sure it's          nothing to worry about. The weddin's the          day after tomorrow, she's been really          stressed, so she just probably freaked          out and went somewhere. We just want to          find her and probably talk her off a          ledge. Any ideas?           Um, gosh I..I don't know. Um, I'll come          to you guys. I'll be there in an hour and          45 minutes. I wanna help.          Annie hangs up, grabs her keys. She stops, comes back and          grabs a small paper bag, and runs out the door.           What about the Science of Jazz?           Annie pulls over. She puts the piece of paper in the          small paper bag. She gets out of the car, leaving it          running. A few seconds later she comes back without the          bag. Takes a deep breath and drives away.            Maybe she's at the park.           The park? Don't be stupid Dana.           Jeez, take it easy.                                                                                                                Well, it's closed is all I'm just saying.           Maybe she flew somewhere. Everyone always          hides in Mexico.           I don't think she'd leave the country.          Maybe she went to the reservoir.           Why would she go to the reservoir? Its          just a big tank of water.           Ernie and I sometimes go for our morning          walk there. It's the next best thing to a          lake.           Oh my God! I think I know where she is.           The girls drive on a dark road.           How much further?           We're almost there.           I'm think I'm getting carsick.           Is that supposed to be a dig on my          driving?           Well you do speed up and slow down a lot.           Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't take a stunt          driving course in Renegade missions.           Why do you always have to be so          condescending?                                                                                                                Yeah, its getting really old.           I was being funny!           Well it came out a little mean Helen.           Dana who's side are you on?          All the girls start yelling. Helen loses control of the          car for a split second and drives off the road hitting          something. BOOM! The girls scream!!! She pulls over. All          the girls are wide eyed and speechless.           What was that?           Did we hit something!?           Was it a person?           Guys it's just a flat. I've gotten tons          of them.          Annie goes to get out of the car.           No!/ Annie don't get out!/ It's pitch          dark out.           Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911.           You don't call 911 for a flat tire!          A huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit.          The girls SCREAM!           Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards          on.          Helen puts them on.                                                                                                                I'm calling AAA.           I'm calling Kevin!           Helen, do you have a jack?           Probably?!           What if we get hit just sitting here? Or          kidnapped or chased by an animal?           Dana calm down.           Shit! I don't have any service.           Me neither!           Oh my God! We're gonna die...          Annie has had enough and gets out.          The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele's trunk,          lifts the bottom (wherever the jack is in an Escalade]          She goes up to the window.            Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me          to fix this.          They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do.          Annie puts the jack under car.           So, how can I help?           Hold the flashlight.          Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She          really does know what she's doing! The car is raising.                                                                                                                Megan hand me the wrench.          Megan hands it to her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug          nuts handing them to Megan, with Leslie by her side.          Dana and Becca stand with Helen.           That's pretty cool she knows how to do          change a tire.           I know. I can't believe she's doing it.          Dana and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone.           Just don't scratch anything.          The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe.           So what are you doing now?           I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take          the tire off.           How does that little thing lift the whole          car?           It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human          being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to          three tons.           How do you know this stuff?           I like cars. There's a real artistry to          them.           Are you guys working or talking? We do't          have all night.           (quickly) Annie is doing the best she can          Helen. So why don't you just stand over          there and be quiet and wait.                                                                                                               Everyone's speechless.           Excuse me?!          Dana stands. She has had it with Helen.           I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck          up!!!??          Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now.           Lillian probably left because of you          anyway.           What!?           You're so- bossy! You've been acting like          you're in charge this whole time! Do't          you realize how much pressure sh's          under? You know, Lillian did not want to          leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn          carriage?! She said “That's not me.” And          you ordered it anyway! You've been          pushing her this whole time! Annie was          right.           Yeah!          Helen glares at Megan.           What are you talking about? The only          reason you're even in this wedding is          because you're the groom's sister.          Weirdo.           I'd rather be the groom's sister than          have cameltoe from my $600 pants.          We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has surprised them.           Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn't          the one who caused a huge scene at          Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry.                                                                                                               Everyone looks at Annie.           I hate to interrupt this riveting          discussion but a really creepy guy in a          Trans Am just pulled over.          The guy gets out of the car. He is thirty-ish, wears at-          shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts.           Hey it's pretty late. What are you ladies          doing?          Becca and Dana scramble into the woods. Leslie gets          behind the car.           Just changing the tire.           You guys need some man hands for that?           Nope I think we got it. But thank you.          He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other.           Look, if you guys get tired, I live right          up that hill. You ladies can just leave          your car here, come on up and let us all          lay down together.          He starts to walk toward them. The girls are scared.          Annie gives Megan a look. Megan tries to distract him.           Hey! Are those snowflake rims?          The guy looks at Megan.           Yeah, found ‘em in a junk yard. Restored          ‘em myself.           I bet you got a formula 4OO under there?           Well, well. Someone knows her cars.                                                                                                                I'm in the Firebird club.           You don't say. I never met a lady in the          FBC before.          He walks over to Megan, she gives Annie a nod. Annie          rushes to the tire and quickly continues changing it.           You ever make it up to the Trans Am          Nationals in Dayton?          Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together. They          talk in a loud whisper.           What's happening? What's happening?           I can hear animals.           Be quiet!          The guy is moving closer to Megan.           Remember Smokey and the Bandit?           It's my favorite movie. “Give me a Diablo          sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and make it          quick . I'm in a goddamn hurry.”          He leans into her.           Why don't you show me what's under the          hood?          Back at Helen's car. Leslie sneaks over to Annie.           How's it comin'?           Almost there.          The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking. He          puts his hands on her ass.                                                                                                                You wanna get in the backseat?           Uh...          He is really getting aggressive, pushing against her.           Hey take it easy!           Hey what about me?          He turns around to be hit with a huge piece of wood by          Helen. He falls.           Oh my God!!          Annie is frantically releasing the jack.           OK, everybody in the car! Get in! Megan,          Helen let's go!          All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it. Annie          is finishing.           Hey you!           Annie get in!           I'm gonna get you bitches!!          He is coming towards Annie! She turns towards him with          the jack.           Back away! Or I will shove this Jack so          far down your throat you will shit          out...your fucking..face!           Whoa, whoa. Alright. Alright. I'm          leaving.           Get out!                                                                                                                I am! I live up the hill though if you          change your mind.          Annie backs up and jumps in the car. Helen peels away.          The girls drive away fast.           The girls still driving. Megan's eating chips.           Megan I was freaked out when he leaned up          against you. That was a pretty gutsy          move.           Annie's the one who tried to make him eat          a car jack.           Helen hit him over the head with a tree.          They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile.           There it is, turn left up here. Go down          the little hill. Ok, that's the driveway.          It's dark and very rustic. It's LILLIAN'S LAKE HOUSE FROM          THE FLASHBACK. Where Lillian and Dougie met.           God I haven't been here in forever.           The house is right up here.          They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car.           Her car's not here.           Doesn't look like any lights are on.           She's not here.          Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated.                                                                                                                I thought she'd be here. I really thought          she'd be here. I'm sorry.           Annie, it's ok.           No, it's not. I don't know what happened.          I messed everything up. Lillia's not          even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid          to see what's really happening.          Lillian's moving on to this great life          and I feel left behind. And know matter          how hard I try, I don't fit in to her          life now.          Everyone is silent.           Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I          haven't made things easy for you.. I          don't have a life and I am bored. Perry          is always away and I'm constantly alone          and she's been there. And I've been a          bridesmaid nine times and although I may          have implied it, I....I've never been a          Maid of Honor. I wanted to make          everything special for Lillian because...          I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted          her to like me better and to impress her,          and everyone else. And I'm just good at          throwing parties. I always have been. In          fact sometimes I think people only ask me          to be in their wedding's because of that.           Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked          you to be in her wedding it's because you          are her friend. Trust me.          Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled          by the flash.           I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets.           I'm sorry that when I left the shower I          told your neighbors you were shooting a          porn.                                                                                                                Oh, I didn't know that you did that.           Oh, well, sorry.           I deserved it.           I must say you do put on some pretty          spectacular events.           Well, I'm really rich.          They smile.           It is getting pretty late.           What should we do about Lillian?           She'll come home when she's ready.           Annie enters exhausted to find Lillian sitting against          her door. Annie walks up and slides down to sit next to          her. After a minute.           You okay?           Yeah. Didn't mean to make anyone worry.           It's okay. I really am sorry.           I'm sorry too. I didnt want things to          turn out like this. I got so caught up in          the frenzy of everything, wanting this          one day to be perfect.           Well its easy to get caught up.                                                                                                                And it doesnt help that all my friends          hate eachother.           I'm sorry. But it's all good now. We all          talked and everythings cool.           Really?!           Yup, Helen and I are best friends now.          We're going shopping for cream sweaters          tomorrow.           She's really not so bad.           I know.           I just wish the wedding hadnt become          about everything and everyone else but me          and Dougie. And now, it's become this          thing I never wanted. I did want simple.          I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights          and food everywhere. I wanted a DJ to          play all those stupid wedding songs.           It's not too late to have those things.           I'm sorry I didn't know all the stuff you          were going through too.          Annie is clearly sad.           It's fine. I just feel really lost right           Lillian hugs her.           Nothing's going to change.           Oh God dont say that.                                                                                                                I mean between you and me.           You want to come in? Steve's home. This          could be your last chance as a single          woman.           Ooooo...           The small paper bag sits on the side of the road. Cop car          pulls up. This is Rhodes' spot, we've seen before. He          gets out and walks over to it, confused. He picks it up          and it says, “Officer Rhodes”. He's a little weary but          opens it and pulls out a note. “I hear you like          moonpies.” He looks in the bag and smiles.           Becca and Kevin are slow dancing happily very much in          love.          Leslie and Paul dancing with two boys trying to join in.          They are all happy, he rubs her stomach.          Perry and Helen are dancing. They look like they are          talking and working things out. He hugs her and kisses          her.          Lillian and Dougie dance into frame. They are very close.          Smiling and kissing. They've never looked happier. She          smiles at someone. It's Annie.          Annie is watching everyone from the side, smiling also.          Steve approaches.           Thanks a lot for bringing me.           Thanks for coming with me.          Megan appears on her other side.           Yeah, thanks for bringing him.                                                                                                               Megan winks at Steve, he grabs her hand and they go to          dance.          Annie is alone, watching everybody. We see the wedding as          a whole. It's a beautiful event. Colored lanterns,          twinkly lights, food everywhere. Simple, fun...very          Lillian.           Annie and Lillian walking out of the reception.           So when does school start?           A week. I'm scared. I'm gonna be the          oldest one there.           So what? Now you can have an affair with          your teacher and it won't be gross.          They walk down the steps.           Thanks for everything today. Yo've been          the best Maid of Honor ever.           Really?           (kidding) MMM. No. That's not true at          all. You were pretty terrible. Today you          were good.          Annie sees the hotel shuttle.           Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to          the hotel.           You're always gonna be my best friend.          They hug goodbye. She runs down the stairs.           I will see YOU in a couple weeks Mrs.          Price!                                                                                                               Lillian waves goodbye and turns to go back inside. Annie          runs towards the shuttle.          She's too late. The shuttle drives away without her. She          JUST missed it.           Wait! Wait! Stop! Great. Of course.          The shuttle is gone, but there's something that was on          the other side of it.           Need a ride ma'am?          It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen          candles. Annie is all smiles and walks up to him.           How did you know I was here?           It was really complicated. I remembered          the name of this place, I called them up,          told them I was a cop calling on official          police business, doing a very big          investigation and uh, made them tell me          all the weddings they had planned for the          next two months with a bride named          Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop]          Annie smiles.           Wow.          They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.           So, did you get the moonpies?           Yes I did.           Did you like' em?           Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were          completely covered in ants.           Ooo, I didn't think about that.                                                                                                                You probably should have put it in a          plastic wrap or maybe a foil or          something. Tupperware would've worked but          then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm          gonna kiss you right now so...          He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about          to kiss.          Rhodes stops.           I didn't want to miss my chance again.            Me neither.          They MAKE OUT.          The end.           Annie is walking back to her hotel. A cop car pulls up          next to her.           Need a ride ma'am?          She turns to see Rhodes driving slowly next to her.           How did you know I was here?           I'm a cop.          They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.           So, did you get the moonpies?           Yes I did.           Did you like' em?           Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were          completely covered in ants.                                                                                                                Ooo, I didn't think about that.           The real reason I came here today is that          I have something that belongs to you.          He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot. She smiles.          He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door. She gets          in. They drive off into the sunset.

Weber                                                                               Based on the novel by                                  John Green                                                                                                            May 1, 2012           HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at          the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:            You have a choice in this world, I           believe, about how to tell sad           stories.          CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:          - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS ""GUS""          WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.          [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]            On the one hand, you can sugar coat           - the way they do in movies and           romance novels.          - ""Perfect"" Hazel and ""Perfect"" Gus sit on a BENCH          overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.          She rests her head on his shoulder.            Where villains are vanquished           and... heroes are born and...          - ""Perfect"" Hazel and ""Perfect"" Gus kiss in a dark room.            ... beautiful people learn           beautiful lessons...          - ""Perfect"" Hazel and ""Perfect"" Gus fall onto a bed together.          They look deep into one another's eyes.            ... and nothing is too messed up           that can't be fixed with an apology           and a Peter Gabriel song.          BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were          those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.            I like that way as much as the next           girl, believe me. It's just not the           truth.          Hazel closes her eyes.            This is the truth.          And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:            Sorry.                                      The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.            Late in the Winter of my 17th           year...          There are, however, some key and obvious differences.          First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which          help her to breathe.          Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the          grass. It's much shorter than the ""Perfect"" version, the          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few          years before.            ... my mother decided I was           depressed.            I'm not depressed.          Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her          mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains          to the DOCTOR:            ... she eats like a bird. She           barely leaves the house,            I'm not depressed.            ... she reads the same book over           and over...            She's depressed.            I'm not depressed!          Off her look, CUT TO:          QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over:            The booklets and web sites always           list depression as a side effect of           cancer...          - A SHOPPING MALL. Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping,          laughing - being teenage girls, basically. And here's Hazel.          With her Mom. And her oxygen tank. Just another day.                                      Depression's not a side effect of           cancer...          - HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the          middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A          glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.          Hazel eyes them with indifference.            ... it's a side effect of dying.          - A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily          underlined copy of a novel (""An Imperial Affliction"" by Peter          Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of          delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his          shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat          - goes back to the book.            Which is what was happening to me.          And we CUT BACK TO:                                    Frannie continues to talk to the doctor. Hazel continues to          dangle her feet.            ... some days she won't even get           out of bed.          The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking.            I may switch you to Zoloft. Or           Lexapro. And twice a day instead of           once.            Why stop there?            Hmm?            Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm           like the Keith Richards of cancer           kids.          The Doctor looks at Frannie who just shakes her head.            Have you been going to that Support           Group I suggested?          Instead of answering, Hazel looks at her Mom.                                      She's gone a few times.            I'm not sure it's for me.            If you're depressed --             I'm not de--             -- support Groups are a great way           to connect with people who are...            What?             On the same journey.            ""Journey?"" Really?            Hazel.            Just give it a chance, ok? For me.          Hazel rolls her eyes, knows she's lost this battle.            Who knows? You might even find           it... enlightening.                                     CLOSE UP on PATRICK (30s, pony-tail). He has a guitar.            ... we are gathered here today -           literally - in the heart of Jesus.          ANGLE on Hazel who just shakes her head. This is the lamest          thing she could be doing right now.            Who would like to share their story           with the group?          The basement is filled with SICK PEOPLE. Hazel among them.          Most are under the age of 18. QUICK CUTS:                                      Jillian. 15. Lymphoma.            Angel. 17. Ewing sarcoma.            Patrick. 34. Testicular. It started           a few years ago, when I was...          As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear:            I'll spare you the gory details of           Patrick's ball cancer. Basically,           they found it in his nuts, cut most           of it out, he almost died, but he           didn't die, and now here he is -           divorced, friendless, addicted to           video games, exploiting his           cancertastic past in the heart of           Jesus - ""literally"" - to show us           that one day - if we're lucky - we           could be just like him.          They all say:            ""We're here for you Patrick.""          Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with          her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye          patch, ISAAC. He's also shaking his head.            Who else would like to share?            Hazel?          Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she          stands, sighs...            I'm, uh, Hazel. 16.            Thyroid originally but with quite           the impressive satellite colony in           my lungs.          Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down.            And how are you doing Hazel?          Hazel has no idea how to answer that.            You mean besides the terminal           cancer?                                    But that's not what she says. She says:            Alright? I guess...?          Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down.            ""We're here for you Hazel.""          Hazel exhales. This is not at all helpful. A few more beats.            Maybe now I'll play a song...                                    Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a          book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door          open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out. Frannie looks          at her like ""well, was it great?"" Hazel just exhales and gets          in the car. CUT TO:                                    ""America's Next Top Model"" is on the TV. Hazel sits on one          side of the L-shaped couch, flipping through her novel.          Frannie and Hazel's dad MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his best to          stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but          trying not to make it seem that way. After a few beats:            It's Friday night.            Hmm?            I was just thinking... you should           call your friends, see what they're           up to.             That's ok.          Frannie and Michael look at one another, don't say anything.            Wanna see a movie?          Hazel looks up from the book. Sees her parents. Gets an idea.            Why don't you guys go to a movie?           (off their look)              You haven't been out in a while.           Go. Have fun. Take the night off.          Frannie and Michael look at one another again.            This is a really good show.          Hazel sighs. And just like that, everyone goes back to what          they were doing. CUT TO:          QUICK SEQUENCE, which plays over:            And that was my life.          - Hazel watching TV, book in hand.          - Hazel in another doctor's office.          - Hazel popping pills.            Reality shows. Doctor's           appointments. Eight prescription           drugs, three times a day.                                    Hazel and her parents in the kitchen.            And worse worse worst of all...           support group.            Ugh. You can't make me.            Of course we can, we're your           parents.          Hazel frowns.            Hazel, you need to get out of the           house. Make friends. Be a teenager.            If you want me to be a teenager,           don't send me to Support Group. Buy           me a fake ID so I can go to clubs           and drink gimlets and take pot.            You don't take pot.                                      See, that's the kind of thing I           would know with a fake ID.             Get in the car.          Hazel mock stabs herself in the stomach with an invisible          sword. CUT TO:                                    A small Episcopalian sanctuary in suburban Indianapolis.            And so I went...          Frannie's car pulls up close to the back entrance.            Not because I wanted to or because           I thought it would help. But for           the same reason I did anything           these days...          Hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with Frannie's          assistance.            ... to make my parents happy.            Are you gonna sit here and wait the           whole time?            Of course not, no. I...           (she totally is)           I have errands to run.          Hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands. She          doesn't press the issue.            Ok.            Love you.            Love you too Mom.            The only thing worse than biting it           from cancer - is having a kid bite           it from cancer.          As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:                                      Make some friends!          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:                                    Hazel walks towards the elevator. An EXTREMELY SICK LOOKING          KID holds it open for her. Hazel thinks better of it.            I'll take the stairs.          The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded - it could          always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into:                                    Ooph. Sorry!                                   A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS).          Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue          eyes. Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life.           My bad. No, it's...                                   For a brief moment, the Earth stops. They stand looking at          one another. Hazel is speechless.            Excuse me.          With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face,          Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:                                    Hazel catches her breath. Shakes her head. Surprised at          herself.          She looks in the mirror. So doesn't like what she sees. The          Earth starts moving again. CUT TO:                                    Hazel sits in the Circle of Sick.            Who would like to begin?          No volunteers. Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy,          sitting next to Isaac. He seems to be watching her, that same          flirty smile on his face. She self-consciously looks away.                                      Isaac, I know you're facing a           challenging time. Perhaps you would           like to say something...          Isaac nods, rises.            Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye           cancer.            It's looking like another surgery           in a couple weeks. After which,           well, I'll be blind...          Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac's saying but it's          difficult. She still feels the Beautiful Boy's gaze on her.            Not that I'm complaining or           anything. I know a lot of you have           it way worse but, still, I mean,           you know, being blind's gonna           suck...          As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn't look away from          Hazel. Hazel finds this intimidating. And intimidation          irritates her. So she decides to play the game with him,          meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly.          A staring contest.            ...My girlfriend helps. And friends           like Augustus here...          Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -          AUGUSTUS. He still doesn't look away from Hazel.            So... yeah. That's what's up.            ""We're here for you Isaac.""          The staring contest continues another few beats until:            And does your friend want to speak?          This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away. Aha,          he's lost the contest! Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up          as if to say ""Victory is mine!"" He smiles back at her, the          most radiant smile on the planet. He turns back to the Group.            Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a           touch of osteosarcoma bout a year           and a half ago - lost this baby as           a result...                                    Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.            But really I'm just here at Isaac's           request.            And how are you feeling Augustus?            Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller           coaster that only goes up, my           friend.          Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops          smiling and looks away.            Perhaps you'd like to share your           fears with the group, Augustus.            My fears?          Gus thinks about this.            Oblivion.            Oblivion?          ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued.            Yeah, see... I intend to live an           extraordinary life. To be           remembered. If I'm scared of           anything it's... not doing that.          Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.            Would, uh, anyone like to speak to           that?          And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.            Hazel! That's unexpected.          Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus          watches her, waits for it.            I just wanna say... there will come           a time when, you know, all of us           are dead.          Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.                                      It might be tomorrow. Might be a           million years from now but... it's           gonna happen. And when it does,           enough generations will come and           go, there'll be no one left to           remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or           Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,           right?          The look on Gus's face is unreadable.            Oblivion's inevitable. And if that           scares you, well, I suggest you           ignore it. God knows it's what           everyone else does.          A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face,          not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:                                    Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear.          Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a          redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow          against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between          kisses, we can hear:           Always. Always.                                   And Hazel hears:            Literally.          Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing          right next to her.            I thought we were in a church           basement but apparently we were           literally in the heart of Jesus.          Hazel smiles.            Someone should probably tell him,           don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda           dangerous keeping all these kids           with cancer in your heart.          Gus laughs.            What's your name?                                      Hazel.            No your full name?             Hazel Grace Lancaster.          Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her.            What?            I didn't say anything.            Why are you looking at me like           that?            Because you're beautiful.          Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before.            I enjoy looking at beautiful people           and I decided a while back not to           deny myself the simpler pleasures           of existence. Particularly given           that, as you so astutely pointed           out, we're all gonna die pretty           soon.             I'm not beaut --          A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them.            Hey Gus.            Hey Alisa.          Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course          they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at          each other. She hears:                                    Always. Always.                                     What's with the ""always?""                                      ""Always"" is their thing. They'll           ""always"" love each other and           whatnot. Must have texted ""always""           to each other at least four million           times this year.          They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac          squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn.            He's gotta be hurting her boob.            Let's watch a movie.          Hazel is again surprised.            Oh. Um. Uh...           (yes!)           Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this             No I mean now.            What?            Hmm?            What do you mean ""now?""            I've got a car.          He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident.            You could be an axe murderer.            There is that possibility.            Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk.          As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and          pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in          disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between          his lips.            Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're           kidding right?           (off his look)           You just ruined the whole thing!                                      Whole thing?            What, you think that's cool? Oh you           idiot! There's always a hamartia,           isn't there? And yours is - even           though you had FREAKING CANCER you           give money to a corporation for the           chance to acquire EVEN MORE           CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so           well.          As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on          his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing.            Let me tell you... not being able           to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.            Hamartia?          Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.            A fatal flaw.          Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still          etched on his face.            They don't hurt you unless you           light them.            Sorry?            I've never lit one.          Hazel turns back to him.            It's a metaphor. See? You put the           thing that kills you between your           teeth. But you don't give it the           power to do the killing.          Hazel is floored. And impressed.            Metaphor.          Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up.            Hi sweetheart. Ready for some           ""Model?""                                    Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as          anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom.            Can't tonight.           (off her confused look)           I've made plans with Augustus           Waters.          And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with          the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or          awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:                                    Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst          driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the          seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck          snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face.            I failed the test a couple times.            You don't say.            Most amputees can drive with no           problem but... yeah. Not me.            I'm surprised you have a license.            Tell me about it!          Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.            The fourth time I took the test...           it was going about how this is           going... and when it was over, the           instructor looks at me and goes,           ""your driving, while unpleasant...           is not technically unsafe.""            Aha. Cancer perk.            Total cancer perk.          A few beats of silence.            So what happened to you?          Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but          somehow this seems different.                                      I was 13 when they found it.          And as she speaks, we see it unfold. SMASH CUT TO:                                    13-YEAR OLD HAZEL has a biopsy.            Stage IV thyroid cancer.                                    13-YEAR OLD HAZEL on the operating table. It's a nightmare.            I had surgery first.                                    This poor little girl is taking a beating. And it's just          getting started.          - Radiation treatment.            Then Radiation...          - Having her head shaved by Frannie.            Then Chemo...          - With a PICC line in a chemo chair.            All of which worked for a while.          - A RADIOLOGIST looks at an X-ray. He's not pleased.            And then stopped working.          - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe.          Frannie runs her fingers through her hair. Dad calls 9-1-1.            And then my lungs started filling           up with water.          - In the ICU, her parents standing over her.            That should have been the end.                                      (through the tears)           Are you ready, sweetie?          14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can't keep it together any          longer. He completely breaks down.            But it wasn't.                                    The sun shines in the room. 14-year old Hazel eats ice chips,          the color has returned to her cheeks.            The antibiotics kicked in. They           drained the fluid from my lungs.           And in time I got better. Stronger.                                    Slightly older Hazel is getting more intravenous medication.          It's never ending.            I even found myself in an           experimental trial. You know the           ones that are famous in the           Republic of Cancervania for not           working.          - A SECOND RADIOLOGIST examines a second X-ray.            It's called Phalanxifor. Didn't           work in over 70 percent of patients           but, for some reason...          The Radiologist looks surprised.            ...it worked in me. They called it           ""The Miracle.""          And finally, BACK TO:                                    Gus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel. He was          impressed with her before. He's totally dazzled now.            Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly           grown since...              Of course my lungs still suck but,           theoretically, they could continue           to suck in just this way for, I           dunno, a while maybe.            Wow.            Yeah.            So are you back in school or...?            Can't.            Why not?            Got my GED.            A college girl! Well that explains           the aura of sophistication...          He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm          playfully. They're easing into each other.          Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway.            We're here.          He's as good at parking as he is at driving. CUT TO:                                    Hazel follows Gus inside. She quickly notices all sorts of          engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like ""Home is          Where the Heart Is"" and ""True Love is Born from Hard Times.""          Hazel looks at Gus quizzically.            My parents call them           ""encouragements.""           (rolling his eyes)           Don't ask.          Gus's MOM and DAD (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner.            Hey guys.            Augustus, hi. New friend?                                    Gus's parents don't seem surprised to see Gus with some          random girl in their house. Hazel takes note of that.            This is Hazel Grace.            It's just... Hazel.            How's it going, Just Hazel?             Downstairs if you need us!          Gus drags Hazel to the next room. As she's pulled:            Nice to meet you!          They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier          time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and          weak lungs.          Eventually they arrive at Gus's basement bedroom. There's a          TV with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole          host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school          trophies, framed images etc.) Gus sees her looking at them.            I used to play.            Must have been pretty good.            These are mine. And these. The rest           of it's just cancer perks.          Gus grabs a DVD from his stack of DVDs. Hazel sits down on          the bed, her breathing noticeably heavier.            Need to sit.          Gus sits down next to her on the bed.            Don't get any ideas.           (catching her breath)           All that standing... and stairs...           and then more standing... lotta           standing for me.            I understand.                                      I'll be fine in a minute. Unless I           faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian           lady, fainting-wise.          Gus smiles. He waits for her breathing to slow down. In time:            You ok?          Hazel nods, smiles.            So what's your story?            I already told you my story. I was             Not your cancer story. Your story.           Interests, hobbies, passions, weird           fetishes...            Um...            Don't tell me you're one of those           people who becomes their disease.            No. I'm just... I don't know... un-           extraordinary.            I reject that out of hand.           (beat, Hazel shrugs)           Think of something you love. First           thing that comes to mind.            ""An Imperial Affliction.""            Ok. What's that?            It's a novel. My favorite novel.            Does it have zombies?             What? No.            Stormtroopers.                                      Seriously?            It's not that kind of book.            Sounds horrible.            It's not, it's... kind of my bible           actually.            Interesting. What's it about?            Cancer.           (off his look)           But not in that way, trust me. The           guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten,           he's... well, the only person I've           ever come across who seems to a)           understand what it's like to be           dying and b) not have died.             In that case... I am going to read           this horrible book with the boring           title that does not contain zombies           or stormtroopers. And in           exchange...          Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf.            ... all I ask is that you read this           brilliant and haunting novelization           of my favorite video game.          Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. She laughs.          She's adorable when she laughs. She takes the book from him          and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a          brief, charged moment.            Your hands are cold.            Not so much cold as under-           oxygenated.            Ooh Hazel Grace...            I love it when you talk medical to           me.          Hazel blushes. And off her completely smitten smile, CUT TO:                                     Hazel sits in bed reading Gus's novella. Frannie stands in          the doorway, notices the new book.            That's different.          Hazel shrugs. Frannie looks intrigued.            Did he give it to you?            By ""it"" do you mean herpes?          Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel's phone buzzes. She excitedly          checks it - only to be disappointed. Frannie notices.            I'm sure he'll call, don't worry.            I'm not worried. Please. It's not           like I'm waiting for him to call or           anything. I just... we hung out. No           big deal.          Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel          rolls her eyes. CUT TO:           Hazel continues ""not to wait"" for Gus's call. We see her:          - Brushing her teeth. And checking her phone.          - Watching TV. And checking her phone.          - Eating breakfast. And checking her phone.          - Looking out the window on a rainy day. Trying not to check          her phone. Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone.          And checking the phone.          Where is he?! Did he forget about her?                                    Hazel at the dinner table with her parents. She's a little          sullen, barely touching her food.          Hazel's phone buzzes. She tries not to seem too eager to          check it, what with her parents watching and all. She subtly          looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her          eyes bug out. We see:                                    ""Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something.""          Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share          a quick glance. A second later, there's a follow-up text.          ""Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!""          Hazel smiles again.          And then a third text:            Hazel now laughs out loud. Michael clears his throat. Hazel          looks up.            Would you like to be excused?                                    Hazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone. Gus          answers on the first ring.            Hazel Grace.            Welcome to the sweet torture of           reading ""An Imperial --""          At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other          end of the phone.            What the -- are you ok?            Me? Yeah. I'm excellent.          INTERCUT between Hazel on the patio and:                                    Isaac's head is buried in Gus's couch. He's wailing like a          banshee, having some kind of nervous breakdown.             I am, however, with Isaac.          Hazel hears more wailing. Has no idea what to make of it.                                       Dude! Hey! Does Support Group Hazel           make this better or worse?          Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on.            Isaac! Focus. On. Me.          Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on. Finally:             How fast can you get here?          Hazel thinks about this. And on her face, CUT TO:                                    Hazel descends the steps. She hears an ungodly moan before          she sees anyone. What has she gotten herself into? Gus          appears at the base.            (calling to Isaac)           Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is           coming downstairs.          Gus waits for a response. None comes. He gestures for her to          follow him into the room. Before he does:            A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the           midst of a psychotic episode.            You look nice, by the way.          Hazel blushes, follows Gus into the room to find Isaac          sitting upside down in a gaming chair. Tears are flowing down          his reddened cheeks. Empty soda cans and bags of junk food          lie around him.            How ya doing Isaac?          Again, no response. Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation.            Seems Isaac and Monica are no           longer a going concern.            Oh I'm sorry.            Do you want to talk about it?          Isaac starts to sob again.                                      He just wants to cry and play video           games.            Fair enough.            It doesn't hurt to talk to him,           however. If you have any sage words           of feminine advice...            I actually think his response is           appropriate.            ""Pain demands to be felt.""            (lights up at that)           You're quoting my book!          Gus winks at her. At which point, Isaac lets out another          howl. Gus gestures for Hazel to sit. The two of them flank          Isaac. He finally speaks.            She didn't want to do it after the           surgery. Said she couldn't handle           it. I'm about to lose my eyesight           and she can't handle it.          Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.            I kept saying ""always"" to her.           Always, always, always. And she           just kept talking over me and not           saying it back. It was like I was           already gone, you know? ""Always""           was a promise! You can't break           promises.            Sometimes people don't understand           the promises they're making when           they make them.            Right, sure, but you keep the           promise anyway. That's what love           is. Love is keeping the promise           anyway.            That could be an ""encouragement.""          It's silent for a beat. And then Isaac stands up, a funny          look on his face.                                      Isaac...?          Suddenly Isaac starts kicking his chair across the room.            Here we go...          The chair lands against the bed. Gus hands Isaac something          else to throw, a pillow. Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it          against the wall. He dives on it and beings pummeling the          pillow like a maniac.            That's it! Punch that thing.          And so he does. As he continues to, Gus looks at Hazel,          cigarette dangling from his mouth.            I've been wanting to call you on a           nearly minutely basis but I have           been waiting until I could form a           coherent thought in re: ""An           Imperial Affliction.""            I can't stop thinking about it.            I know, right?            The only problem is the ending.            It is rather abrupt.            It's torture! I mean, I totally get           that she died or whatever - Anna.           But there is an unwritten contract           between author and reader and I           think ending your book in the           middle of a sentence kind of           violates that contract.            But that's part of what I like           about it. It portrays death           truthfully. You die in the middle           of your life, in the middle of a           sentence. But I do - God, I do want           to know what happens to everyone           else.            Yeah like her Mom.            The Dutch Tulip Man...                                      Sysiphus the Hamster...          Hazel beams. Gus totally gets the book. A bond between them.            Have you tried contacting this...           Peter Van Houten?            I've written letters. He's never           responded. Apparently he moved to           Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't           published anything. Doesn't do           interviews.            Sad.            Hang on.           (turns to Isaac)           Isaac!          Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaac's hand.            Pillows don't break.          Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES.            You need to break something.          Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission.          Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy          breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands          him another.            Go to town, my friend.          And Isaac does. Smashing them one by one. Hazel looks at Gus.            I've been looking for a way to tell           my Dad that I kinda hate           basketball. Think maybe we've found           it.          Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces.          Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left          Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.            Feel better?          Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm          around him but looks at Hazel.                                      That's the thing about pain... it           demands to be felt.          Hazel smiles. And on her face, we CUT TO:                                    Where Hazel is having dinner with her parents.            Dr. Maria called today. The PET           Scan is set for the eighth.          Hazel nods. This could be a source of worry but she's not          going to think about that right now. She's upbeat. And she's          actually eating, which her parents can't help but notice.          Frannie and Michael look at one another, pleased.            I told you Support Group was a good           idea.          Hazel's phone buzzes. ""Augustus."" She looks to her parents.            By all means.                                    Hazel lays on the grass in her backyard staring up at the          stars. She rings him back and as she does SPLITSCREEN w/          Hazel in the grass and:                                    Gus (upside down) in bed, a laptop on his chest.            Hazel Grace.            Hello Augustus.            So I read it again. And I just kept           feeling like... like it was a gift.           Like you'd given me something           important.             You're welcome.            On the other hand... we need           closure, don't we?                                      What we need is a sequel.            Yes. We need to know what happens           to Anna's family after she dies.            That's what I kept asking Van           Houten for in my letters.            But he never wrote back.            That's correct.            Because he's a recluse.            Yeee-up.            Utterly unreachable.            Unfortunately so.          Gus clears his throat, smiles. Hazel waits.            ""Dear Mr. Waters... I am writing to           thank you for your electronic           correspondence received this 6th of           April.          Hazel sits up. Could it be...?            ""I am grateful to anyone who sets           aside the time to read my book...""            Augustus!?            I found his assistant. I emailed           her. She must have forwarded it to           him.           (Hazel is stunned)           Shall I continue?            Keep reading, keep reading!                                      ""I am particularly indebted to you,           sir, both for your kind words about           `An Imperial Affliction' and for           taking the time to tell me that the           book, and here I quote you           directly, `meant a great deal' to           you.""          Hazel pays attention to every word.            ""To answer your question: No, I           have not written anything else, nor           will I. I do not feel that           continuing to share my thoughts           with readers would benefit either           them or me. However thank you again           for your generous email. Yours most           sincerely, Peter Van Houten.            You're making this up?            Hazel Grace, could I, with my           meager intellectual capabilities,           make up a letter from the great           Peter Van Houten?            Holy hell.            Indeed.            Can I... would you mind...             Go check your in-box.          Hazel jumps up as fast as her lungs will allow. CUT TO:                                    Hazel sits at her computer, Van Houten's assistant's email          address staring her in the face. The cursor blinks on a blank          page. And then Hazel starts writing...            ""Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten, my name           is Hazel Grace Lancaster. My friend           Augustus Waters, who read your book           - at my recommendation - just           received an email from you at this           address. I hope you will not mind           that he shared that email with me.""                                    While Hazel reads the letter, we see a SERIES OF SCENES          showing the next several days. They include:          - Hazel and Gus drinking coffees at a cafe. He's          enthusiastically telling a story and she's enjoying every          moment of it.          - Hazel helping Gus become a better driver. It's no use.            ""I was wondering if you wouldn't           mind answering a few questions I           have about what happens after the           end of the book. Specifically, the           - In his kitchen, laughing, trying to make omelettes.            ""Does Anna's Mom marry the Dutch           Tulip Man; is the Dutch Tulip Man           up to something - or is he just           misunderstood? What happens to           Anna's friends?          - Watching TV. Their bodies almost touching. But not quite.            Lastly, I was hoping you could shed           some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.           These questions have haunted me for           years. And I don't know how long I           have left to get answers to them.""          And finally, back in Hazel's bedroom. She finishes reading          this letter into the phone.            ""I know these are not important           literary questions and that your           book is full of important literary           questions, but I would just really           like to know.""          INTERCUT w/ Gus bouncing a ball against the wall, listening.            (reading it aloud to him)           ""And of course, if ever you do           decide to write anything else, even           if you don't want to publish it,           I'd love to read it. Frankly, I'd           read your grocery lists. Yours with           great admiration, Hazel Grace           Lancaster. Age 16.""            Not bad.                                      You think?            Bit pretentious. But then again,           Van Houten uses words like           ""tendentious"" and... ""bacchanalia""           so I think he'll like it.          Hazel smiles, looks at a clock.            Is it really almost 1?            Guess so.            I gotta get to sleep.            Ok...            Ok...          Neither one of them want to hang up the phone.            Ok...            Ok...          They both laugh at this.            Perhaps ""ok"" will be our ""always.""          Hazel smiles.            Ok.            Ok.            Ok.          Gus hangs up. We stay with Hazel. Is it really possible this          Beautiful Boy likes her? She thinks about it. She's not          convinced. CUT TO:                                    Isaac lies in bed, bandages covering his eyes, now officially          blind. A NURSE attends to him while Hazel sits by his side.                                      She hasn't even visited. Fourteen           months we were together. What kind           of person...            You'll get over her Isaac. Just           takes a little time. You'll see.          The Nurse exits the room.            Is she gone?            Yeah.            Did she really just say ""you'll           see?""            (shakes her head)           Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go.            Doesn't pun your disability.            Gets blood on the first try.            That is huge. I mean, seriously, is           this my freakin' arm or a           dartboard? Three - no condescending           voice.            (lays it on thick)           ""I'm gonna stab you with this           needle now, so there might be a           little ouchie.""          They laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment.            You doing alright, Isaac?            I don't know. To be honest, I think           a hell of a lot more about Monica           than my eye. Is that crazy? That's           crazy.            It's a little crazy.                                      But I believe in love, you know? I           don't believe that everybody gets           to keep their eyes or not get sick           or whatever, but everybody should           have true love. Don't you think?          Hazel thinks about it as Isaac presses the button on his pain          pump, self-administering morphine.            Gus was here earlier.            (trying to be nonchalant)           Was he?          Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in.            Mmm... that's better.            The pain?           (off his slow nod)           Good. Good, Isaac.           (Isaac closes his eyes)           What about Gus?          But Isaac is already asleep. Whatever he was going to say          about Gus is gone. Hazel nods, pats his hand. CUT TO:                                    Hazel rolls out of bed, stumbles to her computer. She          casually checks her in-box and is shocked to discover - he's          written her back!            Holy shit!            ""Dear Ms. Lancaster... I cannot           answer your questions, at least not           in writing, because to do so would           constitute a sequel, which you           might publish or otherwise share on           the internet. Not that I don't           trust you, but how could I trust           you, I barely know you.""          Hazel's jaw hangs open as she reads the next part:            ""Should ever you find yourself in           Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your           leisure. Yours most sincerely,           Peter Van Houten"" Son of a - WHAT                                     Frannie races in, clearly expecting a health problem.            What's wrong?!            (realizing she scared her)           Nothing. Sorry.             Nothing?            Everything! Look!          Hazel shows Frannie the note. Frannie reads it.            Can we go to Amsterdam? Please?          Frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat.            Hazel, I... I love you and... you           know I'd do anything for you, but           we don't...            We don't have the money. The           expense of getting equipment over           there - love, it's just not           possible...             No, yeah, of course.          Clearly Frannie feels awful. Which makes Hazel feel awful.            I mean, I could talk to your father             Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything.           Forget I mentioned it.          A beat between them. Frannie walks out, sadly. Hazel sits on          the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons.            Guilt is definitely a side effect           of cancer.                                    Hazel and Gus walk together on the sidewalk.                                      Just use your wish.            I've used it already. Pre-           ""Miracle.""            What'd you do?          Hazel doesn't want to say. Gus realizes.            Not Disney.            I was 13...            Tell me you did not go to Disney           World.           (Hazel looks away)           Hazel Grace! You did not use your           one dying Wish to go to Disney           World!             And Epcot Center.            (hands in the air)           Oh my God!             We had fun on that trip.            That is the saddest thing I've ever           heard!            I met Goofy...            Now I'm embarrassed.            Why are you embarrassed?            How can I have a crush on a girl           with such cliche wishes?            Wait, what?          The word ""crush"" has taken Hazel totally by surprise.                                      What?          She looks at him. A beat. She quickly looks away, blushing.          Gus continues on about Disney but all Hazel can think about          is ""CRUSH"". She tries not to seem too excited. CUT TO:                                    Hazel, in a hospital gown, is slowly fed through the machine.          A TECH explains that she should hold still, try and relax,          etc. But Hazel knows. She knows all about these procedures.          She's a pro. CUT TO:                                    Gus is waiting on the front stoop when Frannie's car pulls          up. They're home from the hospital.          He wears an Indiana Pacers JERSEY and carries a bouquet of          bright orange TULIPS.          Michael gets out of the passenger's seat to help Hazel out of          the car. Gus rises to assist them.            Is that a Rik Smits jersey?            It is indeed.             Man, I loved that guy.          Hazel sees Gus, wasn't expecting him.            Gus?            Hi Hazel.            How would you like to go on a           picnic?                                    Gus is with Frannie and Michael downstairs.            Something to drink?            I'm great Mrs. Lancaster.                                    Meanwhile, upstairs, Hazel gets ready for the date. She's put          the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on          LIP GLOSS. She can faintly hear the conversation downstairs.          ANGLE ON Gus sitting on the stairs. Michael next to him.            You're a survivor yourself?            (taps his leg)           Didn't cut this fella off for the           hell of it. Though it is an           excellent weight-loss strategy.           Legs are heavy!            How's your health now?            N-E-C for fourteen months.            That's fantastic.            I'm very lucky.          ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to          like what she sees a lot more than before.          BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs:            Son, you have to understand...           Hazel's still pretty sick. She will           be the rest of her life.          ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this. She stops what          she's doing and listens.            She'll want to keep up with you -           she's that kind of girl - but the           truth is, her lungs --            You ready Gus?          Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence. CUT TO:                                    Behind the Indianapolis Museum of Art is 152 Acres of Gardens          and Grounds. Hazel and Gus walk together.            Is this where you bring all your           romantic conquests?                                      Every last one.            Probably why I'm still a virgin.          Hazel laughs, elbows him.            You're not a virgin.           (off his look)           Are you really?          Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it.            See this? This circle is virgins...          Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle.            And this... is 17 year old dudes           with one leg.          Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk          up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the          ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a          set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play.             ""Funky Bones"" by Joep Van Lieshout.            He sounds Dutch.            And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And           tulips.          Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus. He's sure taking this          Amsterdam/Dutch thing pretty far. He removes some sandwiches          and orange juice out of a basket.            Sandwich?            Let me guess --             Dutch cheese. And tomato.           (she takes one)           The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry.          They eat for a second, their eyes watching the children play          on the bones.                                      How cool is that? A skeleton being           used as a playground.            You do love your symbols.            Speaking of which...          Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. He          clears his throat.            You're probably wondering why           you're sitting here eating a bad           cheese sandwich and drinking orange           juice with a guy in a Rik Smits           jersey.            It has crossed my mind.            Hazel Grace, like so many before           you - and I say this with great           affection - you spent your Wish...           moronically.            I was thir--            Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand           soliloquy here.            Sorry. Please, continue...            You were young. Impressionable. The           Grim Reaper staring you in the           face. And the fear of dying with           your one true Wish left ungranted           led you to rush into making one you           didn't really want, for how could           little Hazel Grace, having never           read ""An Imperial Affliction"" ever           know that her one TRUE wish was to           visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his           Amsterdamian exile.          Hazel nods in agreement.            If you were smart, you would have           saved your wish til the time in           your life when you really knew your           true self.                                    Gus stops talking. Hazel is confused.            But I... didn't save it.          Gus smiles.            Good thing I saved mine.          Hazel cocks her head to one side. What is he talking about?            Got it in exchange for the leg.            And I still have it.          She starts to realize.            Are you saying --            I'm not gonna give you my Wish or           anything. But I too have an           interest in meeting Peter Van           Houten and it wouldn't make much           sense to meet him without the girl           who introduced me to his book, now           would it?           (Hazel's eyes widen)           I talked to the Genies and they're           in total agreement.            We leave on May third.          Hazel is so excited that she grabs Gus and pulls him into a          hug. Their faces close, lips inches apart, and just when it          looks like something might happen --            Wait a minute.            Are you only doing this so I'll           kiss you?          A beat. Gus blinks a few times.            Cause I'd totally kiss you either           way.          And kiss him she does. He's surprised. And when it's over,          they sit back, look at one another. A magic moment.            Seriously... why are you doing           this?                                      Because Hazel Grace... I found my           Wish.          And Hazel is beyond touched. We hear:            Are you out of your mind?                                    Frannie folds laundry while Hazel pleads her case.            It's too much, Haze. We can't           accept something like that from a           virtual stranger.            He's not a stranger.            Really?            Don't be gross.            It's still ""no,"" I'm afraid.            Can we at least ask Dr. Maria?                                    Where Hazel's oncologist DR. MARIA shakes her head.            That's out of the question.            You said the PET scan was           encouraging!            The PET scan is encouraging. We           just don't know how long it'll stay           that way. What if you get sick in a           foreign country?            They have doctors in Amsterdam. And           cancer. Someone will know what to           do.                                      Be that as it may, without someone           familiar with your particular case,           I can't --            (turns to her Mom)           So you'll come too.            What?            The Genies can hook it up. They're           loaded.              You've never been to Amsterdam,           have you Mom?          And judging from her face, seems she'd kinda like to. Dr.          Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs - kid's got a point.          Hazel smiles. And on that smile, we SMASH CUT TO:           Over which, we HEAR:            And then this happened.                                    [Note: There's no sound in this sequence. Just images.]          Hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, shaking          and holding her head.          Frannie and Michael burst in. Mom grabs her crying daughter,          frightened beyond belief, waves to Michael to call for help.            People talk about the courage of           cancer patients. And I do not deny           that courage...          He leaves the room to do so and Fran stays behind, rocking          with her daughter, promising her it'll all be ok. Whatever          nightmare this is, it's going to end. CUT TO:                                    Still silent. Michael drives, trying to keep it together.          Frannie's in the back with Hazel's head in her lap.                                    Hazel continues to scream in silence, whether from pain or          terror, we do not know.            I'd been poked and stabbed and           poisoned for years and still I trod           on.                                    Michael carries Hazel into the chaotic emergency room.          They're practically running. There's still no sound.            But make no mistake...          The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child.          She's wheeled away from her family who can only watch. We          stay with her and WE HEAR:            In that moment I would have been           very, very happy to die.                                     The sound returns. And it's the sound of a heart monitor.          BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It's also the sound of a working heart.          Hazel has made it through. Her eyes open. A NURSE is there.            Hello.            Hi.            You're ok, Hazel.          Even Hazel seems surprised by that.            Would you like to see your parents?          Hazel nods. The Nurse goes to get them. Soon they come          bounding in, crying and kissing her repeatedly. So much          relief. CUT TO:          LATER. Hazel's bed has been raised up so she can talk to her          parents ""comfortably.""            They thought it was a brain tumor.            It wasn't - thank god --                                      So what happened?            The usual. Fluid in the lungs,           preventing oxygenation. They put           that in...          There's a TUBE in Hazel's side draining fluid into a plastic          bladder that hangs off her bed.            Drained a liter and a half last           night.          (That's a lot of fluid.)            The good news is... no tumor           growth. No new tumors in your body.          Hazel nods. That is a relief.            We're all so relieved.          Frannie embraces her daughter.            This is just a thing Hazel. It's a           thing we can live with.          Hazel nods again. Only in the universe of Hazel Grace          Lancaster is something like this just a thing. Meanwhile:                                    Here's Gus, his foot tapping nervously on the floor. It's          unclear how long he's been waiting there. He sees Michael          walk down the hall. Races after him.            Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing?            Better, thank you. Much better.          Gus nods, as relieved as the rest of them.            They won't let me in. Family only.            I'm sorry --            No I get it. Will you just... will           you tell her I was here?                                      Of course I will.          Gus smiles. And sits back down. Though he won't get to see          her, he still wants to stay.            Gus.          Michael really likes this kid.            Why don't you go home, get some           rest?          Gus looks up. That might be for the best. CUT TO:                                    Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table          along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole          ""Cancer Team.""            The great news is... Phalanxifor           continues to control your tumor           growth.            The not so great news is we're           still seeing serious problems with           fluid accumulation.            So how should we proceed?          Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to          answer. No one does.            Um, I feel like I'm not the most           qualified person to answer that.            I was talking to Dr. Simmons.          DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next.            It's a strange case. Normally the           tumors start resisting the           treatment. But that hasn't happened           here - yet.          Hazel hears the ""yet"" the loudest.            Unfortunately, the drug may be           worsening the edema.                                      But if we stopped it entirely,           we're likely to face even graver           dangers.            So we're gonna do nothing?            That's what we have to decide. The           truth is... very few people have           been on Phalanxifor as long as           Hazel has. We don't really know the           long term effects.          That comforts no one.            Can't I just get like a lung           transplant or something?          The Doctors look at one another like ""who wants to take that          one?"" Eventually:            You would not be considered a...           strong candidate for a transplant.          Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother          her. Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a          little bit. He grabs Frannie's hand.            We're trying to prevent endothelial           growth while at the same time           preventing immunosorbent...          As Dr. Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook,          Hazel's eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents. She hates          what she's doing to them. And seeing them holding hands,          crying but trying not to cry - it jogs a memory. CUT TO:                                    We saw this once before. It looks like the end for 13-year          old Hazel. Her father is weeping off to the side while her          mom stands over her, holding her hand, and asking:            (through the tears)           Are you ready, sweetie?          13-year old Hazel nods. The doctors get to work. The          anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under. But not enough.          Cause she totally hears her mother say:            I won't be a mom anymore.                                    She falls into her husband's chest. And we're BACK TO:                                    Hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her          staring at them. She tries to shake it off. Dr. Simmons is          still talking nonsense when:            I have a question.            Yes Hazel.            Can I still go to Amsterdam?          Dr. Simmons can't help himself. He laughs. Everyone looks at          him. He clears his throat.            That would not be wise at this           juncture.            Why not?            Excuse me?            Why not, Dr. Simmons?            The doctors are trying to be delicate here.            It would... increase some risks --            So does going to the mall --            Yes but an airplane?            They have oxygen on airplanes.              It's my life, right?            You're Stage IV --                                      I have this opportunity I may never           have again. If the medicine's           working, I don't see why --            Because, Hazel.            Look, I don't know any other way to           say this... You're just too sick.          And this is like a punch in the gut.            I'm sorry.          Everyone feels horrible now. Dr. Maria, Frannie and Michael,          and even Hazel. This meeting couldn't have gone worse. And we                                     Hazel parent's bring her home from the hospital. She looks          miserable. It's clear the last few days have been a big          emotional set back. CUT TO:                                    Her parents tuck her in.            We'll be right outside.          Hazel nods. Her phone buzzes. She looks at it. A text from          Gus that reads: ""ok?"" Hazel looks at it.          And she doesn't write back. CUT TO:                                    Hazel sits staring at nothing. The house phone rings. Michael          comes in from another room with the phone in hand. Whispers:            Gus again.          Hazel thinks about it - silently shakes her head, no. Michael          says into the phone.            I'm sorry Gus, she's asleep.          Hazel stands and goes into her bedroom, clearly depressed.                                     Hazel reads from ""An Imperial Affliction."" Her phone buzzes          again. ""Augustus."" It just says ""hello?"" Again she ignores          it.          And then a second text. She looks at it. ""The silence is          deafening."" She puts the phone back down.          Hazel's heart breaks. She can't take it anymore. She picks          the phone back up. She texts the following:          ""I don't know if you'll understand this but I can't see you          anymore. I mean I want to. I just...""          She thinks about the rest. She writes:          ""I'm a grenade.""          She sends the text. Waits.          And then there's more to say. She sends a second text.          ""When I look at you, all I can see is what I'm going to put          you through. I can't have that. I'm sorry.""          She sends that text. Waits.          He writes back.          ""Ok.""          Hazel reads it. Writes back: ""Ok.""          A beat. Gus responds: ""oh my god, stop flirting with me!""          Hazel smiles - she can't help herself! - but she must. She          gets her emotions in check. Puts the phone away. CUT TO:                                    An ugly day in Indianapolis.                                    Inside, Hazel is about as miserable as the weather. The sky -          and the circumstances - have cast a grey pall over the day.                                    Hazel walks out back. Looks up at the clouds, threatening          rain but not yet delivering it. She sits down in the grass,          on the verge of tears. She looks at the old rusty SWING SET          that's been in her backyard for years.                                    And starts to cry. Just for a few brief moments, she lets          herself cry.          Then she wipes the tears. Becomes strong again. And makes a          decision.          Hazel dials her phone. We hear:            Hazel Grace!            Hi Augustus.            Are you crying, Hazel Grace?            Kind of.            What's the matter?            I don't know. I want to go to           Amsterdam. And I want him to tell           us what happens after the book and           I don't want my particular life and           also the sky is making me sad and           there's this old swing set that my           Dad made for me when I was a kid.           It's just... everything.          Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of          silence pass by.            I demand to see this swing set of           tears.          Hazel can't help but smile and we CUT TO:          LATER. Same backyard - only now Hazel is with Gus. Which          makes everything better.          They both look at the swing set.            I see your point.            That is one sad swing set.          Hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder.            Thanks for coming over.                                      You do realize... trying to keep           your distance from me will in no           way lessen my affection for you.          Hazel says nothing.            All efforts to save me from you           will fail.          Hazel looks at him. He's sure not making this easy.            Is this about Amsterdam? Cause we             It's not about Amsterdam. It's           about me. It's about...            Grenades.          Hazel nods.            I get it. One day you're going to           explode in a huge ball of fire and           everyone close to you will die in           your wake.            Exactly.            There's already two people in your           life you're going to destroy. Why           add a third to that list. Am I           right?             That's why I don't have a hamster.          Gus is silent. He can't argue. They stand there quietly a few          more beats, looking out at the swing set. Until:            We have got to do something about           this frigging swing set.                                    Hazel sits at the computer screen writing a Craigslist post.          Gus stands next to her.                                       ""Swing Set Needs Home.""            ""Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs           Loving Home.""            ""Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing           Set Seeks Butts of Children.""          Gus laughs.            No?          Gus laughs harder. Hazel laughs with him.            That's why.          Hazel looks at him, not understanding.            In case you were wondering...           that's why I like you.           (beat, off her look)           You're so busy being you that you           have no idea how utterly           unprecedented you are.          Hazel absorbs that. Her feelings for this boy in a tangle.                                     Gus and Hazel watch as a TOWNIE finishes loading the swing          set into the back of his PICK-UP. Gus salutes the swing set          as the truck drives off.          Then he sneaks a quick kiss on Hazel's cheek. She shoots him          a look. Gus throws up his hands.            Friendly.          She playfully elbows him away.                                    Hazel walks with Isaac out of Support Group.            Do you like him?            Of course I like him.                                      But you don't want to hook up with           him?          Hazel doesn't know what she wants.            It's complicated.                                    Hazel is at her computer reading a new email from Lidewij          Vliegenthart. Clearly Hazel was not expecting this.            ""Dear Hazel, I have received word           via the Genies that you will be           visiting us with Augustus Waters           and your mother beginning on the           4th. A week away! Peter and I are           delighted and cannot wait to --          Hazel is confused. She stands and walks into the hallway.            Mom?          No response.            Mom!            Frannie races out of her room in a towel, dripping wet.            What is it, what's wrong?!            Sorry, I... I didn't know you were           in the shower.             Bath. I was just... just trying to           take a bath for five seconds.           What's the matter?            Did you ever call the Genies to           tell them the trip is off? I just           got an email from Peter Van           Houton's assistant. She still           thinks we're coming.          Frannie purses her lips and squints past Hazel. Clearly          unsure what to say.                                      What?          Frannie can't keep a straight face.            I'm not supposed to tell you until           your father gets home.            We're going to Amsterdam.            (still not believing)           Really...            Dr. Maria called last night and           made a convincing case that you           need to live --             Hazel can't move all that fast to hug her Mom so Frannie          comes to her and they embrace. After:            I'm getting back in the tub now.          When she leaves Hazel grabs her cell phone. ANGLE ON IT.          Hazel sends Gus the following text: ""STILL FREE MAY 3? :-)""          A moment later Gus responds: ""EVERYTHING'S COMING UP WATERS!""          Hazel is over the moon with excitement. She smiles, then          tries to calm herself, knowing it's the best thing.            (whispering to her lungs)           One week, lungs. Keep your shit           together one more week...                                    Luggage waits by the door, including oxygen tanks and medical          equipment. Frannie makes breakfast as Hazel enters, now          dressed and excited for the trip.            Amsterdam!            Amsterdam!          And a moment later Michael joins them.                                      Amsterdam!          They're all going crazy with excitement! CUT TO:                                    Michael finishes loading up the car. Kisses his wife goodbye.          He embraces Hazel. She hugs him back and of course he starts          to cry.             I love you. I'm so proud of you.            For what?          Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears. They look at          each other. Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another          hug. Hazel lets him, laughing.                                    The car is packed with oxygen tanks, a suitcase for clothes,          another for medicines and back-up medicines just in case etc.          Frannie pulls up to Gus's house. They get out of the car and          head to the front door, buzzing with excitement.          As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A          WOMAN'S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by:             Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly          spins her back to the car.            Mom?            We can't eavesdrop, Hazel.          Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure          what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn.          A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel          bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips.             Always a pleasure to see you ma'am.            Hello, Hazel Grace.                                      Ok...?            Ok.            Ok.          Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just          says, when they stop and look at her:            Amsterdam!                                    A SKYCAP helps Hazel, Gus and Frannie with all their bags and          equipment.                                    They wait in line for the security checkpoint. When it's          Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose.          Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt.          Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector.          She seems determined to get through this without any help.          But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these          few steps without oxygen were a struggle.          Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady          herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula          back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and          focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her,          nervously.            (with some difficulty)           Amsterdam!                                    Arriving at the Gate area they draw curious looks from the          OTHER PASSENGERS: Hazel with her oxygen tank, Gus with his          noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment.          A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit.            Oh that's not necessary.          But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them.          We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the          attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears.                                      What's in your nose?            It's called a Cannula. These tubes           give me oxygen and help me breathe.          The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic.            Jackie... Oh, I'm sorry.             No, no. It's alright.            Would they help me breathe too?            I dunno. Wanna try?          Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it.            Tickles.            Right?            I think I'm breathing better.            Well... I'd love to give you my           cannula but... I kinda really need           the help.          The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly          reattaches it.            Thanks for letting me try it.          They smile at each other before the Little Girl walks back to          her family. She waves. Hazel waves back.            We will now begin pre-boarding           Flight 144 to Amsterdam. For those           passengers in need of extra           assistance...            I think that's us.                                     Hazel sits in the middle with Frannie on the aisle and Gus at          the window. He looks around, antsy.            Have you never been on a plane           before?          Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he's nervous. He pulls a          cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within          seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over.            Sir, you can't smoke on this plane.           Or... any plane.            (cigarette in his mouth)           I don't smoke.          The Flight Attendant shoots him a look.            It's a metaphor. He puts the           killing thing in his mouth but           doesn't give it the power to kill           him.             That metaphor is prohibited on           today's flight.          Gus nods and puts the cigarette away.            ""Flight attendants, prepare for           departure.""          The engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards          take off. Gus is getting more worried by the second. He grabs          the arm rest, his eyes wide.            Ok?          Gus doesn't say it back. Hazel laughs.            This is what it feels like to ride           in a car with you.          Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out          the window - they're flying! - and then back to Hazel.            We're flying! Look!          Hazel smiles at his enthusiasm.                                      Holy -- look at that?! NOTHING HAS            He's adorable at this moment. Hazel can't resist leaning over          to give him a kiss on the cheek.            (not looking up from her            Just so you know, I'm right here.           Sitting next to you. Your mother.            We're just friends, Mom.            She is. I'm not.          Hazel shoots him a look. Gus shrugs - ""what, it's the truth.""          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:          LATER. Mid-flight, the plane is dark, Frannie's asleep. Hazel          and Gus watch the same gory action movie. Actually, he          watches the movie. She just watches him watch it. He watches          it with gusto.          Hazel continues to watch him. Try as she might, she's falling          in love. CUT TO:          SFX: the PLANE touching down. CUT TO:                                    Hazel, Gus, and Frannie ride in the back of a YELLOW CAB.            Americans?            We're from Indiana.            Indiana. They steal from the           Indians but the keep the name, yes?          Hazel and Gus share a look.            Something like that.          Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt          tracks and the occasional concrete building. In other words,          it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland.            (to the Driver)           This is Amsterdam?                                      Yes and no. Amsterdam is like the           rings of a tree. It gets older as           you get closer to the center.          Soon enough, the cab takes an off-ramp and turns a corner and          suddenly, it's as if they're transported - not only to          another universe but to another time as well.          We see MULTI-COLORED ROW HOUSES lined on both sides of a          windy CANAL. HOUSEBOATS float against the edges and everyone          rides BICYCLES down cobblestone streets. They're astounded.                                    Gus helps Hazel and Frannie bring their stuff into the room.          We see a WICKER BASKET of gifts - presents from the Genies -          welcoming their arrival. Hazel, exhausted, sits on the bed.            I'll be right down the hall.          Hazel nods, already drifting off to sleep. CUT TO:                                    Some time later. Hazel stirs. Her Mom is seated in a sagging,          paisley CHAIR across from the bed reading a TRAVEL GUIDE.            Good morning.            Actually, it's five o'clock.            How was the park?            Never made it.            Mom!            What? I like watching you sleep.          Hazel shoots Frannie a look. Even in an exotic city, her Mom          still can't enjoy herself.            I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff           tonight while you and Gus are at           dinner.            What do you mean?                                      You have reservations at a place           called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set           it up. Very fancy according to the           Book. And romantic.            Mom...            I'm just saying...            A 16 year old girl running free           with an older boy on the streets of           a foreign city famous for its vice           and debauchery... is totally cool           with you. Is that what you're           saying?            (beat, excited)           Let's get you dressed!          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:                                    Frannie opens the door to find Gus in a perfectly tailored          BLACK SUIT, cigarette dangling from his mouth.            (calling to the bathroom)           Hazel! Gus is here.            Looking sharp.            Thank you ma'am.          A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears          a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks...            Wow.              Am I under-dressed?            You look gorgeous.          Gus offers Hazel his arm. She takes it. They're ready to go.                                     Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city. ELM          TREES line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the          wind like a spring snowstorm.          An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens          all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls          on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto          the city. Excited. The night just beginning.                                    At the edge of the canal, near an ancient bridge. Hazel and          Gus are shown to a TABLE right next to the water.            Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters.          Gus pulls out Hazel's chair for her. A WAITER brings them a          bottle of CHAMPAGNE as they sit.            The champagne is our gift.          Hazel and Gus look at each other. Is this a dream? The          champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass.            Ok.          Hazel raises hers.            Ok.          They clink glasses and sip.            Wow that's good.            Do you know what Dom Perignon said           after he invented champagne?            `Come quickly,' he said. `I am           tasting the stars!'          Hazel and Gus smile.            Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like           a menu or will you have the chef's           choice?          Gus looks at Hazel. She shrugs.                                      The chef's choice sounds lovely.           (the Waiter nods)           And can we get more of this?            We have bottled all the stars for           you this evening, my young friends.          The Waiter leaves. Hazel and Gus look at each other.            Thank you for coming to Amsterdam.            Thank you for letting me hijack           your wish.            Thank you for wearing that dress           which is like whoa.          Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to.          The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:            Belgian white asparagus with a           lavender infusion.          Hazel takes a bite.            Oh my god.            Yeah?          Gus takes a bite.            I mean...            That is just...            There are no words.          Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with          merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them          and says something in Dutch.             We don't speak Dutch!            She says, ""the beautiful couple is           beautiful!""                                    Hazel and Gus smile. This night could not be going any better          so far. CUT TO:          LATER. Hazel and Gus enjoying their second courses.            I want this dragon carrot risotto           to become a person so I can take it           to Vegas and marry it.          Hazel leans back in her chair, in need of a breather.            I like your suit.            Thanks. First time wearing it.            That isn't the suit you wear to           funerals?            Oh no. That one's not nearly this           nice.           (off her look)           When I first found out I was sick -           I mean, they told me I had like an           85% chance to be cancer-free. Great           odds, sure. But that meant a year           of torture, the loss of my leg, and           still a 15% chance it might fail.            So right before the surgery I asked           my parents if I could buy a suit,           like a really nice suit, just in           case I didn't make it.            It's your death suit.            That's what it is.            I have one of those. Bought it for           my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd           wear it on a date, though.            Are we on a date?            (cocks her head)           Watch it.          Gus winks. CUT TO:          LATER. Dessert on the table. As they euphorically eat:                                      God?            Maybe.            Angels?            Undecided.            Afterlife?            No. Well...            Maybe I wouldn't go so far as to           say no. I just... I'd like some           evidence.            What do you think?            Absolutely.            Really?            Oh for sure. I mean, not like a           heaven where you ride unicorns,           play harps, and live in a mansion           made of clouds but, yeah, I believe           in something.          Hazel is surprised.            Something becomes of us. It has to.           Otherwise what's the point?            Maybe there is no point.            I refuse to accept that.            I won't accept it.          Hazel thinks about it. She appreciates his conviction but is          still not sure she agrees. The hand they've been dealt too          unfair. Hazel looks out at the water as she says:            I hope you're right.            I'm in love with you.                                    That gets her attention.            You heard me.              I'm in love with you. And I know           that love is just a shout into the           void, and that oblivion is           inevitable, and that we're all           doomed and that there will come a           day when all our labor has been           returned to dust, and I know the           sun will swallow the only earth           we'll ever have, and I am in love           with you.           (shrugs, matter-of-fact)           Sorry.          At which point, the Waiter reappears.            More stars?          Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on          Gus. Eventually Gus answers for them.            Just the check, please.            No, sir.            Your meal has been paid for by Mr.           Van Houten.          Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel. This Van Houten guy is          something else.                                    Hazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking          out over the water. Seeds blow from the elm trees and the          reflections of the city ripple in the water below them.          Hazel leans into his body, just a little. They stay like          that, savoring the best night of both of their lives. CUT TO:                                    A crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam. The buzz in the air          outside is equalled by the buzz in:                                     Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room.            I really don't get that shirt.          Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's ""Ceci N'est          Pas Une Pipe."" (A painting of a pipe with words below that          mean ""This is not a pipe."")            Van Houten will get it. Trust me.           There are like fifty Magritte           references in ""Imperial           Affliction.""             ""This is not a pipe.""            Exactly.            But it is a pipe.            No it's not. It's a drawing of a           pipe. See?            All representations of a thing are           inherently abstract. A drawing of a           thing is not the thing itself. Nor           is a t-shirt of a drawing of a           thing the thing itself.          Frannie is still at a loss but she's impressed.            When did you get so grown up? I           feel like it was yesterday I was           telling 8-year old Hazel why the           sky was blue. You thought I was a           genius back then.            Why is the sky blue?             Because I say so.          A knock on the door. Gus pokes his head in.            Who's ready for some answers!                                     Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house.            I'm so excited I can barely           breathe.            As opposed to other days...?          She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen          tank, and up they go towards his front door.          As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from          inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.          Like, obnoxiously loud.          Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's          no response.            Maybe he can't hear over the music?          Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He          tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait.          Still excited.          A moment later the door swings open.          It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning          hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:            What?!          Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be?            Mr. Van Houten?          At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces.          Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed          door, they hear this:               Are they here, Peter?          So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can't believe it.            There are two --            Who the hell's ""they?""                                      They are Augustus and Hazel, the           young fans with whom you've been           corresponding.          Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will          help things take a turn for the better.            The Americans?            You invited them, remember?            You know why I left America,           Lidewij? To never have to encounter           Americans. Get rid of them.          Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible!            I will not do this Peter. Be nice.          At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose          voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ          (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves          Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.          And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,          two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:            Which of you is Augustus Waters?          Gus raises his hand tentatively.          Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and          walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.            Please. I am sorry. Come in.          Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes          a step. Hazel follows. They walk:                                    Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile          it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single          couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it.          Van Houten sits in the chair.          Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and          twist-tied.            Trash?                                      Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never           opens it.          Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his          slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch.            Yours are the first missives to           which I've replied and look where           that got me.          Hazel and Gus take their seats.            Scotch?            Um, no thanks.            Augustus Waters?            It's 11am.            Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and           soda.            Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?            She thinks I have a drinking           problem.            I also think the Earth is round.          Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it          to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.            So you like my book.            Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made           meeting you his Wish so that we           could come here and talk to you.          Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.            Did you dress like her on purpose?            (looks at her shirt)           Kinda.                                    Van Houten says nothing to that.            I do not have a drinking problem. I           have a Churchillian relationship           with alcohol: I can crack jokes and           govern England and do anything I           want to do. Except not drink.          He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.            Incidentally, thank you for dinner           last night.             We bought them dinner last night?            It was our pleasure.             You've come a long way so... what           is it I can do for you?            We have some questions --            Uh-huh...            About what happens, you know...           after... the end of your book.           Specifically to those who Anna           leaves behind. Like her Mom, the           Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --             How familiar are you with Swedish           hip-hop?          Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding?            I would say... limited?            But presumably you know Afasi Och           Filthy's seminal album ""Flacken.""            Um...            Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla'           immediately.                                    Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds          later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers.          Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.            (yelling over the music)           I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak           Swedish.             Who the hell speaks Swedish? The           important thing is not what           nonsense the voices are saying, but           what the voices are feeling.          The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before          Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.            Are you messing with us?            Pardon?            Is this some kind of performance?            Rudolf Otto said that if you had           not encountered the numinous then           his work was not for you. And I say           to you, my friends, if you cannot           hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic           response to fearfulness, then my           work is not for you.          Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all          this way for this?            So anyway... when the book ends,           Anna's mom --            (raising a hand to silence            Let us imagine that you are racing           a tortoise.          Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly          feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues.            The tortoise has a ten yard head           start. In the time it takes you to           run ten yards, the tortoise has           moved maybe one yard. And so on,           forever.              You are faster than the tortoise           but you can never catch him, you           see, you can only decrease his           lead. Now certainly you can run           past the tortoise as long as you           don't contemplate the mechanics           involved but the question of how           turns out to be so complicated that           no one really solved it until           Cantor's proof that some infinities           are bigger than other infinities.          Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond.            I assume that answers your           questions.             I don't know what's going on.            And yet you seemed so intelligent           in print, Mr. Waters.           (under his breath)           Must be all that cancer in your           brain.            Peter!          Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the          situation.            Can we please, maybe, talk about           Anna for a sec? I mean, I           understand that the story ends mid-           sentence because she dies or she           becomes too sick to continue --            I'm not interested in talking about           that book.            - but that doesn't mean her family           and everyone she loves doesn't have           a future, right?            I said I'm not interested --             But you promised!               Mr. Van Houten, you said you would           tell us what happens and that's why           we're here. We... I need you tell           me. Surely you've thought about it.           I mean, as characters --            Nothing happens to them! They're           fictions. They cease to exist the           moment the novel is over.          This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear. She won't          accept it.            They can't!           (again, has to calm            I mean, I understand. In a literary           sense. But it's impossible NOT to           imagine some future --            I can't do this. Lidewij, get rid           of them, please.           (Lidewij doesn't move, he           turns back to Hazel)           I won't indulge your childish           whims. I refuse to pity you in the           manner in which you're accustomed.            I don't want your pity --            Of course you do. Like all sick           kids, your existence depends on it.            Peter!            (on a roll)           You are fated to live out your days           as the child you were when           diagnosed, the child who believes           there is life after a novel ends.           And we, as adults, we pity this, so           we pay for your treatments, for           your oxygen machines. We give you           food and water though you are           unlikely to live long enough --              You are a side effect of an           evolutionary process that cares           little for individual lives.              You are a failed experiment in           mutation.            Lidewij has tears in her eyes. Gus has balled his fists. But          not Hazel. Van Houten's words have not phased her one bit.          She rises from the couch.            Hey listen douchepants. You're not           gonna tell me anything I don't           already know about illness. I need           one thing and one thing only from           you before I walk out of your life           and that's for you to tell me what           happens to your goddman characters!             I cannot tell you.            Bullshit!            I cannot --          Van Houten goes to take a drink but...            Make something up.          ... Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands,          surprising everyone.          After a beat:            Lidewij. I'll have a martini           please.            I have resigned.            Oh don't be ridiculous.          No one moves. Van Houten realizes he's alone in this.            I'd like you to leave now.            You're really not gonna tell us?            I would like you... to leave.                                    Hazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is          if to say ""come on, enough of this guy."" CUT TO:                                    Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As          they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.            Have you ever stopped to ask why           you care so much about your silly           questions?          A beat.            Go fuck yourself.          Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the          door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.            Hey. It's ok. It's ok...           (beat, an idea)           I'll write you a sequel.           (she cries harder)           I will. Better than any shit that           drunk could write. With blood and           guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.          Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus          gives her a hug. Afterwards:            I spent your Wish on that asshole.            You did not spend it on him. You           spent it on us.          They embrace once more.            I wanted...            I know... I know. Apparently the           world is not a wish-granting           factory.          This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes          outside. Clearly she's been crying too.            I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made           him cruel. I thought meeting you           would help him, if he would see           that his work has shaped real           lives, but... I'm very sorry.                                    Hazel says nothing. Gus holds her in a very protective way.            Perhaps we can do some sightseeing.           Have you seen the Anne Frank House?            I'm not going anywhere with that           monster.            He is not invited.                                    Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news.            I'm afraid there's no elevator.            Oh, um, that's alright.            No, there are many stairs. Steep           stairs.            I can do it.              I can do it!          Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments          today. They are going inside. CUT TO:                                    A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of          Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of          BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of          them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.            Shall we?          Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So          far so good. They find themselves in an office space.            This is the bookcase that hid the           Frank family and four others.          The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set          of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.                                    Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks          at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the          climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen          tank.          Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored          breathing the entire time.          ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.          Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.          Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's          definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall          to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.            You're a champion.          Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the          next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more          narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this          he looks at Hazel:            That's enough --             I'm ok.          Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her          every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.          Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull          herself through.          Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the          wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.            We're at the top. That's it.          Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.          She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.          And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.          This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding          for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing          their story.            The only member of the whole family           to survive was Otto, Anne's father.          Gus takes Hazel's hand.            I don't know how you go on, without           your family.                                    Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads          Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO          details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear          a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.          The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the          same. The room is dark.            ""At such moment's, I don't think           about the misery...""          Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the          cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.            ""...but about the beauty that still           remains.""          Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she          watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.          Their eyes meet. The emotions build...            ""Try to recapture the happiness           within yourself. Think of all the           beauty in everything around you...           and be happy.""          And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-          against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've          experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a          small eternity.          Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly          notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,          they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...          When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the          whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts ""bravo!"" Hazel blushes,          Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:                                    They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the          moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:            It's above my knee.          She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.            It tapers a little and then it's           just skin --            What?                                    Hazel pulls away from him.            My leg.            Just so you're prepared --            Oh get over yourself.          Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off          but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure          it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They          shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical          Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:            I love you, Augustus Waters.            I love you too, Hazel Grace.          They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:                                    Gus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she          isn't there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.          It reads: ""Dearest Augustus...""          Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled ""Virgins."" And in that          circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled ""17 year old dudes          with one leg."" We'll notice part of that circle is now          outside the bigger circle. Gus flashes that signature smile.                                    Hazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at          an outdoor cafe. They're re-enacting yesterday's events.            ""Get up you fat bastard.""            ""I can't stand up, I'm too drunk.""            I said ""get up.""            ""Standing is for fools!""            God, what an asshole.          They both giggle at the whole thing.                                      It was awful, Mom. You can't           imagine.            And then what happened?            Then we went to the Anne Frank           museum.            And after that?          A quick glance between Hazel and Gus.            We just... walked around.          Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it          in check in front of her Mother.            Sounds lovely.          A few beats later.            Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs           a little. Give the two of you some           time to talk.             Um... ok...          As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and          Frannie making eye contact for a brief second. Once Frannie          has left them:            That was weird.          Gus doesn't respond except to say:            Shall we?                                    They start to walk. Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack,          sticks it between his lips. Hazel notices he's struggling          with something.            Augustus?                                      There's something I have to tell           you...          They walk in silence a few beats.            Just before you went into the           hospital... There was this... I           felt this... ache in my hip.          Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.            Oh no...          Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth          tightly, trying not to cry.            I had a PET scan.          Gus sits down on a BENCH. Looks up at her. Tries to smile.          Before he even says it, she knows.            It lit up like a Christmas tree,           Hazel...            Oh god.            The lining of my chest, my liver...           everywhere.            Oh my god no!          Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging          him for dear life, her head in his lap.            I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so             I'm sorry too --            It's so unfair --            I should have told you --            It's so fucking unfair!          A beat. Gus still trying not to cry.                                      Apparently the world is... not a           wish-granting factory.          And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be          sad and feel awful.          But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's          face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears.            Don't you worry about me, Hazel           Grace. I'll find a way to hang           around and annoy you for a long           time.          She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces.            Does it hurt?            It's ok.            I'm ok.            Ok.            Ok.          But of course it's not ok. Not by a mile.          Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek.            What?            I'm just... I'm very fond of you.          He grabs her hand and holds it.            I don't suppose you can forget           about it, treat me like I'm not           dying.            I don't think you're dying,           Augustus. You've just got a touch           of cancer.          Gus nods. Squeezes her hand.            Would it be absolutely ludicrous to           make out right now?                                    Hazel doesn't answer. She just kisses him, hard. And on the          two of them, so in love, we CUT TO:                                    Hazel lays on Gus's shoulder as he stares out the window,          leaving Amsterdam behind.                                    As they ride down the escalator, Hazel sees Michael standing          amongst the livery drivers. He holds a sign that says -          instead of someone's last name - ""My Beautiful Family (and          Gus).""          Upon seeing them, he immediately starts to cry of course. He          kisses his wife, gives Hazel a big hug. Gus goes to shake his          hand but Michael hugs him as well. CUT TO:                                    Hazel sits with her father on the couch.            Gus had a recurrence.             Mrs. Waters told us the night           before you left.            I'm sorry Hazel.          They sit for a beat. Tears form in Michael's eyes.            You're not gonna say it?            What's that?            The usual. ""Everything happens for           a reason...""          Michael shakes his head.            I don't know, Haze.            I always thought being an adult           meant knowing what you believe...            ... that has not been my           experience.          Hazel understands exactly. CUT TO:                                     Gus lays in bed, eyes open, a PICC line now being fed through          a port in his chest. Chemotherapy at work.          Hazel and Isaac are keeping him company.            How are your eyes?            Great. Wonderful. I mean, they're           not in my head is the only problem.            I hate to one-up you but... seems           my entire body is made out of           cancer now, so...          Isaac nods. Tries not to get emotional but it's happening. He          goes to touch Gus's arm and accidentally touches his thigh.            Whoa, I'm taken.          Isaac laughs.            (to Hazel, re: Gus)           Did you write his eulogy yet?          Hazel is confused.            Dude.            What?            I haven't asked her.            Oh.            Oops.            What are you talking about?            My bad.             Augustus?          Gus looks at her, grows a little serious.                                      I need speakers at my funeral. I           thought maybe you and Isaac... but           especially you --            Hey!            Would you be kind enough to whip           something up?            (touches his hand)           It would be an honor.          They hold holds.            You guys are adorable.          Hazel play slaps Isaac on the arm.            How's your love life? Anything from           Monica?            Not a word.            She hasn't even like, texted to ask           how you're doing?          He shakes his head. Gus gets an angry look on his face.            That is so messed up!            I've stopped thinking about it.           Moving on. There's a new girl in           Support Group with these humongous -          Isaac gestures to his chest. Hazel is confused.            How do you even know that?            I'm blind but I'm not that blind.            Hazel Grace!          They turn to him.            Do you happen to have four dollars?                                    No one knows what that means. CUT TO:                                    Gus is in the passenger's seat. Isaac sits in the back. Hazel          returns to the car. With a CARTON OF EGGS.            Ok now what?          Gus smiles. CUT TO:                                    Hazel, Gus, and Isaac lean against Hazel's car staring          something down.            Is it there?            Oh it's there.          REVEAL they're looking at Monica's green Firebird.            She's in the house?            Who cares where she is? This is not           about her. This is about you.           (sticks out his hand)           Hazel...          Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg. Gus puts          it in Isaac's hands. Positions Isaac - who, of course, can't          see a thing - towards the Firebird.          Isaac winds up and tosses the EGG.          It misses the car by a mile. After a beat:            I didn't hear anything.            A little to the left.            My throw was to the left or I           should aim to the left?            Aim left.          Isaac turns his shoulders.                                      Lefter.          Isaac turns some more.            Yes! Excellent! And throw hard.          Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it -          missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE.            Bullseye!            Really?            No you missed it by like 20 feet.           (hands him a THIRD)           Try one more time.          Isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight.          Isaac's face lights up.            Woo hoo!          Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a          throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's          enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car          door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses.            Keep throwing, keep throwing!          Isaac does. Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his          mouth. Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment.          Eventually, MONICA'S MOM opens the front door and comes out.            What in God's name --          Seeing Hazel, Gus, and Isaac, she stops in her tracks.            Are you Monica's mom?             I am.            Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done           an injustice and we've come here           seeking revenge. We may not look           like much. Between the three of us,           we have five legs, four eyes, and           two and a half working lungs.              But we also have two dozen eggs. So           If I was you, I would go back           inside.          Monica's Mom is very confused. A beat. Without another word,          she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate.          As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus          on the cheek. And over we hear:            A few days later, Gus landed in the           hospital with chest pains.                                    Hazel bounds in to find Mrs. Waters in the waiting room. She          stands to hug Hazel. They both sit down.            How's he doing?            He's had a tough night, Hazel. His           blood pressure's low. His heart --          Mrs. Waters starts to cry.            What about the chemo?            (shakes her head)           They're gonna stop the chemo.          They both know what that means. Mrs. Waters gathers herself.            Can I see him?             We have to be a family now.          Hazel nods. She understands.            We'll tell him you were here.            If you don't mind, I'll just hang           for a while.          Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy          doors towards Gus's room. Hazel sits in the chair. Same chair          Gus sat in while waiting for her. They've switched places.                                     Hazel pushes Gus, now confined to a WHEELCHAIR, to their spot          on the hill overlooking ""Funky Bones."" A second picnic, this          time with champagne. Hazel pours some for them both into          little Winnie the Pooh cups. She's trying to be upbeat - but          it's difficult. Gus watches the kids play on the bones.            What are you thinking about?            Oblivion.            Augustus...            I know it's kid's stuff but... I           always thought I'd have a grand           story to tell, you know? Something           that would run in all the papers. I           always thought I was special.            You are.            Yeah but... you know what I mean.          Hazel, annoyed finishes her cup, tosses it to the side. Gus          can tell he's said something wrong.            What?            I do know what you mean, I just...           I don't agree.          Hazel stands up, anger building.            This obsession with being             Don't get mad --            But I am mad!            I think you're special, is that not           enough?                                        You think the only way to live a           meaningful life is for everyone to           love you, for everyone to remember           you. Well guess what, Gus, this is           your life. This is all you get. You           get me, and your family, and this           world. And if that's not enough,           well I'm sorry, but it's not           nothing. Cause I'll remember you,           I'll love you --            You're right --            And I just wish... I just wish           you'd be happy with that.            You're right. I'm sorry.           (pulling her back down)           I'm sorry.          Gus hands Hazel another Winnie the Pooh cup. Raises his to          hers in a toast.            It's a good life, Hazel Grace.          She softens. They toast.            It's not over yet, you know.          Gus nods. Of course it isn't. And yet they both know there          isn't much time. CUT TO:                                    Hazel is asleep. Suddenly, her phone buzzes. She looks at it -          ""Gus"" - then she looks at the clock - 2:35am. A pit grows in          her stomach. A quick panicked beat before she answers:            Hello?             Hazel Grace.             Oh, thank God. Hi. Hi, I love you!            I'm at the gas station --                                      What?            Something's wrong. You gotta...           please come help me.                                    Hazel drives like a maniac down the street, eventually          finding herself at the Speedway gas station.          Gus's car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next          to it. She gets out of her car, opens his driver's side door,          and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and          blood. She gags from the smell.             Hi.          Hazel looks down at his hands which are pressed tightly to          his belly. She sees something is leaking from the TUBE          sticking out of it.             Oh, God, Augustus, I'm calling 911.            No! Please! Hazel, listen to me. Do           not call 911 or my parents -- I'll           never forgive you -- Don't, please.          Gus starts to cry.            Please just look at it.          Hazel lifts up his shirt. His ABDOMEN is bright red.            I think it's infected...          Hazel feels his forehead, he's burning up.            Gus, what the -- why are you here?           Why aren't you home?          Gus throws up. He doesn't even have the energy to turn his          mouth away from his lap.            Oh, sweetie...            I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I           lost my pack. Or they took it.              I don't know. They said they'd get           me another one but I wanted... to           do it myself. Do one little thing           myself.          Hazel doesn't know what to do.            I can't fix this. I have to call           someone. I'm sorry.            No, Hazel, please!          But she must. She gets out her cell phone and dials. At which          point, Gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying          teenage boy that he is. As Hazel dials, we hear:            I wish I could say Augustus Waters           kept his sense of humor till the           end, did not for a moment waiver in           his courage and his spirit soared           like an eagle to the sky...            (to himself, shaking)           I hate myself I hate myself I hate           this I hate this...            ...but that is not what happened.          LATER. An EMT loads Gus into the back of an AMBULANCE. Hazel          is allowed to ride with him in the back. As the car starts          moving, Gus grabs her hand.            Read me something.            Read you something?            Do you know any poems?            I know one.            Read it to me.            ""The Red Wheelbarrow"" by William           Carlos Williams.           (beat, tries to remember)           ""So much depends / upon / a red           wheel / barrow / glazed with rain /           water / beside the white /           chickens.""                                       Is that it?          That is it. But there's another ten minutes of driving to do.          Hazel thinks fast.            No of course not. Um... what           else...            so much depends/ upon a blue sky/           cut open by the branches/ of the           trees./ So much depends/ on the           transparent G-tube/ erupting from           the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy.          Gus smiles, weakly, barely conscious. Hazel cradles his head          in her arms. And continues...            So much depends upon this observer/           of the universe...          As Gus is drifting off to sleep, WE HEAR:            One of the less bull-shitty           conventions of the cancer genre is           the convention known as the ""Last           Good Day...""                                    Gus comes home from the hospital. He does not look good - but          he lives. Hazel is there to help get him inside.                                    Gus no longer sleeps in his basement. Nor does he sleep in          his own bed. He sleeps in a HOSPITAL BED set up in a guest          room. Hazel is with him. They're watching sports on TV.            This is where the victim of cancer           finds himself unexpectedly with           some hours...                                    Hazel and Gus getting some fresh air. She sits there reading          a book. Gus just sits there. His eyes staring off into          nothing. Hazel waves to him. Gus looks over, as if waking          from a dream. She manages a smile. He manages one back.                                      ... when it seems like the           inexorable decline has suddenly           plateaued, when the pain is for a           minute bearable.                                    Hazel sits at dinner with her parents. She is barely touching          her food.            The problem, of course, is that           there's no way of knowing that your           last good day is your ""Last Good           Day."" At the time, it's just           another decent day.          The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it.            Hi, Augustus.            Good evening, Hazel Grace.          His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it.            Quick question for you. Did you           ever write that eulogy I asked you           to prepare?            I may have...            Excellent. Do you think you could           find yourself at the Literal Heart           of Jesus in 20 minutes.            Um... sure. Is everything --            I love you Hazel.          The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go.            I gotta go.            Finish eating first.            I can't, I have to meet Gus.                                      You haven't eaten a thing.            I'm not hungry.            You can't not eat, Hazel.            I am aggressively unhungry, ok?              I have to go.            Sit down.            No!            Hazel, listen to your mother.          Hazel tries to push past her but Frannie grabs her shoulders.            You have to eat, Hazel. You're not           gonna starve yourself to death just           because Gus is sick. You have to           stay healthy --            I can't! I can't stay healthy           because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am           dying. I am going to die and leave           you here alone and you won't have           me to hover around and you won't be           a mother anymore, and I'm sorry,           but I can't do anything about it,           ok?! Just leave me alone!          Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately          regrets this.            You heard me?          Frannie has tears in her eyes. Hazel looks away, feeling          terrible.            You heard me say that to your           father?          Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter.                                      Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was           wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not           something I believe.          Michael sits across from them.            As long as either of us is alive, I           will be your mother. Even if you           die, I --            When.            Even when you die, I will still be           your mother. I will always be your           Mother.          By now Michael is crying too. They all are.            I worry that you won't have a life.           That you'll sit around all day with           no me to look after and stare at           the walls and be miserable or off           yourselves or something.            We're not gonna off ourselves. It's           gonna hurt like hell to lose you             Hazel. You of all people know it's           possible to live with pain.          She takes that in. It rings true to her. Hazel nods.            I don't just sit around, you know.          Hazel is confused. Frannie looks at Michael like, ""should I          say something?"" She goes for it.            I'm taking some classes. Online. To           get my master's in social work.            You are?          Hazel is stunned.            So when you're waiting for me           outside Support Group or whatever,           you're always --                                      Working or reading. If I get my           MSW, I can council families in           crisis or lead groups dealing with             Why didn't you tell me?          Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say.            We didn't want you to feel             Are you kidding? Mom, this is           awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my           god!          Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug.            I'm so excited! You're gonna be so           great, Mom!            Thank you. That means everything to           me.          Mom and Daughter hug. And when it's over:            I'd still really like you to eat.            I know Mom. And I will. I promise.           But right now... I really gotta go.                                    Hazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now          empty except for Isaac, up on a dais, and Gus, in his          wheelchair. Gus is thinner than we've ever seen him, thinner          than any young man should be. But for now, he's happy.            Hazel Grace, you look ravishing.            I know, right?            So, um, what's going on guys?            You're late.            Late for what exactly?                                    Gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does.            I wanted to attend my funeral. By           the way, will you speak at my           funeral?          Hazel looks at him like ""of course, silly"" and then kisses          him on the mouth.            Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to           attend as a ghost, but just to make           sure, I thought I'd - well, not to           put you on the spot, but I thought           I'd arrange a pre-funeral.            Why now?            No time like the present.            (looks around the room)           How did you even get in here?            Would you believe they leave the           door open at night?            Um, no.            As well you shouldn't.          He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus. Hazel laughs.          Isaac clears his throat.            ""Augustus Waters was a self-           aggrandizing bastard. But we           forgive him. We forgive him... not           because he had a heart as           figuratively good as his actual one           sucked, or because he got 18 years           when he should have gotten more.""              I'm assuming you've got some time,           you interrupting bastard! I mean           seriously...           (back to the speech)           ""Augustus Waters talked so much           that he'd interrupt you at his own           funeral. And he was pretentious.              Sweet Jesus that kid never took a           piss without pondering the           resonances of human waste           production. And he was vain. But           that comes with superhuman           handsomeness.""          Gus nods - that part is true.            ""But I will say this: when the           scientists of the future show up at           my house with robot eyes and they           tell me to try them on, I will tell           the scientists to piss off, because           I don't even want to see a world           without Augustus Waters.""          Hazel smiles - but it's one that triggers an immediate          emotional waterfall.            ""And then, of course, having made           my rhetorical point, I will put my           robot eyes on because, I mean...           robot eyes!""          Gus has a big smile on his face.            ""So anyway, Augustus, my friend...           Godspeed.""          Gus nods a couple times.            Thank you Isaac.          This causes Isaac to lose it. He clings to the lectern.            Goddamn it, Gus.            Hey don't swear in the Literal           Heart of Jesus.            Shit! Ass! Balls!          Isaac sighs. Wipes away the tears. And another beat passes.            Can I get a hand here, Hazel?          Hazel remembers Isaac can't see. She rises, goes up to get          him, walks him back to her seat.            Hazel Grace, it's down to you.                                    Hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. Takes          a beat to ready herself.            ""Augustus Waters was the great star-           crossed love of my life. Ours was           an epic love story, and I won't be           able to get more than a sentence           into it without disappearing into a           puddle of tears.            Like all real love stories - ours           will die with us, as it should. I'd           hoped that he'd be eulogizing me,           because there's no one I'd rather           have...""          And that's all she can get out before falling apart. She lets          it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together.            (beat, composing herself)           ""I can't talk about our love story           so instead I will talk about math.           I am not a mathematician, but I           know this: there are infinite           numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1           And .12 And .112 And an infinite           collection of others. Of course,           there is a bigger infinite set of           numbers between 0 and 2, or between           0 and a million. Some infinities           are bigger than other infinities. A           writer we used to like taught us           that. I want more numbers than I'm           likely to get, and God, I want more           numbers for Augustus Waters than he           got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot           tell you how thankful I am for our           little infinity. You gave me a           forever within the numbered days,           and for that I am eternally           grateful. I love you.""          Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO:           Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE.                                    Hazel turns on the LIGHT by her bed. Her HOUSE PHONE is          ringing and it's 4am.          She knows instantly.                                      Augustus Waters died eight days           later in the ICU...          Hazel's head falls into her chest.            ... when the cancer, which was made           of him, stopped his heart, which           was also made of him.          Her bedroom door opens. It's Frannie and Michael. This only          confirms her worst fears. She starts to cry. Her parents          embrace her in the bed.            It was unbearable. The whole thing.           Every second worse than the last.                                    Hazel sits in the car in the dark. She's blaring the loudest          music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the          horrors of the world. Over which we hear this:            One of the first things they ask           you in the ER is to rate your pain           on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been           asked this question hundreds of           times and I remember once, early           on, when I couldn't catch my breath           and it felt like my chest was on           fire, and the nurse asked me to           rate the pain and though I couldn't           speak, I held up 9 fingers.          The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.          She falls apart nonetheless.            Later on, when I'd been feeling           better, the nurse came in and she           called me a fighter. ""You know how           I know,"" she said. ""Because you           called a ten a nine.""                                    Hazel puts on her funeral dress. She looks in the mirror.            But that wasn't the truth. The           reason I called it a nine was... I           was saving my ten.                                     The place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters.          Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back,          watching people she's never seen before approach the Waters          family and extend their deepest condolences.            And this was it. The great and           terrible ten.          When Mr. and Mrs. Waters see Hazel, they open their arms.            He loved you so much.          Hazel nods. Hugs them back.            He loved you so much too.          More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in          the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's          not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep          breath, wills herself to walk towards it.          Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.          Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches          herself.            It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.          She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.          Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights          and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of          the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.            I think we're ready to begin.          Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in          the middle of the room.            Augustus Waters fought hard for           many years. His battle was a           courageous one and his strength was           a source of inspiration for each           and every one of us...          Hazel frowns. This is all such bullshit. And she hears:            What a load of shit, eh kid?          Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn't make sense. She          turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten.                                      Let us pray.          Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps          staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.            We need to fake pray now.          Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns          back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected          appearance.            Now I call on Augustus's close           friend Isaac to say a few words.          Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help.          Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it's really          him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.            Of all the things I've lost in my           life, this hurts the most.          And Isaac stops talking. It's unclear if that was the end or          if he just can't go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister          walks back up.            And now we'll hear from Gus's...           special friend Hazel Lancaster.          Hazel stands, walks up to the podium. A few titters in the          room at the words ""special friend.""            I was his girlfriend.          Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.            There's a beautiful quote in Gus's           home that reads ""if you want the           rainbow, you gotta deal with the           rain.""          Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:            I didn't believe a word, of course.           But that was ok. Funerals, I'd           decided, aren't for the dead.           They're for the living.          Gus's Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. CUT TO:                                     Everyone is watching Gus's body be lowered into the ground.          Everyone but Hazel. She looks off into the distance.          Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the          burial. He's watching Hazel. CUT TO:          LATER. Ceremony over, we see Hazel with her parents.            I'll be fine.            Are you sure? We can drive you --            No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for           a while.          Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot.          As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.            Could I hitch a ride?          Hazel doesn't want to help this man.            Just to the bottom of the hill.          Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they're both in the car:            How did you even --            The internet.            And you just... bought a ticket?            The drinks are free drinks in First           Class.          Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a          swig. Hazel shakes her head in disgust. Starts driving.            Omnis Cellula e cellula.          Hazel ignores him.            Your boy Waters and I corresponded           quite a bit in his last --            You read your fan mail now?                                      I would hardly call him a fan. He           despised me. But he was quite           insistent I attend his funeral and           tell you what became of Anna and           her mother. So here I am and that's           your answer: omnis cellula e           cellula.            I'm so not in the mood --            ""Life comes from life.""            Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.            You don't want an explanation?            Nope. Thanks though. Have a great           life.            You remind me of her.             I remind a lot of people of a lot           of people.            She was eight, my daughter. She           suffered... beautifully. For so           long.          Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens.            She had leukemia? Like Anna?            Just like her, yes.            Were you married then?            Not when she died, no. I was           insufferable long before Anna, my           dear. Grief doesn't change you,           Hazel, it reveals you.          Hazel takes that in.            Well I'm sorry for your loss.                                      And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry           for everything, for being so rude           to you two, for ruining your trip --            You didn't ruin our trip, you           asshole. We had an awesome trip.            Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You           asked me to tell you what happens           and I wish I could do that. I wish           that I could. But I can't. No one           can. No one knows, Hazel. They           don't talk to us. Unless...          Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to          Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball.            You think I care about that? I           don't give a shit, Van Houten.          Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.            You're a drunk and a jerk and a           failure. And I'd like you to get           out of my car right now so I can go           home and grieve.               Get out of the car!          Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told,          stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands          there as Hazel peels out.          In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if          toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO:                                    Hazel lies in front of the TV. ""Top Model"" is playing but          she's lost in her own world. Tears fall from her eyes and she          can't do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up.                                    Hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps. Soon          there's a knock.                                       Occupada.            Can I come in?          Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down          next to her, putting her head on his shoulder.          Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more.          Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn't cry.            I'm so so sorry.            It was a privilege to love him,           though, wasn't it?          Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad.            Gives you an idea how we feel about           you.          Michael smiles at Hazel. And he doesn't cry. Hazel draws          strength from him.                                    Hazel and Isaac have climbed through his open bedroom window.          They sit on the roof.            Do you know if it hurt or whatever?            He was really fighting for breath,           I guess. He eventually went           unconscious, but it seems like,           yeah, it wasn't great or anything.           Dying sucks.             It just seems so impossible.            Happens all the time.            Are you angry?            Very.                                      Me too.           (a few beats)           Gus really loved you, you know.            I know.            He wouldn't shut up about it.            I know.            It was annoying.            I didn't find it that annoying.          They sit there in silence a few beats.            Did you read the note or whatever           from your author friend?            He is not my friend and -- how do           you know about that?            We talked at the cemetery. Said he           came all this way to give you that.            Yeah well I'm over it. I never want           to read another word of that           asshole's again.            Yeah but he didn't write it - Gus           did.             What?            That's what he said. Gus had           written something, sent it to Van           Hazel sits up. Her heart is racing.            What?            I... I have to go. I... Are you...?                                      I do it all the time. Go.          As quickly as possible Hazel leaves. Isaac stays behind,          enjoying the cool night. A new day is coming.                                    Hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash          in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She's about to          give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath          the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and          unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:            Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person           but a shitty writer. You're a           shitty person but a good writer.           We'd make a good team. I don't want           to ask you any favors but if you           have the time, and from what I saw           you have plenty, please fix this           for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.          Hazel is overcome with emotion.            She asked me to write one and I'm           trying, I just, I could use a           little flair. See the thing is...           we all want to be remembered.          She smiles to herself, remembering:          - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.          - The staring contest in Support Group.            We all want to leave a mark.          - Driving (badly) in Gus's car.          - Their first kiss at the picnic by ""Funky Bones.""            But not Hazel. Hazel is different.           Hazel knows the truth. She didn't           want a million admirers, she just           wanted one. And she got it. Maybe           she wasn't loved widely but she was           loved deeply. And isn't that more           than most of us get?          - And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes.            When Hazel was sick, I knew I was           dying. But I didn't want to say so.                                     Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the ICU.          She sleeps. He kneels by her side.            She was in ICU and I snuck in for           ten minutes and sat with her before           I got caught. Her eyes were closed,           her lungs were intubated...          Gus takes her hand and holds it.            ... but her hands were still her           hands, still warm, and the nails           painted this dark blue back color           and I just held her hands and I           willed myself to imagine a world           without us and what a worthless           world that would be.          - AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that          story, never knew he was there. CUT TO:                                    Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen          tank dragging behind her. She lays down on the grass and          looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.            She's so beautiful. You don't get           tired of looking at her. You never           worry if she's smarter than you           cause you know she is. She's funny           without ever being mean.           - The magical dinner at Oranjee.          - The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.          - The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house.          - Falling onto the bed together.          [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the          movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we          SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make          these images less beautiful. They make them twice as          beautiful - because they're real.]            I love her, god I love her. I'm so           lucky to love her, Van Houten.              You don't get to choose if you get           hurt in this world but you do have           a say in who hurts you.          - AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass. She holds the letter to her          chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.            I like my choices. I hope she likes           hers.          Hazel CLOSES HER EYES.            Ok, Hazel Grace?          A beat. Another.          Hazel OPENS HER EYES. And she says to the universe:            Ok.       Fault in Our Stars, The   :    Scott Neustadter    Michael H.

"    STEPMOM   Ronald Bass  Second Revised Draft  Previous Drafts by:  Gigi Levangie  Elizabeth Chandler  Jessie Nelson &  Steven Rogers    	A billowy white screen.  An alarm clock BLARES.  As MAIN TITLES	BEGIN, the lovely sleeping face of RACHEL KELLY rolls into frame.	Then out of it.  Alarm keeps BLASTING.  Back she comes, pulling the	sheets OVER her head.  Motionless now, as we hear...	... the DEAFENING SILENCE of the alarm shutting off.  A beat.	Rachel SITS BOLTS UPRIGHT.  LEAPS out of the room.  From the back	we see that she's dressed only in a pair of men's boxers.	She makes it halfway down the hall, does a U TURN back into the	bedroom, frantically YANKS a robe hanging from the door, taking the	wall hook WITH her.  She FLINGS her robe on as she RUNS down the	hall, wall hook STICKING OUT of her back.  BURSTING INTO...  		Ben!  You overslept again damn it!	The room looks like a 6 (but I'm almost 7) year old exploded.	Posters of MAGICIANS on all the walls.  Rachel darts about the room	mismatching the clothes she forgot to arrange the night before. 		Get Up Get Up Get Up!	The LUMP under the cover doesn't move. 		Ben you're late.  I'm serious.  I'm		wearing a very serious face.  Don't		make me start counting ONE...	No movement.  Rachel tugs the sleeve of a shirt hanging on a chair,	and out comes a magician's bouquet of FLOWERS. 	She pulls a dirty handkerchief out of the pocket of the shirt --	it's an endless MAGICIAN'S HANDKERCHIEF. 		Don't make me say three I'm about to		say three.			(a beat, then)		Three!	She RIPS the covers off and a blow-up DINOSAUR sleeps in Ben's	place. 		Ben I'm not kidding around.  You make		yourself appear this instant!	A WHITE BUNNY saunters across her toes.  Rachel SCREAMS -- then	gathers her wits and searches under the bed -- under the bureau --	she opens the closet doors and shoving clothes aside. 		You might think this is funny but this		is actually NOT funny.	Unseen by Rachel, six-year-old BEN sits, perched on the highest	closet shelf, knees under his chin, holding his breath.  His eyes	gleeful as Rachel frantically closes the closet door. 	Rachel hops over the Bunny, navigates through strewn toys and books	STUBBING her baby toe.  She limps in agony past a big picture of	the kids with their daddy and heads towards a door with a KEEP OUT	EVERYONE! sign. 			(bellowing)  	ANNABELLE, 10 years old, sits on the edge of her bed, fuming, all	of her limbs crossed.  She holds up a filthy purple tee shirt. 		You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I		told you a hundred times it was Purple		Day at school today. 		I didn't forget.  I was up all night 		thinking about it and I concluded you're 		too special to look like everyone else.			(she grabs an orangey 			 red tee shirt)		Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few 		can carry it off.  Now please.  Help 		me find your brother. 		You lost Ben?! 		Of course not.  Does he look lost to 		you?			(big breath)  	Rachel, smoking a cigarette and drinking a diet coke, FLINGS open	pantry doors, closet doors -- looking for Ben -- attempting to put	stone hard butter on toast at the same time.  She glances at the	clock -- 7:55.  Oh dear.  Annabelle sits at the table, in a grumpy	orangey red mood.  Rachel hands her what was once a piece of toast. 		No.  I told you.  I like apple butter		not butter butter. 			(hands her an apple)		Here. 		Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch. 			(forgot)		I'm almost done making it.			(to the non-existent Ben)		Alright Ben --  you  deal with the tardy,		 you  write yourself a note, your daddy		 told  you he had an important case this		morning and he had to leave early and 		we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!	She has opened a cupboard with a Lazy Susan that turns revealing	BEN sitting there.  Rachel screams AGAIN! 		Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're		late.  You're really late.  Now get out		here and have some cereal. 		No. 		Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.	She hands him a bowl of sugared cereal -- puts two spoonfuls of	instant coffee in Barney cup, and sticks it under the faucet. 		No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops		on the bottom. 		Fine.	Rachel grabs the bowl, turn it UPSIDE DOWN on the table reversing	the order of the cereal.  She SWEEPS it back in the bowl and	quickly hands it back to him, the phone RINGS THROUGHOUT... 		You touched it. 		Then have a donut -- 		No. 		Alright starve. 		I'm gonna beep daddy at work. 		He's badgering a witness.  Eat. 		But you told us to starve. 			(picking up phone)		Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's		already there?...I'm out the door...			(Ben flings a fruit loop			 at her)		Ben!  Knock it off!			(into phone)		It's gonna go beautifully...			(another fruit loop)		Damn it Ben --	Rachel runs around absentmindedly loading out leftover pizza, 	Hoho's, and Chips.  She glances at the clock again -- 8:00. 		You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did		you remember my egg carton?  I told		you I needed my egg carton for seed		planting today. 		Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of		everything.	Rachel takes the eggs from the fridge, and dumps them -- accidentally	missing the sink.  They SHATTER onto the floor.  She hands the empty	carton to Annabelle. 		...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --			(she hangs up, panicked)		We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which		means Mister Ben we've got to get you 		dressed -- 		No!	Ben races away but Rachel LUNGES And CATCHES him.  He wiggles in	her arms as she struggles to change his clothes.  Just as she gets	his bottoms off she drops his clothes in the pile of gooey eggs	when we hear a loud KNOCKING at the kitchen door.  Holding a half	naked Ben in her arms, Rachel looks up at...	JACKIE HARRISON.  An immaculately dressed, intimidatingly intel-	ligent, utterly beautiful woman staring at her with extreme	disapproval. 		Mommy!	Annabelle and Ben RACE into their mother's arms like little angels.	Jackie shoots a fiercely protective glare at Rachel.  They LOCK	eyes.  Enough wattage to light up all of Manhattan. 	Jackie and the kids exit Rachel's building, onto a bustling Soho	street.  The kids clamber into the double-parked Volvo wagon.	Jackie, still pissed, climbs behind the wheel.  Drives off. 	Jackie drives the children down a tree-lined street in Englewood,	New Jersey.  Ben is banging Jackie's sunglasses case against the	window. 		...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red		and Blue make purple. 			(yes she does)		I don't care. 		I know you don't, but if you had, chrom-		atically you  are  in the purple family.	Jackie fishes through her purse.  Finds a toy airplane for Ben.  He	stops banging her glasses case, starts banging the plane. 		Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants?		Doesn't she have underpants of her own? 		I noticed a whopping pile of laundry		sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's		underpants are in there -- Now where are		your lunches?	As if by rote, they hold out their lunches.  One is a plastic Vons	bag and the other a crumpled Macy's bag.  She collects them and	hands Ben and Annabelle two brightly colored lunch bags. 		Annabelle sucked her thumb last night. 		I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!	And SLUGS him. 		 Never  say 'never' -- it's  not  fair to		say 'always' -- and  no  name calling.		Use your words. 		I hate when you say that. 		Thank you.  Those were all words.  I		hate the planet Uranus.   Terrible  name		for a planet.	Annabelle and Ben look up at her curiously. 		I hate snails and blue cheese.		Especially together.   Hate . 		I have lava. 			(reflects)		Lava's hateable.  I never thought of		that. 		I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make		me want to throw up. 		Excellent point. 		I hate wax lips and red ants and		pretzels without salt... 		I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and		people who spit when they walk.	Jackie nods sagely.  Pulls up next to a school playground. 		I hate to say goodbye.  Eskimo Kiss.			(they rub noses)		Russian Orthodox Wedding Kiss.	They bump foreheads and elbows.  Ben runs toward the kindergarten	playground; Jackie watches concerned as Annabelle climbs the steps.	The only orangey red dot in a sea of purple. 	Taxi pulls up to a converted warehouse.  Rachel BOLTS out, 	SPRINTING for the door. 	Black and white FILLS the frame.  Like a checkerboard.  We PULL	BACK and realize we are seeing a group of PENGUINS waddling against	a black and white backdrop.  We see a WHITE WAITRE'D in a BLACK	TUXEDO holding glasses on a tray.  A BLACK MODEL, IMAN, in a WHITE	DRESS glides through it all.	In the center the only dash of color is Rachel -- who has just	entered and starts expertly directing the action.  She calls out to	her assistant, COOPER.  Perpetually hip.  Perpetually young. 		Cooper, back the fill off I don't have		enough shadow... 		You've got a fruit loop in your hair. 		You say that like I don't know that. 		I once threw an entire bowl of jello		on my stepmother's head -- 		And when did that pass? 		Actually, never.  They'll always hate		you.  There's a gene for it.	DUNCAN SAMUELS -- Rachel's boss, an elegant, edgy, Englishman	interrupts them. 		Congratulations.  Only forty minutes		late.  You're handling this promotion		really well Rachel. 		Duncan.  My work is everything to me.		This'll never happen again.  Now stand		back -- this session's gonna make you		remember why you hired me even though		I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper		let's get these penguins dancing --	Duncan backs off, charmed by her ballsiness.  The music BLARES just	then, and a penguin JUTS forward and NIPS the model.  The FLASH of	the camera.  We FREEZE for a second, seeing the photo Rachel just	took.  An Avedonesque portrait of a model being GOOSED by a penguin	COLLIDING with a maitre'd who SPILLS his tray and the penguins seem	to be POINTING and LAUGHING uproariously.  It's an inspired photo. 	Jackie and LUKE HARRISON -- ruggedly handsome man, mid-forties,	charming, disarming, and smart as they come.  They sit side by side	on a couch across from RUTH FRANKLIN, an Elementary School Counselor 		Mr. and Mrs. Harrison, while change is		exhilarating for adults, it can be 		quite challenging for a child.	Luke's beeper beeps.  He ignores it; focuses on Mr. Franklin. 		I won't get that...It's fine.  Change.		we were talking about change. 		The fact that you two are remarrying		obviously has Annabelle overjoyed...			(they look at her,			 dumbfounded)		And she's very excited about your move to		Switzerland. 		She said we're getting remarried?	Suddenly -- a long bell rings -- Jackie STANDS UP, startled. 		Only a fire drill.  My concern is that		Annabelle seems apathetic towards her		work knowing she's leaving before the		end of the semester. 		Mrs. Franklin we're not -- 		Planning on getting -- 		Remarried.  There is no move. 			(trying to appear unfazed)		Really?  Well then my concern for --	Luke's beeper BEEPS again.  They talk right over Mrs. Franklin... 		Are you here? 		I'm here. 		Because you don't really seem here. 		I'm here.  I've got a case where they're		this close to sequestering the jury but		have I answered the goddamn thing?! 		Something's up wi... 		You think I didn't get that?	She cuts a look at Mrs. Franklin. 		Excuse him.  He never learned how		to turn the darn thing off.	And reaches.  Does it for him. 		I'm wondering if there's anything going		on at home that could be intensifying		Annabelle's need to create this fantasy?	Long pause.  Then suddenly they both start speaking AT ONCE. 		I've been with someone for quite some		time, and didn't feel it was appropriate		for her to move in too quickly.  But		after a lot of thought and careful		discussion with her -- and the kids I		might add -- she moved in last month. 		Since our divorce Luke has seen a		number of different women in three		short years and without a lot of		warning for the kids, he's now living		with a woman half his age -- 		Rachel's not half my age. 		We're not discussing your age. 		Well, we're not discussing Rachel's		age either. 		They want to be with you Luke, they go		to your house to be with their father. 		Jackie, they come to be part of my		life.  Rachel  is  part of that life. 		Mr. Harrison, I hear you talking about		your life, your needs, but are you		really in touch with what Annabelle		needs? 			(suddenly fierce)		This man would walk thru fire for		Annabelle, gladly, any day of the week. 		Napalm. 		Except for last Thursday when Rachel		forgot to pick them up -- 		Jackie, she was five minutes late -- 		I'm wondering if Annabelle is responding		to the underlying hostility that exists		between Rachel and Mrs. Harrison... 		Of course she's responding to it.  You		think it's easy for any of us?  You think		it's easy for Jackie to watch her kids		being looked after by someone who has		half the experience she does?  Of course		she's going to be hostile, irrational,		and defensive. 		Thank you Luke.	Mrs. Franklin doesn't quite know what to say.  The bell RINGS. 		Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?			(they get up)		This has been very valuable for us.  And		I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle		tonight. 		It's Wednesday night.  She's at my		house.  I'll talk to her. 		I'll call from work.  We can have a		conference call. 		You tried that last week and we were		on hold forty-five minutes...	And they're out the door.  You can hear the fight as it echoes down	the elementary school hallway. 	Jackie and Luke exit the pleasant suburban school.  Head for the	parking area... 		You ask me that counselor's making		a mountain out of a molehill... 		I'm worried. 		Me too. 		Luke, I need to switch next Friday for		Thursday, so why don't you take the		weekend...			(pointedly)		...that way you'll be there, and I'll		pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. 		Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids		to work with me on Wednesday so I'll		take Wednesday, and you can pick up		that Thursday, Friday after soccer,		and Saturday before riding. 		Easy enough. 		Good...Well...Take care.	As if on automatic pilot they move in to kiss each other goodbye	then stop.  Each takes a step back.  15 years of hellos and	goodbyes.  A beat.  A wave.  They head their separate ways. 	Establishing shot of Jackie's lovely home on its lovely street.	Old trees.  Comfortable front lawns.  Safe and happy.  A place to	grow kids, dogs, probably walruses, even.  We PUSH toward the warm	glow from within this home... 	Jackie setting the table.  Annabelle recording the moment with her	omnipresent VIDEO CAMERA... 		I didn't say that.  Why would I say		that? 		Well Daddy and I were thinking that		sometimes people tell a story about		what they wish would happen. 		I don't want that to happen.  Why		would I want that to happen? 		Well you're telling your teachers and		your friends -- 		Mass hysteria. 		Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in. 		I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset? 		Look if the truth is you don't feel like		talking about this right now that's fine.		But don't look me in the eye with a big		smile on your face and lie to me.		Cause there are only so many lies you're		allowed to tell before it starts showing		on your face.  You wind up looking like...	She stops.  It's just too horrible. 		Like who? 		Well, he's not president anymore, so		why be petty.	Ben enters in white gloves and Jackie's scarf. 		Pick a card.  Any card.	Jackie picks a card. 		It just slipped out. 		It happens. 			(a beat)		What happens when he loves Rachel more		than us? 		That will never happen. 		Never say never you always say that.		I'll bet daddy's mad at me now. 		Queen of diamonds. 		Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just		want to talk about it. 		I'm gonna call him. 		Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there.		That's one time always is always.  You		can call him after dinner but...	Annabelle RUNS out of the room.  Jackie watches her sadly.  Ben	hits Jackie hard with his magic wand. 		Poof!  You're happy now. 		Thank you Ben.			(unhappily)		Annabelle!	Ben finds himself alone in the kitchen.  He hits himself on the	head, hard.  Poof!  He begins to serve himself dinner.  Alone. 	Rachel and Luke exit a neighborhood bistro.  Stroll down the	street... 			(irritated)		Okay, if they're going to  have  a		sauce, put something  in  it besides		flour and chicken broth... 			(quietly)		It was a veal stock, I thi... 		Well, it wasn't a reduction like		you do it!  Boiling down half a		ton of bones...	Luke is thinking of something.  She's watching that. 		The way you cook.  If you could		make love, I'd marry you. 			(softly)		We have to talk. 			(happy)		Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all		of a sudden...			(ominous Nazi Baritone)		Ve  haff  to ta... 		I didn't want to spoil our supper... 		You'd rather spoil our walk home. 		Yeh, it's cheaper.	Okay, what? 		I just found out I have to go to		Boston to get a deposition.  I might		not be back until Saturday. 			(mock horror)		So I'll have to order in? 			(dropping the other shoe)		We have the kids this weekend, so... 			(softly)		Jesus.	He glances over... 		I thought it was  her  weekend.  Do I		 ever  see you alone?	He draws a breath.  The concern is behind his eyes. 		Anyway, I thought...while I'm		gone...maybe I'll hire in some help. 		For what? 		Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're		working... 		I can take them to work with me -- I		can shift things around -- 		You don't need to.  I don't expect you		to handle them yourself. 		Can't handle them myself is what you		mean.  Can't.	Maybe she's right.  Because he doesn't say anything. 		You don't trust me to be alone with		them. 		I trust you of course I do but --  		But?  But what? 		But you're not good at this.  Not yet.		I'm sorry. 		I know how responsible, caring adults		parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But		'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.	He loves her.  But this problem is real. 		Look.  I know they hate me. 		They don't hate you -- 		And what you're telling them is keep		hating her -- keep up the good work -- 		Nobody's telling them to hate you -- 		Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes. 		It's complicated for Jackie.  It's		complicated for me...You don't have		kids -- you don't understand -- 			(angry now)		Oh right...So it's just complicated for		you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty		simple cause I just don't understand... 		No you don't.  And I'm not gonna		screw with my kids heads right now -- 		You know I don't need another person in		this family making me feel like an		idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up		job and I have to face it every Tuesday		and Thursday and every other goddamn		weekend and I just don't know how the		hell you were married to her for so		goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in		her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get		it.	They've reached their building.  As they enter... 		She's a great mother. 	The door of the freight elevator CLANGS open.  As Rachel and Luke	step out into their loft, the phone is RINGING.	She looks to Luke.  Then RUNS to SNATCH it up... 		Hello? 	Annabelle with a phone in her closet.  Hearing Rachel, she hangs	up.  A pink POST IT creeps under the door.  CAN I JOIN YOU FOR  	The most beautiful little puppy in the world -- sitting in a puddle	of pee on a hardwood floor. 		Aw George...not again... who wants to		help clean up this time?			(overly zealous)		Annabelle?	She looks around -- completely exhausted.  It's late.  Annabelle is	video taping the dog pee.  Ben's in the kitchen talking to himself.	He pours and sprinkles, working intently on a MAGIC POTION. 		Why do you make that face when you talk		to me?			(she imitates Rachel)		And that voice you use...you think I'm 		deaf or something?	Ben ZAPS the magic potion theatrically with his fingertips. 			(reaching for her)		I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi... 		Don't touch me!  I'm  allergic  to you!	She starts sneezing furiously and scratching.  Ben comes out of the	kitchen carrying a steaming cup of potion. 		""Those who travel far and near this		will make you DISAPPEAR!"" 		I have to work on my video project!		Don't follow me!  I can put myself to		bed.	She races upstairs.  Rachel follows.  So does Ben.  And George. 		Excuse me -- 			(following into 			 Annabelle's room)		Annabelle let's get something clear. 		I don't have to listen to you!  You're		not my mother. 		Thank God for that!	She leaves the room SLAMMING the door behind her.  Takes a breath,	turns, and walks back in. 		What I meant and perhaps I didn't say		it well was you have a great mom.  You		don't need another one.  But when		you're at this house -- 		This is my daddy's house -- 		This is my house too! 		And this is my room so get out! 		Excuse me.	Rachel throws open the door.  Ben stands there innocently. 		I made you some cocoa.  See? 		Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of		you.			(pointedly to Annabelle)		Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.	Rachel leads Ben to his room.  With Rachel safe out of sight,	Annabelle takes the puppy into her arms and cuddles it. 	Rachel, dead on his feet, reads ""Goodnight Moon"" to Ben. 		""In the great green room there was a		telephone and a red balloon..."" 		Aren't you going to drink your cocoa?		It's the good kind. 			(faking a big sip)		Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben.		Just like your dad.	Ben points to the book -- she 'reads' skipping pages, a hundred	miles an hour desperate to get to the end of the book. 		""Goodnight moon, goodnight hush,		goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight		goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben! 		No!  You're cheating -- you have to start		from the beginning and you have to read		the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.	Ben's eyes are glued to her.  She lays down next to him, yawns. 		""In the great green room there was a		telephone and a red balloon..."" 		""And a picture of the cow jumping over		the moon..."" 			(laying head down)		That's nice Ben.	Ben reads until Rachel's asleep.  He looks at her in AWE. 		Rachel!  Rachel!	No response.  Rachel's really asleep.  He lifts her head.  It flops	down!  In HORROR he jumps off the bed and with a quick look back,	races from the room, and...	...DARTS down the hallway, BUMPING into walls -- He LEAPS inside	Annabelle's room, SLAMMING the door behind him. 		Ben!  What's wrong? 			(triumphantly)		I killed her!	Ben and Annabelle gape at one another, stunned. 	Rachel pulls up FAST in Luke's Grand Cherokee.  As she SCREECHES to	a stop, the kids pile out with their gear.	Rachel takes an anxious look toward Jackie's place.  Here we go. 	The clock reads 8:10.  Rachel and the kids enter.  Annabelle's hair	is brushed forward, hiding her face.  Ben is ebullient.  Jackie's	edgy, ready to snap. 		How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10.		You were supposed to be here at 7:00.		She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride. 		This is Friday, her riding lesson is		on Tuesdays. 			(pulls out post it)		I got it right here... 		Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of		the month when it's switched to Friday		except in April when she rides on		Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't		you have a mother? 			(flinching)		Can I please have a cup of coffee? 		We don't have any coffee. 		What is this?  The Betty Ford Center? 		Annabelle, how's your video rep...	Annabelle RUSHES past her.  Ben saunters off after his sister.	Jackie turns to Rachel, accusingly. 		What happened with Annabelle?  Has		nothing I said gotten through to you? 		Maybe you could back off just a little		bit -- 		What did you do? 		Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you		about...well...Luke said to ask you...	Jackie's edge sharpened by Rachel's unease. 		See, the place where I can connect		with Annabelle is my photography.		Because she loves video and all...	And...? 		She's been talking about this little		editing machine, it's only... 		...a ridiculously  expensive  and		 inappropriate  item, which her father		and I have already  told  her she is  far 		too young to own.  But  you  apparently		want to  buy  her forgiveness, with... 			(had enough)		 Forgiveness?   For  what , exactly?	Silence. 		How much time have you got?  Let's		start with this morning.   Why  did she		 run  from this room?	Long beat.  Then, Rachel looks dead on at Jackie. 		Luke was in the shower this morning and		Annabelle sort of walked in without		knocking. 		I'm sure that didn't upset her.		Everyone in our family takes showers. 		I was in there in him.	The air is thick with tension. 		Did you or Luke talk to her about it		afterwards? 		No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable		for her -- 		You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is		coping with the fact that her father is		never coming back to live with his		family.  She sees her father naked with		another woman for the first time.		And you think it's best for her if every-		one pretends it didn't happen?			(turning away)		This isn't going to work out. 		You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of		your imperious bullshit.  I never said I		was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time		life hits her in the face you want to		have a 12 hour talk every third Friday		or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life! 		Oh and I don't because I have a children?!		The problem is you're too self-involved		to ever be a mother. 		Maybe the problem is your  kids .  Maybe		they're spoiled, coddled  brats ! 		Get out! 			(holding up Post Its)		But it's not on the schedule! 		You got to hell!	Jackie turns away, storming out of the room. 		Ah Ah Ah!  You owe me a quarter -- 	Luke stands in an apron before Annabelle's Girl Scout Troop,	rolling out a large pie dough.  They imitate his every move. 		Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie		is the crust.  And the secret to a		great flaky pie crust comes from less		flour and more...what? 		Ice cold water. 			(adoringly)		That's my girl...	Rachel watches from a corner. 		Blueberry pie must be topped with vanilla		Haagan Daz and/or creme fraiche...now the		secret to a great creme fraiche is... 		Orange peel! 		...which also is the secret to... 		French toast! 		Now don't forget to teach your fathers		that.  Next week...apple brown betty!	He takes off his apron and walks toward Rachel as the girls file	out... 		She said no.	He doesn't even know what she's talking about. 		The editing machine.  I mean,		Annabelle would have  really  loved it.	She looks down. 		It would have been great for us,		so obviously, Jackie just...	Eyes down.  Choosing her words. 		She's really a difficult person...	Looks up. 		Best thing ever happened to you was		her throwing you out on your butt.	An afterthought... 		Not that I have a personal stake		in it.	He comes and kisses her. 		Get ready.  To get  really  mad. 		Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been		switched again. 		Not yet. 		Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear		Friday at two o'clo... 		We have the kids.  Next weekend.  		And it's  my  call.  I promised them		water-skiing, instead o... 			(quiet pain)		Our weekend.  At that sweet little		B & B.	He puts his arms around her. 		And the evil part is.  I am  so  stoked		about the water-skiing.  I can't wait.	He tastes her mouth.  And again.  A sweet, hot moment.  Her fingers	trace up his neck.  To his hair. 		No, this is good.  Celibacy is		healthy.  For a guy your age.  You'll		get used to it.	From the kiss that follows.  He won't have to. 	CLOSE ON an ANSWERING MACHINE.  IT CLICKS, WHIRLS, and... 		Hi, it's the trophy bimbo.  Annabelle's		teacher called, and her video report		is being moved up to 8:30 tomorrow.		Sorry to deprive your step aerobics		class of their role model.	Pause.  PULL BACK to see... 		Anyway.  I'm sorry I lost my temper		the other day.  And I'm sure you are,		too, so...	...BEN, looming over the hardware.  Fingers poised above the	buttons, and he... 		...no, apology necessa...	...strikes!  Playing all the keys at once.  Like chords on a baby	grand. 	CLOSE on a small TV MONITOR, the angelic face of 10-year-old TAMARA,	practicing for the Miss America Diplomatic Interview, circa 2009... 		Well, I  I  had a million dollars...		I would use it to...feed  all  the		precious hungry children of the world.		And bring about total world peace.	PULL BACK to see the class and teacher watching raptly.  Filmmaker	Annabelle in the seat of honor next to her proud father.  Rachel in	the back of the room, anxiously looking at the back door.  While on	screen...	...another face.  JARED, bad as he wanna be... 		A million big ones.  Oh.  I'd buy		about a thousand babes.  Not to do		anything bad, I mean.  Just to hang		with.	Near the monitor, Annabelle's eyes are also furtively cutting to	the classroom's back door.  On screen now...	...the handsomest 10-year-old since DiCaprio.  BRAD the Dreamboat.	Stares soulfully at the camera.  Murmurs... 		Well, first off, Annabelle.  I'd		give half of it.  To you.	The class OOOOOS, WHISTLES.  Annabelle flushes, but she clearly	likes it.  Brad grins a Redford grin her way.  And through the back	door BURSTS...	...a harried, disheveled JACKIE.  Still in workout clothes.  As on	screen... 		There you have it.  Now ask yourself		...what would YOU do?	The screen goes BLACK.  The class, teacher and especially Luke	ERUPT with APPLAUSE.  So does Jackie, who has locked eyes across	the room with her mortally-wounded abandoned daughter.  Then	Jackie's eyes CUT TO...	...Rachel, a deer in headlights.  Death by Army ants would be too	kind. 	Annabelle, Luke and Jackie GLARING at Rachel, who looks awkwardly at	her feet.  KIDS stream past, unaware of the gravity of the moment. 		Machines do not EAT message. 		Look, I... 		Of all the  cheap  excuses.  To break a		child's heart.	The jury is in.  There is no appeal.  Jackie takes her daughter's	hand. 		Don't worry, sweetie, there's still		the Harvest Pageant.  And you are		the  lead  vegetable...	Said with bottomless pride. 		And nothing.  And  no   one .  Can		keep me away.	One laser look at Luke. This bitch is  your  responsibility.  And	she leads her baby off. 	A parked VAN, packed with SNOWBOARDS and ski gear.  No people.  PAN	across the suburban lawn to...	...Luke, dejected, at Jackie's door.  Rachel nearby, still peers	into the window of an unlit, empty house.  A cellular phone RINGS.	Luke WHIPS it out, like the Governor's pardon hangs in the	balance...				JACKIE (O.S., from carphone)		You paged us? 			(distraught)		Where  are  you?	INTERCUT throughout...Jackie on her cellular, herding the kids	toward a CIRCUS TENT... 		Just outside the big top, we're		almo... 		You're WHERE? 		At the Big Apple Circus, it's the		only big top I know.  I  said  I'd		get 'em back tonight... 		Jackie,  we  were taking them water-		skiing for the  whole  weekend! 			(innocent)		...until the plan changed, when		Jessie's mom gave us these tickets.		What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?	Luke's eyes DART to an uncomprehended Rachel.  She's never seen	him this angry. 		Don't tell me.  Another machine ate		 another  message?  Boy, there's a  lot  		of that going around!  Put her on, huh?	A beat.  He hands the phone to Rachel. She brings it to her ear... 		Yeh? 		Think twice.  Before you  ever  pull		that again.	CLICK.  The line is dead.  And so is Rachel. 	A glum Annabelle and Ben sitting on a bench watching Rachel at her	photo shoot, George between them.	A beautiful WOMAN appears in the turret -- she lets down her hair --	a modern day RAPUNZEL -- her golden locks fall 17 feet -- now a BURST	of yellow -- as a hundred YELLOW CANARIES fly out from her mane!  A	beautiful MAN begins to CLIMB the hair.  FLASH!  The man DANGLING	in mid air surrounded by canaries.	Rachel works with intense concentration.  It's been hours.	Annabelle and Ben are completely bored. 			(to Cooper)		The timing was off -- I need this light. 			(to herself)		 Just  where I wanna be all Saturd... 			(to everyone)		Hold lunch! 		But we're hungry -- and I have to pick		up my costume for the pageant!  It		starts at seven! 		It's only one o'clock...Why don't you		get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done		soon -- really soon.	Annabelle and Ben.  Rolling their eyes.	LATER...Annabelle asleep on the bench.  Rachel stands over her, a	canary on her finger. 		Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's		Ben?  Is he in the bathroom? 		I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna		throw up. 	Annabelle stands with Rachel by a line of empty urinals. 		What if he's kidnapped? 		He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just		hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!	Panicked, she grabs Annabelle's hand. 		Don't touch me!  You bring bad luck!	Rachel.  Starting to believe it. 	Breathless, Annabelle and Rachel CLIMB the castle stairs when they	hear WHIMPERING -- Rachel follows the whimpering -- RUNNING -- 		Ben!  Ben we're here!  BEN!	In the corner of the tower we see GEORGE staring up at her.  But	Ben is NOWHERE to be found. 		He's gone forever and I'm gonna miss		the pageant.	Rachel once more.  Her life flashing before her eyes. 	Jackie BLASTS up in the Volvo, SLAMS to a stop in a non-spot, RACES	into... 	Jackie RUNS through the police station moving down corridors past	desks until she sees BEN sitting with TWO POLICEMEN on a bench.	She holds him to her chest, shaking. 		Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright? 		I knew where I was all the time. 	Ben sits between Jackie and Luke holding each of their hands.	Rachel sits on the other side of Luke; all waiting for the Harvest	Pageant to begin.  It's horribly tense. 			(sincerely)		Jackie?  I am so sorry about today I		really fucked up royalty.  When you		called Luke I was so goddamn relieved --	Luke elbows her with an ""We're in an Elementary School"" elbow. 		No I did -- I know I did -- I screwed 		up.  I feel like such an asshole...	Jackie lifts Ben onto her lap, holding him tightly.  She turns and	faces Rachel, claws bared. 		Shhhhhh!	The lights go down.  They sit pretending the other is not there.	On stage -- The class is dressed as the harvest PRODUCE.  Annabelle	is the CORN.  Each FOOD DISH steps forward and introduces itself.	Annabelle rehearing her line over and over. 		""Hello!  I am Maze.  But you can call		me Corn.  Hello!  I am...""	Inside her costume, her breathing is sharp.  She stands very	straight, very bold.  A brazen ear of corn.  She steps forward. 		""Hello!  I am...	Rachel POPS UP next to the stage with her huge PROFESSIONAL CAMERA	and giant flash.  Her camera FLASHES three times, quickly.  After	each flash, we see the picture for a split second, Annabelle.  A	TERRIFIED ear of corn.  A LOST ear of corn. 			(blinks, disoriented)		Um...I'm...I'm...Oh...	In the audience, Jackie is willing her daughter a recovery.  Sees	instead, a completely DEVASTATED ear of corn. 			(exploding in tears)		Oh forget it!	She runs offstage amidst laughter and applause.  Luke looks over at	Jackie but she and Ben have already left their seats. 	Jackie comforts Annabelle.  Ben watches closely, getting caught up	in his sister's sadness.  Luke and Rachel approach. 		I hate her.  I really hate her. 		There you are! 			(covering her face)		Don't take my picture!	She starts to cry.  Ben's lip quivers, his eyes well up. 		Annabelle doesn't really want to talk		to you right now. 		I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your		concentration.  I thought it would be		a nice moment to rememb... 		I don't ever want to remember this!	A TURKEY approaches. 		They're taking a picture of the		Produce, we need the Corn.  C'mon		Annabelle. 		See?  No one's laughing at you.  Your		friends want you to join them, Anna-		belle.  Corn is a very important part		of the Harvest Produce.  Now Ben, walk		your sister over to the Yams.	Ben takes Annabelle's hand.  When they are gone... 		Jackie, if I thought for one moment... 			(lighting into Luke)		You listen carefully because I am only		going to say this once.  That woman has		nothing more to do with my children. 		Our children. 		Do you realize what could have hap-		pened to your son today?  How lucky we		are the police found him before some		lunatic did?  He could have been... 		But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I		know it's terrifying.  I can imagine		how you felt when that call came -- But 		it happens. 		Not to me. 			(soft, reasonable)		Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all		make mistakes -- 		I'm not gonna wait around to see the		next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids		fall through the cracks of this		arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer. 		Jackie stop.  We promised we never go		there. 		We've broken a lot of promises,		haven't we Luke? 		Why are you taking this out on  him ? 		Rache, get out of th... 			(still to Jackie)		You haven't done  one  goddam thing to		make any of this easier... 		I am not  here  to make it easier for		you.  These are  my  children.  They		don't want to  be  with you. 		Well, maybe they would if they thought		it was okay, with y... 			(poking Luke's chest)		A court  order  is gonna say that  woman 		is  never   alone  with my children!  Ever 		 again !  Do you HEAR that?	All of New Jersey heard that.  On the silence that follows, she	stalks off.  The mother lion.  Doing what she has to do. 	Jackie and her children ride HORSES side by side through a perfect	Fall afternoon.  Our riders look about alertly, as if patrolling	enemy territory. 		Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy		sol... 		I don't  want  to be Lady Godiva 		anymore, no matter  how  much I like		chocolate.  I want to be a stud.	In distance, a gaggle of GROUNDSKEEPERS.  Jackie points these out	to Ben, without missing a beat... 		Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I		fear for the women and the property		values. 		I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the		Queen...	And she canters off, blood in her eye.  Alone now with his mom, Ben	has something serious on his mind. 		Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran		away. 			(doesn't turn)		No, that's your fault.  It's her fault		for not watching over my precious son,		as if it were her priority.  Which		means, the most important job. 			(thinks about this)		Rachel's job is she works. 		Ben, mommies work too.  They work very		hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom		than she did when she was working.  I		just don't get paid. 		Does Rachel make a lot of money? 		People like Rachel who only think about		themselves often do make a lot of money. 		I think she's pretty, Mommy. 		Yes...if you like big hair... 		Mommy? 		What honey? 		If you want me to hate her I will.	On Jackie.  Stunned.  Her lips part for an answer.  But she hasn't	got one. 	Luke pacing around on the path through Jackie's front lawn.  Jackie	exits the house, alone.  Stands on the porch.  And they stare at	each other. 		You know, you can come inside the		house.	He looks at the end of his rope.  She walks down to him. 			(quietly)		Did you see the lawyer?	Oh.  Well... 		Called him.  We set an ap... 			(almost a whisper)		Don't do this.	So vulnerable.  The air comes out of her.  We see how much she	still cares for this man. 		You're saying, don't make the kids		a football, don't put them through a		war.  But I'm doing this for  their 		well-being. 		Partly.  But partly, you're mad.	Staring.  At each other. 		You know the kids aren't really in		danger.  This is about Rachel, and		you're right, I'm disappointed in her		learning curve, and... 		 Slugs .  Have faster learning curves.		 Trees , even.	He takes a breath. 			(here it is)		I'm afraid she's going to walk. 		And I'm supposed to care.	He reaches out.  Takes her hands. 			(softly)		About me, yeh.  Like I care about you.	She looks in his eyes. 		Like you cared about me three		years ago?	He shrugs.  Looks saddened by that. 			(softly)		Hey.   You  kicked  me  out.	And just this once.  With all that's happened.  Jackie needs to	say... 		Maybe you should talk to your		daughter, about why.  She seems to		have missed that part.	Now he looks ashamed.  And sorry from his heart. 			(softly)		Forget I said that.	He has to tell her... 		This thing with Rache.  I need this.		I don't want to lose her.  And I will		 see  to it that the kids don't suffer.		Help me, huh?	Help me. 		I'd do it for you.	Yes, he would.  Despite everything, she knows that. 		One last chance, don't make me		regret it...	Her voice tried to be tough.  But the tension showed through. 		...or you will, too.	A last look.  She walks slowly.  Back toward the house. 	The last cars are pulling away.  No kids left, except the ones	shooting hoops.  Except.  On the low brick ledge by the flag	pole...	...Annabelle sits.  Alone.  Quietly freaking. 	Rachel and Cooper sit on a bare floor SURROUNDED by countless	PROOFS of FLYING CANARIES.  An assistant brings a cell phone to	Rachel, who holds it in place with her shoulder, as she frantically	sorts through the prints... 			(into phone)		...no, no, that is not possible.  You		must have the wrong little gir...	Stops. 			(into phone)		...because Annabelle's mother  never 		forgets, is  never  late, is  never 		imperfect.  So that's some  other  kid		sitting on the curb by the car pool li...	Listen.   All  the air comes out.  She looks around, sadly, at all	the work surrounding her. 		May I remind you that Duncan has the		 client  arriving at exac... 			(into phone)		Sure.  I was just doin' my nails. 	A cavernous sterile room.  A horrible METALLIC HAMMERING sound.	PAN to see that it comes from...	...a white cylindrical TUBE.  Bare feet protrude.  An MRI is in	progress.  The sound stops.  The body SLIDES from the tube, a woman	in a hospital gown.  She is Jackie.	She blinks at the light.  Her eyes are drawn, a million miles away.	A lot on her mind.  A TECHNICIAN enters the room... 		Your paper went off during the		procedure.  Do you want the number?	Jackie turns, suddenly focusing... 		Wait...what time is it? 	Annabelle sits glumly, refusing to eat some chips from the bag in	Rachel's hand.  Rachel's voice is low, soothing.  Dare we say,	maternal... 		Hey, sea salt and vinegar, I  know 		this is your fave.	Annabelle keeps her eyes down.  This is more than a sulk.  She	seems fairly unglued. 		C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom... 		Now could she just... forget  me!	Looks up.  Eyes desperate. 		I mean, that's something  you  would do!	Rachel stares back.  Eats a chip.  Decides... 			(softly)		Tell ya the truth?  I did.	The kid blinks.  A non-compute. 		Your mom had to...help a friend with		this...emergency?  And she called me.		And we switched days.  Then, I got		stuck on my shoot, and... 	Rachel WHIRLS to see JACKIE filling the doorway, Annabelle flying	to her mother's arms.  The women's eyes meet.  How much did she	hear? 	Jackie brushing out Annabelle's hair.  Jackie's eyes are distant.	Annabelle watching in the mirror. 		Are you worried about your friend?		With the emergency?	Jackie's eyes come back to focus.  Hmmn? 		Oh, I'm waiting on some news, that's		all.  Say.  Can I ask you why you		never asked me something you probably		asked Daddy anyway?	And she smiles.  Real carefree.  So Annabelle smiles back. 		You can try.	More brushing.  Gentler, slower strokes. 		Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the		shower.  What did you think that was		about? 		Sex.  Of course.	Oh. 		Well, not exactly s... 		Why does Rachel scream?	Does she mean what Jackie thinks she means? 		Scream. 		During sex.	Oh.  Again. 		How would you know sh... 		I live.  In the same country.	Her mother laughs.  Encouraged... 			(imitating)		Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God		Oh... 		...why do you think? 		Because it feels really incredibly		good.	Jackie moves around.  Leans to stare in her eyes. 		So why are you asking me? 		I like talking about it.  At least,		to you.	The look holds.  Almost a bittersweet smile plays on Jackie's lips.	She leans to kiss her daughter's head. 			(a murmur)		Same here, huh? 	TOTAL DARKNESS -- Slowly an IMAGE APPEARS -- Floating in a pool of	water.  It's a photo of a child's FEET.  Only the wrong shoe is on	the wrong foot.  Suddenly, KNOCKING... 		Hold on!  Don't let the light...	Jackie enters, leaving the door wide OPEN. 		...in. 		I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real		comfortable being here, but... 		I don't recall inviting you.	Silence. 		I overhead what you told Annabelle.		The lie.	Unreadable faces.  What are they feeling? 		I have a snoop. 		I didn't need you to take the blame		for me, I'm quite... 			(simply)		I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.	And Jackie.  Finds that interesting. 			(shrugs)		She already hates me.  You've seen to		that. 		You're not terribly good at taking		care of h... 		I need practice. 		Those are  my  children you're		practicing on.  They deserve  first- 		rate care.  Every minute.  Of every		night.  And every day.	More silence. 		So why did y... 		I did it for her.	Straight to her eyes. 		Poor kid has to believe in someone.		Even if it's you.	Nothing friendly about it.  But Jackie hasn't come seeking	friendship. 		I have an appointment this after-		noon.  I need someone to take them		to the park. 		What?  And have Federal agents jump		out of the bushes with court orders?		How many years do you get in this		state for giving second-rate care to		minors?	Hard looks.  All around. 		However many.  It's not enough. 		I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday,		I actually thought my boss was going		to fire me. 		Fine, forget it.	But neither of them wants her to.  A Mexican Standoff.  Until	Jackie empties her huge purse on the counter. 		Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new		shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's.		Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty		seat covers for public restrooms... 		Why not just bring the whole toilet? 		Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know		Dr. Seuss...? 		Not personally. 		Do you have a word limit you need to		hit every day or can I finish?	This silences Rachel.  Jackie hands her a Post It. 		Here's their schedule for this after-		noon.  I'll meet you at the park at		five.  All I ask is that they're alive		when I get there.	A beat. 			(dry)		Thank you.	And scoops up the parenting paraphernalia. 			(drier)		Thank you.	And walks out the door. 	Jackie stands outside a door.  Deciding.  She knocks and enters...	...Duncan's office.  He sits behind his desk, across from a client.	Both men looking up at this stranger. 		Mr. Samuels?  Forgive the intrusion,		I'm Jacqueline Harrison, and...	The sweetest smile she's got.  Which is pretty good. 		...well, I just wanted to thank you.		For your generosity. 			(a beat)		Gener... 		...my daughter had a terrible		emergency yesterday.  My husband and I		couldn't be reached, and...your Ms.		Kelly came to Annabelle's rescue.	Confides... 		I'd hate to think what might have		happened.	Shakes her hand. 		She told me that you were so suppor-		tive, even at great inconvenience to		your business, and...	An amazing smile. 		It's wonderful to see a successful		man.  With that sense of priorities. 			(longer beat)		Well...under the circumstances... 		If I can ever repay your kindness.  It		would be my great pleasure.	Backing out the door... 		...and your Ms. Kelly?  A remarkable		young woman.	The client is beaming. 			(clearing his throat)		We think so. 	CLOSE on Jackie, looking down.  She seems to be staring at	something in her lap... 			(quiet anger)		I don't even know what that means.		Spread.  That is  very  unclear.	...but there is nothing there.  Her lap is empty.  Except for her	unnaturally still hands.				FEMALE VOICE (O.S., gently)		I means we found some cells.  In your		lymph nodes.  In three of them.	The hands come together.  Slowly, deliberately.  Stating to anyone	who would watch that there is no panic here. 		But the other time.  You said you got		it all.  So you could be wrong again.		One time, you say one thing, then... 		The other time.  Was a year ago.	The air comes out of Jackie.  In a thin, slow, precise stream.	Everything, her very breath.  Under complete control. 		That was a tiny lump in the breast.		We radiated, we thought we had it		all. We were hopeful.  But there		were no guarantees.	Silence.  Jackie's eyes stay on her folded, still, hands. 		But we can beat it.	PULL BACK to see the small, neatly kept office.  DR. SWEIKERT is	50, slender, elegant, kind.  The doctor you want when you're dying.	Jackie looks up to her. 		People beat it, don't they?  All		the time. 			(straight)		Every day.  More and more.	Jackie swallows.  The confirmation of hope has allowed some of the	fear to show. 		So we'll...radiate some more? 		At first.  Then, after awhile, some		chemo.	A blow.  Jackie absorbs this. 		That's necessary, huh? 		Let's take our best shot.	Jackie nods.  Staring at the woman.  Then, to break the spell... 		I guess a no-hair day beats a		bad-hair day.	The doctor smiles.  Jackie looks at her watch... 		I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband		has asked me to dinner.  God knows		why, he was very mysteri... 		Have you still never told him?	A flash of the anger flickers. 		Why would his worry?  Or my children's		worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the		sit... 			(very soft)		Sooner than later.  You really need		to.	That brings a silence.  A shading of defiance to Jackie's features. 		You don't burden others needlessly.		That's how I was raised, Doctor.	Hold the look. 		Maybe at dinner tonight.  Think		about it. 	Jackie is getting dressed in front of the mirror, her eyes distant,	in spite of her attempts at control.  Annabelle is watching her	like a hawk.  We see Ben in the BACKGROUND -- sawing the BABYSITTER	ALISE in half. 		Why are you going to a French		restaurant?	Throughout, Annabelle is trying on Jackie's jewelry, making a pest	of herself.  Jackie fights against rising irritation. 		Because it's quiet.  And he wants to		talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in		half, it's bedtime... 		What are you gonna talk about? 			(applying mascara)		Probably you -- your brother -- school --		The solar system...The usual... 		Then why are you putting on mascara? 			(a beat)		I'm a little tired and it's just a		pick-me-up. 		But you only wore mascara when you and		Daddy went on romantic dates... 		Well Daddy and I are just friends		now, and that's no reason not to		wear mascara... 		Or blush.  You look pale. 	A Country French place on the West Side.  Classy, but inviting. 	Jackie and Luke sit across from each other in the lovely	restaurant.  Jackie looks beautiful in the warm candlelight. 		...Maybe you don't think three years		is enough for a person to change		but...things are different now Jackie.		I'm different.	Jackie feels her heart beginning to race.  They lock eyes for a	moment.  He unconsciously begins to eat off her plate.  He eats	her chicken, and in the dance they've done a thousand times -- she	reaches for his uneaten vegetables.  The WAITER approaches. 		Would you and your wife prefer		still or sparkling water?	He doesn't correct the waiter. 		Still, please. 			(when the waiter leaves)		Annabelle showed me the new dress.		She's amazing in it. 		Getting so beautiful...she looks more		like you every day.			(Luke downs Jackie's wine)		Jackie...I've really given this a lot		of thought.  A great deal of thought...	Their eyes lock for a moment.  Here it comes... 		I'm gonna marry Rachel.  I know you don't		think much of her but she's a special		person -- she really is.  And I love her.		This is a bridge we never wanted to cross		but it's not helping her or the kids if I		don't really commit to that.	Jackie stares at him stonefaced. 		I didn't think a phone call was		appropriate... 		Tell me exactly how you're different		from three years ago?  The music		sounds kind of the same from where		I'm sitting.	He shifts in his chair.  Wants this to sound as authentic as he	feels it... 		I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a		life that's built around commitm... 		Just not to me.	The waiter returns with a bottle of red wine.  It's horribly quiet	as he pours.  Waits, obtrusively. 		Thank you, it's fine... 		Would you like to taste it? 		Can we please have less service, here?	The waiter leaves, taking his attitude with him.  Luke sighs... 		It's going to be hard for the kids		when I tell them...I'd like you to		be there. 		To make it easier for them or you? 		It's a huge moment in their life -- 		You can't be an 'us' just when you		want to.  You can't play that card		when it's convenient. 		We... 		WE are over. 		WE'RE still their parents for the next		hundred years.	On this, Jackie looks down at her hands. 		You're still going to have to be		dealing with me -- with us.  We should		tell them together. 		No.  You think this is going to help		the kids then you do it.  You're on		your own. 	Jackie sits next to Luke on the couch -- looking lovingly towards the	children, who sit across from them.  Annabelle is taping this... 		The great thing about life is that		things keep changing. 		Remember when Mommy and Daddy got		divorced? 		And we all went through that together?	ON Ben.  OH MY GOD.  He knew it!	ON ANNABELLE -- Behind the video camera -- Where's this headed? 		Well things are going to change		again...	Ben LEAPS up from the couch and FLIES into Jackie's arms. 		I knew it!  I knew it!  I knew you		guys were getting back together!	Jackie looks at Luke.  Annabelle ZOOMS IN on their faces. 		No they're not. 		Annabelle put down that camera.	She ZOOMS in on his face. 		Put down that  goddamn  camera! 		You owe me a quarter. 		Look she's upset -- 		No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should		I care?  I mean nobody asked me when		you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if		I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even		asked me if I like her.  If you guys		don't care about our family staying		together, why sh... 		Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did. 		No you didn't!  All you guys did was		name call!  I heard you!  You didn't		even try and use your words!	Ben runs out of the room.  Luke follows him. 	Ben pulls his cape over his head and hides in a bundle in the	corner. 		I'm disappearing.  I'm almost		invisible... 			(holding him)		I'll find you wherever you go...my		magic boy...I'm still your daddy...		nothing will ever change that. 	Jackie moves to Annabelle who won't put down the camera. 		Annabelle...Rachel's not taking my place		as your mother -- it's just Daddy's chance		to be happy again.  Isn't that what we		all want for each other?	No answers.  Jackie looks at this daughter she loves so much.  Pats	the seat beside her... 		Come.  Sit.	Something in the softening of the tone changes the atmosphere in	the room.  More real.  More like equals. 		Life is full of hard things.  And we		can't always have what we want, you		know that.	Don't you?  Annabelle nods, cautiously. 		But we do have a choice.  To make it		better.  Instead of worse. 		Like how? 		Like seeing the good side of Rachel.		So she'll see the good side of us.	Annabelle's stare is hard and questioning.  She didn't expect this. 		Because I'm looking ahead.  And you		know what I see...?	Annabelle doesn't.  But she sure is listening. 		Time will come.  When we all need to		be there.  For each other.	Strokes her baby's hair. 		That happens.  To families. 			(straight back)		I'll be there for you.	Her mother's eyes cloud with feeling.  A murmured... 		I'm counting on it. 	Barely any light in the empty kitchen.  PAN to see Ben, alone, in	his cape.  Carefully, he sets a cup of saucer atop a cloth napkin	that lies across the butcher block table.	He GRASPS the corners of the napkin.  He looks scared.  We get	what's about to happen.  As he...	...YANKS the napkin, as FAST as he can, the cup and saucer, RATTLE	and...	...stay put.	Ben.  Is astounded.	And then he looks up.  To a cabinet filled.  With glassware and	china. 	...Rachel's HAND as a beautiful ANTIQUE RING is slipped on her	finger.  She is asleep.  Then, she...	...stirs, wakes.  Stares at her hand in shock and delight. 		Oh my God.  Are you serious? 			(tenderly)		I think so...What do you think? 		I think so too...	They hold each other for a long time. 		It's forever you know. 			(trying to read him)		Okay...Is that the good thing or the		bad thing? 		Because I can't hurt anyone like 		this ever again.	She grins. 		How did  you  hurt someone?   She  threw		 you  out, remember?	He does.  She hugs him tight. 		Everything's gonna work out.  The		kids and I...we're going to love		each other. 		Rache, it may take time. 		What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll		still be ambulatory.  I think.	She's counting on her fingers.  He kisses her. 		It's inevitable.  Look, I was		defensive, I was insecure.  I was		afraid to love first.	Her incredible smile.  Filling even Luke with confidence. 		But I'm not anymore.	A sudden horrific CRASHING sound.  The breakage of the breakable.	Their look holds. 		I'll get this.	A quick kiss.  And she's gone.	HOLD on Luke's light smile.  Maybe this  will  all work out. 	Ben is cuddled up in his coverlet.  Almost as if he's hiding.  She	picks up some stray underpants.  Actually, three of them. 		Are you  real  mad? 		How could I be?  We learned some		magic...	She goes to his bed.  Sits down. 		I made all the pieces disappear.	Oh.  She leans toward him... 		And you learned...	She kisses his forehead.  Very sweetly. 		...to make that  trick  disappear,		huh?	He nods.  Big time.  She stands, smiles... 			(softly)		A night.  Of learning.	They share the smile.  And Rachel leaves, into the darkened hall.	Down it now, only to...	...stop.  Open a door, so quietly.  Silently enter... 	...the room of a sleeping child.  Rachel moves soundlessly to	Annabelle's side.  Stares down.  Listens to the soft breathing.	She straightens the covers slightly, in a maternal way.  Then, on	impulse, reaches down...	...tenderly smooths back a strand of hair.  One last look.  And	she...	...leaves frame.  HOLD on Annabelle, as we hear the knob turn.  The	door close.  Alone, now...	Annabelle opens her eyes.  She is thinking. 	Rachel dropping off Annabelle at Jackie's door.  They must be late,	because Rachel is looking anxiously at her watch.  Not even	noticing that Annabelle has pulled out a tube of LIP GLOSS, turning	the shaft to reveal a glittering golden-colored gloss.  Then... 		Uh.  Put that away, hon, your mom w...	The door OPENS.  Jackie is dressed for riding. 			(sincere)		Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping		Ben off at Kevin's. 		It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The		horse'll be there.	Rachel blinks.  Is she on the right planet? 		Mom, look what Rache got me!	Uh-oh.  The kid holds it up. 		It's not to wear around, or any-		thing, I'm  way  too young.  It's		just for play. 		See, I... 			(taking it)		That is so pretty.  You usually only		see that color in people's teeth.	Annabelle has entered the house, to see on a table by the door a	huge, brightly-wrapped PACKAGE. 		Wow.  Who's that for? 			(quietly)		Well.  It's for you.	The kid WHIRLS around.  Really? 		Just because.  Just because I love		you.  Go ahead...	Annabelle starts to unwrap the present with Christmas-morning-care.	Jackie looks at the glitter gloss... 		I'm sorry, I just... 		Hey.  At least it's not an editing		machine. 		No way.  I told her two, three years,		maybe, for such an expens...	And stops.  Because the paper has come off.  A giant deluxe model	beginner's VIDEO EDITOR.  Annabelle is STUNNED silent.  So's Rachel. 			(tears in her eyes)		Oh, Mommy...	And JUMPS into Jackie's arms, CRUSHING her with the hug mothers	live for. 		I hope it's the right kind. 		Are you  kidding ?  It is  so  much better		than the one Rachel showed me!	Jackie strokes her baby's head. 		Well, I thought.  You know, why wait?	The child turns to Rachel, frozen in the doorwary. 		I  told  you I was big enough!  Is my		mom the greatest, or what?	Rachel swallows. 		The greatest.	HOLD on the look.  The women share. 	Jackie and Annabelle riding.  The kid is still on Cloud Nine.	Jackie's eyes are on her. 		...I mean, she knows all the music,		and pop stars, and clothes and stuff.		She's like still a kid, herself. 		Like a big sister. 		She knows every neat junk food place.	Looks to see if her mom is okay hearing... 		Actually.  She's kind of cool,		when you get to know her. 		I bet.	Annabelle studies her mom's profile. 		And don't tell her I told you. 		Secret's safe with me. 	Rachel sits cross-legged on the floor of the walk-in closet.  Next	to her, a glass and a botle of Stolie, getting toward the bottom.	An ashtray filled with butts, and...	...a card board box.  Dragged out of somewhere.  Photo albums, loose	snapshots.  Vintage stuff.  From her face, this is  not  a carefree	romp down Memory Lane.  She takes another hit on the Stolie.  More	than slightly intoxicated, weaving, squinting at...	...the next photo.  Luke, young, straddling a Kawasaki.  Jackie,	just as young, holding him from behind.  She wears a halter and	shorts, and looks simply terrific.	Rachel looks drunk and jealous.  With an overlay of self-pity.	Brings the photo closer.  Squints harder. 		What the fuck is that?	Her worst fears confirmed... 		...a  tattoo ? 	The lights are coming on in The City.  Jackie sits staring out the	window, as an IV drips into her arm.  She is alone, and down.  And	fighting the fear of what may come to pass.  Her pager goes OFF.	Jesus.  She pulls a cell phone from her purse.  Works it with one	hand.  Brings up...the smile.  Showtime. 			(softly)		Hey, good-lookin', I was just		thinking about calling y...	INTERCUT throughout:  Ben on the phone in Rachel's and Luke's	kitchen.  He is alone.  Staring through the glass window of the	oven... 		Rache says I have to eat  lamb .  I		told her  you're  making me  spaghetti ! 		Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you		up tomorrow, and we do  big  spaghetti. 		And many meatballs.	A nurse enters, and Jackie shoots her with a wave of her fingers. 		You'll be up to your armpits in		meatballs, I'm flying them in		from Sweden. 		Is that like Luigi's?	She loves this kid so much. 		Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country.		Like Canada.  Only smaller. 		Where are you, anyway?	And the feeling comes straight to her eyes.  She can't fight it. 		I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And		meatballs.  And you know what? 		Yes. 		Of course, you do.  Being magic.		Then you know I've got a flu bug,		and I turn green and barf profusely		when I even think about food.  So,		all the more meatballs for you.  But		you know what. 		I did.  Do I have to eat lamb?		Daddy didn't cook it, she did. 		Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then		give me a secret report, okay?  Pay		particular attention to whether it's		chewy and if it tastes more like		chocolate or soup.	He laughs.  And she can hear that.  And her eyes fill.  And she	murmurs... 		Hey, that's a world-class laugh		you got there.  Can I all you		sometime?  If I fell blue.	A silence.  And for a heartbeat, the fear.  Did he hear it in my	voice?  But no... 		Sure.  You got my number.	And now she's crying.  But she can't.  She can't.  Gains control	for a whispered... 		That I do.  Always will. 		Mom...?	She sniffles... 		I'm fine, ba... 		Tomorrow?  Can I have one		butterscotch pudding for dessert?	See her relief.  Secret still safe. 		Nope.	He's crestfallen. 		We can only have two. 	Jackie is pushing her cart.  Ben sits in it, pulling things off the	shelves.  On automatic she's putting them back. 		Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and		I call you mommy; and Rachel's real		name's Rachel...Then when I see her do		I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's		Ben, how come you don't call me son? 			(lost in thought)		Thursday's fine...	Frustrated, Ben CLIMBS OUT of the cart and trails behind Jackie.	He reaches for an apple off the BOTTOM of a huge display of Red	Delicious, and the whole thing comes TUMBLING DOWN.  Shaken, she	looks around for Ben.  He's gone. 	Jackie with a Store Manager and a Policeman stand at the front of	the store near the Bakery.  Jackie is totally distraught. 		I looked away for one second...		Just one second...he's...he's... 		How would you describe him? 		He's my son!  He looks like his		father!  His name is Ben -- he		answers to Harry -- 		Is he wearing a red shirt?	The manager POINTS to the frozen food bin.  There, lying on his	back atop dwindling stores of Breyer's ice cream...is Ben.  Hands	and beaming face PRESSED to the underside of the glass.  Jackie	does the only reasonable thing... 	...and FLINGS OPEN Snow White's glass coffin. 		ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD  SUFFOCATE   		Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.	Enough of a non-sequitur to make everybody blink, before Jackie	YANKS him, roughly and tenderly, from the bin.  She CRUSHES him in	a violent, desperate hug... 		You found me cause I'm your		 priority , huh?	She kisses him fiercely.  At the edge of tears.  Whispers... 		You got that right. 	Luke coaching the girls team.  Annabelle one of many who surround	him for that final word of wisdom... 		Alright my Little Warriors, remain		calm; trust that the ball will find		you; remember they're your opponent		not your enemies -- Not kick MAJOR		butt!	In the bleachers, Jackie sits alone with Rachel.  They are having a	coaching session of their own.  Rachel points down to the field,	where...	...Annabelle pushes her hair over her eyes. 		She's gonna trip over her own feet,		if she doesn't get her hair out of		her eyes.	Jackie casts a sidelong glance at Rachel.  Decides to tell her... 		Pushing her hair over her eyes.		Means she's avoiding a confrontation.	Rachel looks over.  Really?  Jackie decides to share more.  Reading	Rachel's reaction to... 		If she's twirling it, she's playing		something out in her mind.  If she's		stopped combing it, she might be		depressed...	As Rachel listens she's unconsciously twisting her hair. 		What about obsessively picking her		split ends? 		Anxiety. 		Last week when she chopped her		Barbie's bangs all to hell -- 		She was angry at herself. 		Jackie? 		Yes? 		When I twisted hair like this it		means I'm intimidated by you...	Jackie gives her the trace of a smile. 		I'll keep it in mind, and use it		against you.	She looks back down at the game.  Rachel watching her profile.	Finally... 		You feeling all right? 			(doesn't turn)		Not great.  Plus, I've got things on		my mind.  You know.	Things.  Rachel doesn't know.  Blurts... 		Are you...seeing someone?	Jackie snorts a laugh.  In spite of herself. 		Yeh, that  does  tend to make me sick		to my stomach.  Actually, I'm, uh...	Thinking.  Deciding if this is the time to say... 		...thinking of going back to Random		House.  On a part-time basis. 		Wowie.  How wonderful!	But Jackie still hasn't turned.  Eyes glued to Annabelle, racing	around with determination. 		Well, I could do most of it from		home.  But, while I'm working it out		with the head editor, I'd need to...	Sighs.  Boy, this is tough.  Tries for matter-of-fact... 		...make some trips into the city.		Sometimes, overnight. 		Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.	Jackie nods.  Appreciates that.  But she  still  hasn't turned to	look Rachel in the eye. 		Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki... 		Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may		not happen.  Our secret, okay?	A little strange.  Particularly the hardness of Jackie's eyes.	Rachel watching her.  Something's up. 			(softly)		Sure, if you like.	Jackie looks away now.  To the playground just beyond the	bleachers.  Kids rise swings, clamber over a jungle gym.  But her	eyes are routinely, automatically, zeroing in on one single kid...	...who is climbing his way UP a tall SLIDE.  Crouched over as he	inches up the shiny metal surface, using the side rails.  Rachel	follows Jackie's eyes, just as...	...Ben reaches the top and STANDS UP, hands OVER his head, Jackie's	breath catching, Ben totters once and...	...FALLS fast, hitting the grass with a thump we can hear, lying	crumpled, motionless, as our two women...	...SPRING up as one, SCRAMBLING down the bleachers, RUNNING toward	the playground, Jackie initially in the lead, but Rachel out-	sprints her, CLOSING  on the child, as he rolls over grasping his	leg, and reaching him first...	...some instinct makes her hold back, let Jackie RUSH past her, to	kneel at Ben's side.  She lifts her baby in her arms.  His pants	are torn, his leg is bleeding.  His own concern... 		I can still go to Tucker's party,		right? 	A full house of walk-ins with assorted needs, none of which appear	to require George Clooney on an urgent basis.  Across the room, an	irritated Jackie finishes the last of the paperwork at the nurses	station.  Exchanges a less-than-pleasantry with the less-than-	helpful duty nurse, and...	...heads off through the crowd, DOWN a hallway, TURNS a corner, to	see...	LUKE stands by a doorway.  Smiling, as he gazes into a hospital	room.  Jackie comes to his side, looks in...	Ben doesn't see them.  His back is turned, as he talks to Rachel,	who sits on the side of his bed, feeding him the pudding she got	from a vending machine. 		...for Christmas, okay?  Every		magician needs a white dove, a		 real  one, they  do ! 		Well, that's a long way off, sweetie.		We'll talk to Mom and Dad... 		Dad!  You can talk him into anything!	Unseen by the two, Luke grins.  Then, Ben snuggles into Rachel's	arms and kisses her.  Jackie stares. 			(singing softly)		'In the still...still of the		ni-ight...I held you... held you		so ti-ight'...take it, man... 			(singing softly)		Doo-wop-doo-doo,  doo -wop-doo-doo...	Jackie stands there.  Her eyes are difficult to read.  But she sure	is watching. 			(softly)		Nice, huh?	She steps back.  Looks him in the eye. 		It is.  It's about time.	He give her a goofy give-me-a-break FACE.  She twists the corner	of a smile. 		She's a charmer, you'll see.  In		fifty years, the kids'll love her		ten percent as much as they love you. 		Stop.  You're making me insecure.	Now they're smiling at each other.  In the old way.  A nice moment	for them. 		You changed your hair.	And we notice.  It does look different. 		It's temporary. 			(grins)		It's good.  You're not pulling a		mid-life crisis on us, are you?	Her look holds.  An odd extra beat. 		Not the term I'd use.	He glances back through the doorway... 		You want us to take him tonight?		Give you some private time with		Annab.... 		Never stand between that kid and		a meatball. 		Yet another spaghetti night. 		Yeh, better I should forcefeed		him burnt lamb and...couscous,		was it she made him?  Boy, kids		go wild for that.	She pats him on the shoulder... 		I'll drop him at Tucker's party		Saturday, if one of you guys can		pick him up.  I have to go into		the City.	And breezes by him into the room.  Ben wheels to see her... 		You know what happens to spaghetti		when it waits around for you too		long?	He  really  thinks.  Actually... 		No. 		Pray.  We never find out. 	A door with balloons OPENS -- STACY, the birthday boy's mom, stands	there -- children running behind her in party hats, all with their	conservatively dressed SUBURBAN MOMS.  Rachel's attire a sharp	contrast. 		Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben. 		Does Jackie know this? 		No.  I'm doing it behind her back. 		In seven years Jackie's never		missed one of Tucker's parties.		Where is she? 		Something came up.  C'mon Ben!		I've got a shoot at three... 		Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present		yet -- it won't be too much longer.	Rachel eyes the MOUND OF PRESENTS yet to be opened.  DISSOLVE TO...	FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER...Rachel, in a pointed party hat, sits	schmushed on the couch in between all the other MOTHERS.  A black	jeans stranger in a strange peach land.  She eyes that mound of	presents.  Not even a dent.  She pulls out her cell phone, moves	towards the hallway. 		Hey Cooper...pull a number 64 steel		blue gel on the back light...yeah		I'm on my way but...	A piece of CAKE FLIES through the air and LANDS on Rachel. 		Now Ben, let Tucker play with his		Batcave...	Ben won't let go of Tucker's presents.  Tucker tries to take it.	Ben is adamant.  Rachel reaches for him, tousling his hair. 		Hey Benjy boy -- chill.			(he shimmies away from her)		He's there already?  No I don't want to		talk to him -- Duncan?  How are you...	The mothers are all too aware of Rachel on the phone.  Two kids	shoot water guns -- Rachel gets drenched.  Ben pulls at the toys... 		I want it! 		Ben I know you're angry and confused		but it's Tucker's birthday party.	Ben and Tucker fight for it -- the mothers all LOOK TO RACHEL. 		Ben --			(into phone)		Duncan I'm aware of that - Goddamn it		Ben!  Let go of it.  NOW!	He stares at her.  It looks like he's gonna let go --	On the mothers -- impressed, not to mention surprised.  When Ben	suddenly HURLS the toy onto the floor SHATTERING IT!  A horrible	SILENCE falls over the room.  Broken only by the sound of Duncan	SCREAMING from inside the phone. 		Rachel...This is a big bloody account --		If you don't show up in five minutes...	Rachel takes Ben and leads him into another room. 		Ben I'm sorry.  It's been a hard day.		Now would you do us both a favor and		take this phone and...	She SLAMS the phone SHUT.  Hands it to Ben. 		...make it disappear.	Okay.  He SHOVES it down the front of his pants.  The peach moms	are taken aback.  Rachel nods, you got it.  Delighted, Ben turns,	scampers off, as...	...his pants start RINGING.  He stops dead.  Looks down at them.	Still RINGING.  He turns around and waddles delicately back to	Rachel, as if he's carrying nitro in his shorts.  She holds out her	hand... 		Breaks out the geiger counter, the		man is  radio -active!	He pulls the ringing phone from his pants.  She grasps it without	hesitation, while peach moms wince in disgust.  SNAPS it open... 		Get  over  it, Dunc...			(stops)		...whoa, whoa, Annab...	Listens.  While  everybody  watches. 		Could it be, maybe... anywhere  else?		Like...another  galaxy  would be more		convenient.	Listening, listening.  Everybody  really  watching.  Even Ben.	Rachel oblivious... 			(gently)		Okay, don't cry.  Flunking science		is not happening.  On my watch. 	All the kids are running around crazily in a hypersugared frenzy.	Peach moms drink diet sodas and chat.  Rachel making a call by the	phony little carp pond... 		...just that her daughter left a		science book somewhere at her house,		and I need t...	INTERCUT throughout:  a starchy, powerful, crisply intellectual	SENIOR EDITOR, in her early fifties and her Jil Sander outfit.  The	East Side below her window. 		I'm sorry, Ms. Harrison is  not  here.		I think I  mentioned  that.  Twice.	Rachel nodding. 		Well, she's been meeting with the		head editor for the last few w... 		Miss, I  am  Senior Editor.  Ms.		Harrison left Random House eleven		 years  ago.  We have not had the pleas-		ure of a visit from her in that time.	Rachel blinks. 		Actually, she's going back to		work with your company on a part-		time basis. 		Excuse me.  If Jackie Harrison were		coming back to the editorial staff,		I would be frankly delighted.  And I.		Would be the first.  To know.	Silence.  In the midst of hysterical children. 		Thank you for your time. 		Don't mention it.	And Rachel's line.  Is dead. 	Rachel alone at Jackie's front door.  Staring at the key in her	hand.  One last chance to back out. 			(mutters)		What the hell.	OPENS the door.  Enters the empty home.  Walks slowly, self-	consciously, down the hallway.  Kitchen, kids' rooms... 		Now, if I were a science book,		where would I...	And stops.  At the doorway of the master bedroom. 		Who am I kidding.	And goes straight to Jackie's desk.  Starts rummaging through the	incredibly neat stack of papers... 		Great, I'm leaving prints.	The open appointment book.  Today's date.  Just says, NEW YORK.	Nothing more.  Opens a drawer.  Stapler, clips, neatly-stacked	stationery.  Opens the bottom drawer, and...	...stops.  She pulls out...AIRLINE TICKETS.  Opens the folder.	Continental Airlines.  Newark to San Francisco.  And tucked	inside...	...a fax, neatly folded.  Rachel opens it.  The letterhead says,	NORTH POINT PRESS, 134 Sutter Street, San Francisco, California.	CHARLENE DRUMMOND, Editor. 			(reads)		Jackie.  Can't wait to see you here.		I know you're anxious.  But it's going		to work out wonderfully, I promise.		Til then.  Charlie.	HOLD on Rachel.  Trying to put this together. 	Jackie takes a kettle from the stove.  Pours the water into a tea	cup.  Then, fills a second cup.  Drops a tea bag into each.	Carries both cups to...	...the kitchen table.  Where Rachel is waiting.  She looks more	than tense.  Actually, scared.  Jackie taking this in, as she sets	down the tea. 		Okay, what is this?  If you want to		dump Luke on me, no sale.  You're		stuck with him.	And before she can sit... 		I know your secret.	Jackie FREEZES.  To stone.  No one says anything.  Two hearts	beating at red-line. 		I don't know wh... 		I was looking for Annabelle's book,		and I found your tickets.  And the		note.  From your new boss.	My what?  Jackie leans forward.  Her hands resting on the back of	the chair she never sat in. 		My boss. 		You're not working at Random House,		I talked to them. 		You WHAT? 		You're taking the kids.  And moving		to San Francisco.	And Jackie has to laugh.  Cold.  Bitter. 		Look, you've never liked me... 		Don't flatter yourself. 		And I know checking into your life		was inexcusable... 		Nobody likes a snoop. 		But I came here to...	All the air comes out of this young woman.  so vulnerable, so real. 		...to beg you.  Not to do it.	And at this.  A look of intense interest crosses Jackie's face.	Really? 		I'd have thought this was the		answer to your prayers.  Lose the		witch, and her two brats, in one		swoop.  Problems solved.	Rachel is clearly distraught. This is no act. 		You can't take Luke's children		away from him.	Jackie thinking.  Reading this girl's face. 		Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every		day.  Luke gets the kids every other		summer, every other holiday, it's not		ideal, but people make it work, and... 			(blurts)		We can't live like that.	And Jackie straightens.  Cocks her head. 		Did I hear the word... 		Luke.  Can't live like that.	Ah. 		Then let him talks to me.  We don't		need you to solve our prob... 			(quietly)		...it's my problem, too.	And Rachel's eyes.  Fill with tears.  She hates that.  Jackie won't	take her off the hook.  Stands waiting, until... 		I got used to...thinking of them.		As...my kids too. 		Really.  By what right?  Six months		of part-time screw-ups?	Rachel lifts her chin.  Defiant and tender at once. 		No right at all.  I just love them.	Now it's Jackie's eyes.  That begin to fill.  And she hates that	even more. 			(pleading)		There's  so  many publishing houses		in New York.  Surely, you could find		a good one?	Jackie takes a step back.  Shakes her head.  Goddammit, life is	full of surprises.  She walks around in a little circle.  Turns	back... 		Sure, I could.  If I was looking		for one.	Rachel's turn to be surprised.  Confused. 		You're a moron, kid.  You guessed		the wrong secret.	An odd, almost defiant look.  Jackie reaches up to her own head,	and...	...slowly, holding eye contact all the way, she slips the wig from	her head.  Her scalp covered by the partial regrowth that chemo-	therapy has left her.  You can hear Rachel's GASP clear to Kansas. 			(calmly)		Charlie Drummond used to be a		colleague at Random House.  I'm		crashing at her place, while I take		some new protein injections my		oncologist recommended.  I can only		get them in San Francisco.	Rachel's lips part.  But no sound comes. 		Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer,		your hair falls out, but you  do  get		to smoke dope. 			(please)		You're not dying.	The kid so painfully sincere. 		No such luck.  I'm beating the shit		out of this.  Pardon my French.	Rachel can't find her breath.  She is clearly the worse off of the	two, in this moment.  Then she starts to nod... 		You bet you are. 		How the hell would you know? 		I don't, but... 		How would you know  anything ?	That was sharp.  Rachel startles slightly. 		I exercise, I eat the healthiest		foods, you live on pork rinds and		Ho-Ho's, and  I've  got cancer!	That leaves a silence. 		And cigarettes.  I smoke, too. 		You are  marrying  the  greatest  guy		who walks this  earth .  Who I have		 loved  from my  heart  for twelve years !	Listening? 		And you walk in.  You smile that		smile.  You move that boy.  And		he's yours for free.	She sags back against the counter. 		And you.  Love my kids.  How fucking		touching.	Comes forward.  Stalks her. 		They came out of my  body ! 		See, I know that. 		I have given them more love  and		more  care  every fifteen  minutes  of		their lives, than you could manage		in the next fifty  years !	Leans over the table.  Rachel looks scared to death. 		Okay, I'm undeserving. 		Ironic, huh?	And staring in Rachel's eyes, Jackie's fierceness fades. 		Ironic, that I'm gonna need you.	All the air comes out.  Her heart as naked as her skull. 		To be a little less.  Undeserving.	The look holds.  And holds. 			(quietly)		Drink your tea while I go vomit.	And turns, goes to the door.  Turns back. 		You love my kids, that's a start.			(nods)		We'll work on it.	And gone.  Hear her footsteps.  Climbing stairs.  Rachel lifts her	cup.  Looks at it. 			(calling out)		This is very good tea!	Then tastes it.  Makes a face. 	A graceful stone building with arched windows.  Gas lanterns on the	exterior wall and burning dimly inside.  Stone gargoyles smile down	on those who enter the heavy, bright red wooden door. 	Drinks hour.  Upscale crowd.  Dim lights, clink of glasses, the hum	of private conversations side-by-side.  Civilized as hell.  And at	the deuce by the window...	...the man's head is down.  We can't see Luke's expression, as he	stares at his clenched hands.  We don't need to. 		I thought a phone call was		inappropriate.	No one smiles at the irony.  Not much to smile about. 		I could have taken you to that		restaurant, but it would have		been a waste of money.	He loos up.  She studies the pain. 			(softly)		I know.  I wouldn't know what to		say.  If it were you. 		We're going to win this. 			(straight back)		Walk in the park.  And thanks for		the 'we'.	Tears fill his eyes.  None in hers. 		You're not alone in this.  You're		not alone.  Jesus, you're not alone,		okay?	Jackie swallows.  Tries a smile that doesn't get halfway there.	Looks down. 		What happens next? 		I live or I die.	Looks straight in his eyes.  We don't need the bullshit.  Not us. 		Tell the kids together?	She thinks.  A barely perceptible nod. 		Want Rache someplace else?	On that one.  She has to smile. 		My compliments.  On your learning		curve. 	Jackie carrying two steaming MUGS from her stove.  These have	marshmallows floating in them.  She sets them down in front of her	children.  Ben starts plucking the marshmallows out of Annabelle's	mug.  Annabelle doesn't care, too busy video taping...	...her father.  Who sits with this tender, compassionate, and	therefore rather ominous smile.  Doesn't take a smart kid like his	daughter to guess... 		So what's up?  Who's marrying who		 this  time? 		Mommy's marrying Rache!	He's happy.  Jackie reaches and shuts OFF Annabelle's camera.  And	the directness in her gaze keeps the child from complaining. 			(simply)		Mommy's sick, guys. 		You have the WORST flu since... 		I have cancer.  Do you know what		that is?	He doesn't.  Someone else does. 			( real  quiet)		It's what Grammy Lil died from.	Ben's eyes WHIP OVER to his sister.  He sees the cold fear in her	face.  BACK to Mom.  She seems fine, calm, smiling even. 		Grammy had a different kind.		There are lots of kinds.  Hers		was very bad. 		Is your bad? 		Shut up.  She's going to die.	But the anger in her eyes isn't for Ben.  She is glaring.  At her	mom. 		Actually, I'm getting better already.	Straight.  As if to an equal, an adult. 		I had a lot of treatments, and		they weren't any fun, but the		tests show the cancer got smaller. 		A lot smaller.	Annabelle cuts him an angry look.  He's on her shit list, too. 		So you're okay. 		I'm still sick, but I'm better. 		You  lied  to us when you never told  us!	Ben hadn't thought of that.  Nods now, yeh. 		That's right.  And you're mad.	Annabelle just glares with all the hatred she can turn her fear	into. 		I know how scared  I  get when		 you're  sick.  So I waited to tell		you.  Until it was getting smaller.		I thought that was best, maybe I		was wr... 		You lied.  If you lied  then ,		maybe you're lying  now .  I can		 never  belive you  again ! 		Annabelle, never say 'nev...'	But Jackie's raised her hand.  Jump back, Jack.  The eye contact	with her daughter never breaks. 		We make mistakes.  And we forgive		each other.  Because we love each		other, very m... 		Where's Rache?  It's  Thursday ,		we get to be with  Rache ! 			(the diplomat)		I'd rather be with Mommy. 		She's  dying  and  Rache  is your		mother now!	She jumps up from the table.  HISSES at her brother... 		You are so STUPID!	And she RUNS, halfway to the door... 	She turns, STARTLED at the anger in that. 		You do NOT run out on your moth... 		YOU'RE WORSE THAN  SHE  IS!  WHY		DON'T YOU JUST DIE,  TOO ?	And BOLTS from the room.  In the silence she's left behind. 		Annabelle's worse than everybody. 	Rachel and Luke cuddled in bed, watching a video in the darkness.	At least, she is.  Just now, he's watching her. 		Well, I think you should tell him		you changed your mi... 			(softly)		It's no biggie.	She's still watching.  It's a French-language comedy.  She can feel	his eyes on her.  Never turns... 		It's just an assignment. 		It's Anna Sui, you should be		doing it. 		Are you hungry?  You could make		us something?	She's still never looked at him.  He can see she's getting irritat-	ed.  He says nothing. 		It's two solid months, around the		clock, Jackie needs some cover-		age, you're in a trial, what are		we talking about?  There'll be		other assignments.	He kisses her hair and flinches slightly.  Tries to pretend it's	because she's concentrating on the movie. 		They're my kids. 		Great, wallow in guilt, you  sure 		you're not Jewish?	A long beat.  He snuggles closer.  They watch together. 		She's not gonna die. 		I know that. 	Jackie and Ben cuddled in bed, watching a video in the darkened	room.  It is not a French Comedy.  They are, however, eating	popcorn.	The door opens.  Annabelle stands motionless, composed.  Her face	looks like she's been crying.  She clears her throat... 		I'm sorry you're sick.	From across the room.  Jackie stares at her. 		I can't hear you. 	Jackie cups her hand to her ear.  Shakes her head, can't hear a	thing.  Waves, come on over.  And slowly...	...Annabelle does.  Crawls up into the bed, on the opposite side	from Ben.  Into her mother's arms.  Jackie kisses her head, strong.	Big smile. 		I said... 		...I'm not deaf, y'know.	They grin at each other.  Like equals.  Jackie picks up the remote,	cuts OFF the sound.  And when Ben turns to her... 			(singing)		In the still...still of the		ni-ight...I held you...held		you so ti-ight... 		That's Rache's song! 		Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that		song before Rachel was even born.	Wow?  Really?  You bet.  Annabelle chuckles. 		You think she's the Queen of Cool?	Jackie shakes her head.  Pulls down the covers, pulls up her	t-shirt... 		Does she have a tattoo?	The butterfly.  Just below her navel.  Ben has seen this before, of	course.  Touches it, with his small hand. 		He wouldn't know.   I  saw her		in the shower! 		And...?	Ben looks to his sister.  For the verdict.  Annabelle shakes her	head.  Nope. 		She is only the  Princess  of Cool.		 Mommy  is the Queen! 		She is but an arriviste.	A new word, apparently. 		A newcomer.  She's still got a		thing or two to learn.	Annabelle nods.  You betcha. 			(resumes singing)		I held you...held you so ti-ight...			(to Annabelle)		You sing lead, you've got the voice...	She bumps head gently with Ben. 		The stud and I will doo-wop.	And as they doo-wop the back-up... 			(sings)		For I love...lo-ove you soooo...		promise I'll never...Let you go... 			(sing)		In the still of the ni-ight. 	Parents streaming slowly in for a PTA night.  They are chatty,	tired, preoccupied.  And 95% female. 	Folding chairs set in rows.  Parents taking their seats with coffee	and cookies.  Up front, a table where a panel of speakers are	beginning to gather.  A faded banner says PTA -- TENAFLY DAY SCHOOL.	Jackie is nibbling at a single cookie, when...	...a figure slips into the seat beside her.  Rachel is juggling a	coffee and maybe nine cookies.  Drops one.  Picks it up.  Dusts it	off.  Jackie is repelled, but has to smile. 		Small world. 		Luke's depo ran late.  I promised		I'd take notes.	To prove it, she balances the cookies on her thighs, and produces a	notebook.  Looks around, and in a conspiratorial near-whisper... 		So I have to tell you something		in confidence... 		You're a cross-dresser. 		That.  And.  Annabelle is over		her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat'		Kovitsky.	Does a Groucho eyebrow move. 		She hasn't mentioned this. 		She was afraid you'd make a big		deal out of it.	Jackie is hurt.  Covers... 		Moi? 		Toi.  They've been 'going out'		for two weeks.	Rachel breathless and happy.  Jackie attentive. 		As you may know, 'going out' in the		six grade doesn't mean shit.  They		don't actually  go  to a movie or		anywhere, they don't even eat lunch		together, it's just a declaration to		the world that they're... 		...going out, yeh.  I had kids of		my own, once. 		Anyway.  He walks up to her on		lunch yard today.  And tells her...		publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'	Jackie's mouth drops. 		Oh, my God. 		Right.  Which is the whole  point  of		this 'going out' thing, so one of them		can dump the other one, and they can		imitate the whole passionate adult		soap opera tragedy, without ever		having to actually date. 		She's devastated. 		Doesn't  begin  to describe it.		I mean, you've got cancer,  this 		is serious.	Rachel GRIPS Jackie's arm. 		She spent an  hour  in the girls' bath-		room,  crying  with eight of her  closest 		friends, who are sending the message		to every boy in the grade that Brad		Kovitsky is yesterday's  toast .	Devours an entire cookie in one gulp. 		So here's the point.  I pick her up		from soccer, she tells me the whole		mess, and asks me what to do.	How about that? 		And you said...? 		Beats me.  Ask your mom.	Oh. 		So she's gonna.  Tomorrow.	Leans closer.  Whispers... 		Don't fuck this up. 	Jackie and Annabelle are sitting at the kitchen counter with maybe	twenty hardboiled eggs.  They are cracking the shells gently, and	carefully peeling them. 		Well, did you really think you'd		meet someone at  eleven  that you'd		spend the rest of your  life  with?	Annabelle keeps her eyes on her eggs.  A craftswoman. 		No, but I thought till Thursday.	Oh. 		What's Thursd... 		A debate.  Man's inhumanity to		woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con.		Ms. Flannery is twisted. 		I could help with the debate. 			(glum)		Great. 			(thinking it over)		Actually.  I could only help him. 		Every time I'm on the lunch		yard, and he's with twelve of		his retarded  dorkface  little		adoring out-crowd  henchmen ... 		You don't like his friends. 		...they all yell 'There goes the		Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess',		or some  really  clever cut like that.		Like it hurts my feelings.	They keep peeling eggs. 		You wouldn't kiss him, huh? 		Not with my mouth open. 			(softly)		Good girl.	Annabelle's eyes well up.  She covers by concentrating all the	harder. 		And what do you do wh... 		I call him a fartface or a pervert,		or something equally lame. 		You have to ignore him.	And on this.  Annabelle looks up. 		He's not even there.  You don't		see him, you don't hear him, you're		just too much of a woman to bother		with little boys. 		This is a joke, right?	Jackie shakes her head.  Nope. 		All he wants is the attention.		When he can't get to you, he'll try		harder for a little while.  Then,		he'll give up.  It'll be no fun.	The kid blinks. 		You think Rache would do that?	Takes Mom back a bit.  Enough for her daughter to notice. 		It's just she's younger.  Maybe		she remembers how to do this.	Jackie shrugs.  Maybe.  Annabelle studies her. 		This'll work, huh? 		Oh, yeh.	Annabelle takes heart from her mom's confidence.  Nods, with her	trademark determination. 		How many devilled eggs can		you eat? 		Maybe twenty.	Jackie surveys the table. 		We can always go to the store,		if w...	A sudden BANGING on the screen door.  They turn to see...	...a breathless six-year-old TUCKER through the screen.  The	birthday boy at the recent party. 		Mrs. Harrison...? 		Tucker, is something wr... 		How tall is your tree?  The really,		really,  really , REALLY big... 			(shrugs)		Why?	Uh. 		How bad would it hurt?  If you		fell off the top? 	AERIAL VIEW of Jackie, Annabelle, Tucker and assorted neighborhood	looky-loo kids from SEVENTY FEET in the air.  Everyone looks like	TINY DOTS running around the lawn.  We realize that we are almost	at the TOP of a giant EVERGREEN TREE.	We see a patch of red.  And now a blue stripe.  The wind reveals	more -- It's BEN CLIMBING to the very top of the tree.  The calling	of his name becoming more and more faint in the distance -- His leg	MISSES a branch -- causing a cluster of PINE CONES to FALL in front	of Jackie -- she looks up screaming -- 	Jackie's POV -- Ben crouched at the top of the evergreen -- as the	wind sways the tree perilously back and forth. 		Don't move!	SMASH CUT TO LATER, as...	An enormous CRANE moves through the sky.  Jackie holds tightly onto	JESSICA, a diminutive five-foot-tall Firewoman, as they soar skyward	towards Ben.  A slightly condescending tone to... 		That's quite a grip you have there		Ma'am.  Do we have an issue with		heights?	Patronized the wrong gal.  In a crisis. 			(looking her up and			 down)		I don't care if you're a dwarf,		so long as you do your job.  		Ma'am, my arm's going numb, maybe		you could loosen your grip just a		little. 		That's absolutely out of the question. 	The crane STOPS.  Ben has climbed to the top branches of the trees;	they SWAY from side to side like a METRONOME. 		Hello Ben.  Your mother says you're		real good at disappearing --	Ben tries to climb a little higher -- Branches SNAP. 		Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now		stop climbing!			(He keeps climbing)		Ben listen to me... 		No!  I have to get there. 		Where Ben? 		Before you. 		Ben where do you have to get to? 		Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made		a mistake.  He should take Grammy		Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.	Jackie's heart breaks, unable to speak. 		Ben.  God doesn't like visitors. 		How do you know? 		Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson.		She does this twenty times a day. 		Oh.	Jessica begins to crawl out to him on the limb. 		Oh yeh.  It's in our official manual. 		That's right, Ben.  That's why Firemen		have giant ladders and climb up		and down poles.  They're like...		messengers... carrier pigeons...		between heaven and earth. 		That's good cause we need to hurry.		My mom doesn't have very much time		left. 		Then you know what we should do?		We should go to the Fire Station		together and ring the firebell to		get God's attention. 		Cause it's an emergency.	Ben opens his arms, teeters, and Jessica HAS him.  She reaches him	out, and...	...HANDS him to Jackie, alone in the cherry-picker.  Jackie GRASPS	Ben, pulling him FIERCELY to her arms in a death grip.	From down below, the kids CHEER.  The worst is over.	HOLD on Jackie, clutching her baby for dear life.  Knowing it isn't. 	Jackie stands in the doorway watching her son -- her baby boy --	sleeping.  She looks drawn, but even if her body would let her	sleep she couldn't. 			(a whisper)		God...I will do anything...I will		go through any amount of pain you		give me.  If you'll just let me		see them grow up.	A slow ragged breath. 		Is that asking so damn much?	She leaves the room soundlessly.  Ben stirs. 	Annabelle sleeps soundly in the glow of a night light.  Jackie	appears, leaning down to rouse her gently. 		Annabelle...wake up honey... 			(sleepy)		Mom?  What's wrong? 		Nothing sweetheart.	Jackie sits on the edge of the bed, stroking Annabelle's head. 		I got Ginny Weintraub to come stay		with Ben.	Annabelle's puzzled look.  Why would you do that? 		How'd you like to go someplace		special with me?  Right now. 	The light of the full moon illuminates the night and we see Jackie	and Annabelle sitting on a horse.  Annabelle in front, Jackie with	a strong hold on her.  Both have their nightgowns tucked into their	jeans, coats over them. 		Hold tight, sweetheart.	She KICKS the horse forward and they HEAD OFF toward the rolling	hills in the distance.  Jackie and Annabelle ride faster and faster	along the trail.  Jackie has one arm firmly around Annabelle's	waist and controls the horse with the other.  Jackie closes her	eyes for a moment, allowing the wind to wash over her.  The smells	and sounds of the night seem to free her, give her strength.	Annabelle relaxes against her mother and giggles with delight.	Jackie soon joins her, and the sounds of their laughter break the	silence of the night.	They come to a stop at the crest of a small hill and we now see the	tears on Jackie's face.  Annabelle can't see, and stares out at the	moonlit valley before them. 		I'm never, never going to forget this.	Annabelle snuggles back.  Happy. 		Never say never.	Jackie kisses the top of her baby's head. 		You're old enough to learn the		loophole.   You  can say 'never,		never'.  If you mean it enough.		To say it twice.	Annabelle yawns.  So content in her mother's arms. 		I'll remember.  Always, always.	So Jackie grips a little tighter.  Breathes a single word, just	loud enough to hear... 		Promise. 	Rachel and Luke heading up the path to Jackie's door.  It is early	winter.  Stark trees, a light snow on the ground.  Rachel pulls her	coat tighter around her. 	Ben rumbling down the hall to the door.  Stands in front of it, as	the bell RINGS again.  	So he does.  Gives her a sweet hug. 		Hey.  Remember me?	He enters behind her.  SCOOPS his body in the air. 			(John Wayne)		Listen up.  That's a pretty big love		you're givin' my best girl, pard. 			(Clint)		Listen sideways.   I  love her and		 you  love her.  Now what are we		gonna  do  about it?	They follow Rachel down the hall... 			(Mister Rogers)		We'll share.  Like good neighbors.	They enter the living room.  Annabelle sits sullenly in front of	the TV.  Her overnight duffle and book bag and coat piled beside	her. 		Hey, gorgeous, where's Big Mama?	No answer.  Annabelle worried about something. 		She still packing for her trip? 		I  killed  my math quiz, A-minus.	They slap FIVE.  Go through the ritual of a three-step black guy	handshake. 		And...other things?  At school?	Annabelle cuts a look in Luke and Ben's direction.  Please  not  in	front of the menfolk. 		We'll talk.  I'll go check		on Mom.	Annabelle frowns at Mom's name.  Rachel strokes her.  Heads down	the hall...	Knocks at the open door to Jackie's bedroom, where Jackie is	calmly, meticulously, laying out things beside her large open	suitcase.  She waves Rachel in, and keeps working. 			(checking out the			 stuff)		It's gonna be cool, huh?	Bulky sweaters.  Wool things. 		I can never figure weather.  Last		trip, I made all the wrong choices.	Rachel and we have a better angle now.  Jackie looks awful.  Drawn,	weak, masking pain with obvious courage. 		Bad day?	Rachel sits on the edge of the bed.  Jackie turns away, goes to her	open chest of drawers. 		Can't complain.	Even her voice is carefully under control.  Awkward, Rachel looks	around the room.  A stack of photo albums, scrapbooks, open.  Works	in progress. 		Can I look at the pictures? 		It's a mess, right now.  That's		my project when I get back.	So quiet, we can hear a clock TICKING nearby.  Rachel's gaze	returns to the bulky sweaters.  Holds there. 		See, I'm not going to Houston,		after all.	Like you obviously figured out. 		There's this clinic in Montreal.		We've studied their process, we		like their success rate...	Two women nodding, in a calm, matter-of-fact way.  As if discussing	recipes. 		They combine some compounds that		have been getting results in France,		with vitamin injections.  Seems to		activate the chemo...	Silence. 		So.  Hopeful. 		It's promising, this one.  We're		upbeat.	Rachel swallows.  She's out of words. 		I really look like shit. 		You look sick.  But you look...		together.  Mentally tough. 		Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for		serene, they say some actually get		there.	A shrug.  The first bitterness to seep through. 		Prob'ly low percentage on mothers.	She sits, unceremoniously, right on the floor.  Pantomimes a smoke.	Rachel goes into her bag. 		You try to center on the big issues,		y'know.  What it's all about.  What		this whole trip has meant.  But then,		the  really  big issues keep swamping y... 		Brad Kovitsky.	Tosses Jackie a pack.  Matches next.        	You don't have any pot, I s'pose?	Rachel's eyebrows head north. 		The primo stuff is great for pain. 		I think my 'primo shit' got left		in my 'bellbottoms.'	Jackie lighting up.  Deep soulful drag. 		So.  She ignores this little Kovitsky		punk, takes the high moral ground...	Reading Rachel's face.  Who is already wincing. 			(yeh)		He's relentless.  A  major  asshole. 			(nodding)		And you said... 		What else?  Keep on keepin' on.	Oh.  Rachel tries to hide her disappointment. 		She has to stick with it.  Have		the patience, the guts, to ignore		the pain.  You disagree?	Half a beat.  Rachel shakes her head, nope. 			(softly)		Hey.  You oughta know. 	Luke sits with Ben, building a gigantic magic castle from a million	Leggos.  I's architecturally interesting.  Through the window	behind them, a cold winter rain. 		God, sorry I'm so late...	She is entering, peeling off her jacket.  Tired as hell. 		Duncan is doing his Himmler		imitation on this gig.  I got		yelled at for quitting at  eight .	Under Luke's patient exterior, the stress is showing.  As Ben	watches, he replaces a key piece of the turret... 		Yeh, well, I'll be up all night		on this brief.  And then...	He shoots her a  really  sorry look... 		I've got a morning plane to Boston		for the depo.  Back Sunday night.	Wow.  They lock eyes in the bond of 'what are we gonna do?' 		No problem. 		I made that paella you liked.		It's on the stove.	She kisses Ben's head, Luke's mouth, that one lingering a little.	Then, down the hall to...	...the kitchen.  Annabelle sits with her homework stacked,	untouched.  Staring out the dark window.  Clearly, this is worse	than death. 		Lemme guess.  A bad hair day.	Annabelle TURNS like a hunted animal... 		She told me to  keep  ignoring him!		So I  did  it!	Not a good result, huh? 		You know what that creep and his		frogfaced footmen are calling me		 now ?  In front of the whole  world ?		Frosty, the Snow Bitch!! 		That's so weak. 		Here's  weak ...Mom said she was		gonna talk to the  teacher  and		Brad's  parents !!  Can you  believe 		the  humiliation ??? 			Honey, she won't d... 		I told her if she pulled  that ,		I'd  kill  myself, and  she  could		go to  my  funeral for a change!	For a change.  That's where this is coming from.  Rachel reaches	her arms around her... 			(murmurs)		Hey.  Hey.  I've personally never		gone to a funeral.  And I'm not		starting anytime soon.	The phone begins to RING... 			(a whisper)		Specially not in this family.	Keep RINGING.  Rachel checks her watch.  Shit. 		Nine o'clock.  That could be your		mom from Montreal.  Now you need t...	But Annabelle BREAKS LOOSE from Rachel's arms and BOLTS out of the	room.  Rachel watching in despair.  Lifts the phone on the sixth	ring... 			(bright and soft)		Hi.  How's the vitamins up there?		Having big fun?	INTERCUT throughout:  Jackie in a hospital gown.  At the window of	her room, rain pouring down on Montreal. 		Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle		there? 		Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben		first, it's past his bedti... 		How's she doing with Brad?	A beat. 		Can I say one thing?  I mean, the		 last  thing I want to do is inter-		fere on the Brad thing, b... 		Thanks, but it's under control.	A shorter beat. 		Yah?  Well, even the best mom in		the world, the smartest, the wisest,		whatever.  Needs to know when to		find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A  is  not		and  will  n... 			(tired, short)		It's  covered , okay?  I appreciate		your concern.  Can I talk to her?	And real quiet... 		I'll get Ben. 	Annabelle lies on her bed in darkness.  Clutching her pillow.	Lights streams in as Rachel enters.  Sits on the bed, next to this	furious child.  Puts the cordless phone by the pillow. 		Annabelle, I know you miss your		mother.  So why don't you say hello. 		Why don't you say hello? 		Annabelle pick up the phone. 		Annabelle pick up the phone. 		That doesn't bother me. 		That doesn't bother me. 		You think this is funny? 		You think this is funny? 		No.  I think it's ugly. 		You're just a  stepmother .  So stop		 bossing , cos nobody's  listening ! 			(even, in control)		June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your		Dad.  And then I  will  be your stepmom.		And right now, I'm not looking forward		to th... 		Suits me  fine !	Rachel cooks her head to one side, like she's seen Jackie do. 		Stepmother.  You think that means		you can step on me?  Over me?  That		you're one step ahead of me?  Well,		you're not.	Strong voice.  No smile at all. 		You know when girls grow into women?		When they  have  to.  And this is your		moment, kid.  Ready or not.	Picks up the phone. 			(low)		Your mama is in a hospital, far away.		She needs you, right now.  She needs		you to be big.  To put the kid aside,		and help her get well.  Now.  Fucking.		Do it!	CLICKS the phone ON.  Hands it to her. 			(tears on her face)		Hi, Mom.  How are you feeling?	As Rachel leaves, silently, we...	INTERCUT throughout:  Jackie at her clinic window.  Cellular at her	ear. 		Darling, I've been thinking about		our little Brad problem?  And I		think it's time we move to Plan B... 		You cannot  believe  what he said,		it was the worst  instant  of my		total life on  Earth !! 		I know.  I know how rough life can be.		And how unfair.  So here's what we do.		Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk		 straight   up  to that little jerk... 		And bring my knees up,  real  hard, yeh? 		No, that never solves anything.  You		talk like the big girl you are.  About		what you feel.  And how he's hurt you.		You know?  You tell the truth.	Nodding to herself.  Knows this is right. 		You use your words. 	An actual SUBWAY CAR filled with PAIRS of animals, cats, rabbits,	dogs, two horses peeking out a window, peacocks.  Noah's Subway, so	to speak.	Duncan and his client watch as Cooper assists Rachel, who SHOOTS	the menagerie from low ANGLES.  At last, she lowers her camera.	Check her watch.  Shoots Cooper a knowing look.  And HANDS HIM the	camera.  WAVES to her subjects... 		I love you guys.  You're animals!	And starts WALKING OFF down the tunnel.  Duncan looks at his	watch, then JUMPS up, TEARS after Rachel, GRABBING her arm,	SPINNING her around, he faces...	...someone ready for this. 		It's 1:45, I told you there's no		one to pick up Annab... 		But you're not  done !	She licks her lips.  Stands her ground. 		I've got it.  It's in the can,		Cooper can wrap th... 		We don't KNOW if you've got it, we		haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back		and FINISH!	Her glare says do NOT fuck with me.  The mother lion look we've	seen on Jackie. 		Which part of no don't you		understand? 		Look, I will  send  a P.A. to pick		up the children.  There are  agencies 		that supply sitters, nannies... 		They're losing one mother.  They		can't lose two.	The bottom line.  He looks as freaked as she is determined. 		You're making a  career  decision		here, I would  strongly  sugg... 		Duncan.  I've got an  even   better 		idea...	She leans forward.  In his face.  So she barely has to murmur. 		I.  Quit.	A beat. 		You can't  do  that, I won't  let  you! 		No, no, no, this is a job that's		hard to  keep ,  not  a job that's		hard to  lose , can't be both. 		Rachel,  don't  do this, you will		 never  forgive yourself!	She thinks that over.  For half a second. 		Actually.  I just did.	And without further fond farewell...	She is gone. 	The last cars are pulling away.  Some kids are still playing	sports.  And sitting on the ledge by the flag pole...	...two children.  The little boy is reading his Garfield book for	the three hundredth time.  His big sister is simply crying, openly,	for a disinterested world to see.  A car SCREECHES up.  The driver	BLASTS out the door, RUNS to us...	Then crouches slowly.  At Annabelle's feet. 		Oh, baby, I'm so sor... 		IT'S NOT YOUR  FAULT !!	Rachel is dying inside.  Reaches to brush at Annabelle's tears, but	the child SMACKS her head away. 		Ben, go sit in my car right now,		and I will bribe you big time.	Excited, he runs off. 		I  did  what she said.  I  used  my		words, I  told  him what I  felt ,		and they... 		...laughed, yeh.  They laughed		real hard.	Annabelle nodding BIG, gulping back tears. 		That's because men can be scum,		your precious father excepted,		may you live to find one like him,		it is damn hard.	And wraps her arms around the girl... 			(looking around)		Now is that little prick still here,		because if he is, I'm gonna rip his		fucking  heart  out! 		No,  his  mother's always on time.	Great. 		And Mom says anger never, never		 solves  anything.  It makes every-		thing  worse . 		That's because your mother is a		fine person, finer than I will		ever be.  Now, just this once...	Just this once. 		If I tell you what to do.  Can we		cut a deal?	Annabelle stops crying.  This is what she has prayed for. 		Tomorrow is Friday, your mom comes		home.  You tell her you did what she		said.  It didn't work yet.  But you're		gonna talk to Brad again on Monday.	Leans close... 		And you don't  tell her.  What		you're going to say. 		Not use my words, please! 			(smile)		No, baby.  You're gonna use		 my  words.	The sun dawns.  On a child's face.  Rachel brushes the tears away.	They won't need them anymore. 		Okay, let's start with looks.  I		know he's handsome, but the best-		looking people are so vain, there's		always something they're insecure		about.	Annabelle shakes her head.  Nothing. 		Does he have zitz?  We can call		him Pizza Face.	Nope.  None. 		Help me here... 		Uh.  He thinks his nose is too		big.  But it's not. 		Great.  Big ears, too? 		No.  But they stand out, a little.		Like this.	Shows how. 		Done.  He's a dead man.	Rachel stands up.  Walks in circle, thinking.  Comes back.	Strikes a pose. 		Monday lunch, you walk up with		 attitude , you hear me?	Finger STABS out... 			(as Annabelle)		Hey,  Ear  Boy!			(does the ears)		Listen up,  Rhino  Face, because I'm		saying this  one  time!  So your		pathetic, no-life, ass-kissing little		 groupies  here, better take  notes !	Annabelle is swooning with joy. 			(as Annabelle)		 I  dumped  you , limp dick, when I		got a peek at your deformed  unit ,		which is sadly  microscopic !	Annabelle laughing, applauding. 			(as Annabelle)		As for your pitiful knowledge of		 sex ?  I'm not wasting  my  time with		some  loser  who doesn't even know		what  snowballing  is!	Annabelle raises her hand. 		Uh.  What is it? 		Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting,		and not remotely sexy thing, that		they described in a movie I'd never		let you go to.  But it's real.  Does		he have an older brother? 		In high school. 		He'll be impressed.  The clincher is,		you  walk  away, then  whip  around...	Like this. 		The guy  I  see is in the eighth grade		at  Prep  School, and he laughs his  ass 		off every time we talk about you. 		But Rache... 		A  suitable  boy, will be at  this 		flagpole,  on  Monday, with a  very 		expensive bike, and he will be a		stone FOX if I have to call an		 escort  service!	The kid.  Is breathless. 		Now let's go stuff you full of		junk food.	Wraps an arm around her. 		I've had the worst day.  Till now. 	Arriving PASSENGERS are filling through the gate.  Last, is a female	FLIGHT ATTENDANT, WHEELING a gray-faced Jackie in a collapsible	wheelchair.  The woman leans to her... 		We'll get your bags, and the taxis		are just...	Jackie GRIPS the wheel, STOPPING them.  Stares, frozen, as across	the way...three faces stare back. 			(sheepish)		Surprise?	And Jackie LEAPS out of the wheelchair, RUNS across the distance,	runs to SCOOP her babies in her arms... 		It's a miracle!  I can walk!	Annabelle laughs.  Ben covers Jackie with kisses.  Rachel watches.	From the crowd. 	Rachel carrying the suitcase, Jackie has each kid by the hand, as	they troop through the house to arrive at...	...Jackie's bedroom.  Where Jackie freezes.  Her mouth OPEN.  For	Rachel has...	...HUNG striking black and white PHOTOS of the children all OVER	the room.  One is of Ben's FEET, left shoe on right foot and vice-	versa.  Another glimpses Annabelle's beautiful FACE hidden in her	hair.  Ben sitting in a cupboard.  Annabelle a bold ear of corn.	Ben sitting on the bottom limb of the huge evergreen.  Annabelle	kissing her horse's muzzle.	Jackie just stands.  Trying not to cry. 		Okay.  These are good. 		I helped.	She know he did.  Looks across the room at Rachel.  No more words. 		Let's go to the park!	Jackie sighs.  Smiles down at him. 		I've got a lot of medicine in me,		sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for		driving or running ar... 		Rache can do that part.	Jackie absorbs that.  And all it portends. 			(softly)		Hon, maybe your mom would like t... 		...go to the park.  In the worst way.	Silence. 			(grins)		Well, with Rachel driving.  That's		how we'll go. 	LONG ANGLE...five swings in use.  In four, the kids are pushed by	moms or nannies.  In the fifth, Ben is pushed by Annabelle.  Guess	who's going the highest.  PULL BACK to...	...two women on a bench.  Under a starkly bare tree.  Jackie is	drinking in the air, the cold, the day.  Rachel watching that. 		Serene.  You're getting the hang		of it.	Jackie doesn't answer for a beat.  Almost as if she hasn't heard. 		Serene means you accept.	Shakes her head. 		Part of me hasn't quit yet.  And		the other part is still pretty		outraged.			(calmly)		When it's not terrified.	Watching the world of moms and kids.  Who are not terrified. 		I'm thinking.  Do I know you well		enough to really chew you out? 		No.	Jackie turns to her.  Diamond laser glare... 		Have you lost your  mind ?!  You fought		 years  for that job!  And you  quit ??	Oh.  That. 		It's just not the right time t... 		Do what you've worked your whole		life to do? 		It was just a job, there'll be plenty		of others. 		You mean, after I'm dead?	Do you? 		Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm		sure as hell not gonna.  I just		mean, I'm juggling a lot right n... 		Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into		your house.  You've got that room		downstairs with the treadmill Luke		never uses anyway.  Don't lose your		confidence.  Don't lose your edge. 		It's the same choice you made. 		Yes.  I made the choice that was		right for me.  And I don't regret		it.  But even for me, there were		days when I felt so lost, so invis-		ible.  And then I'd hate myself for		the kids not being enough.	Reading Rachel's face. 			(softer)		I know you, huh?  The car pools,		he measles, the PTA.  It's not		gonna be enough for you in the long		run.  You have to think long term. 		I just want to spend time with		them when I'm not rushing or on		the phone or tired or... 		That's motherhood.  That's the		job, with or without a career.		I'm telling you the biggest gift		you can give them is your happiness.		They  need  you to be happy.	Can you hear me? 		Cause if you're not, the easiest		person to  blame is the guy sleeping		next to you.  And you'll push him		away, and then hate him even more		when he goes, until finally you have		no choice but to leave.  And that		can't happen.	Rachel's turn to wonder.  She starts to say something, thinks	better of it.  Asks instead... 		That's the bottom line, isn't it?		I can't make a mistake.  Because		it'll screw your kids.	Glances over. 		My advice to you?  Don't die. 		Feeling the pressure?	Rachel's eyes move across Jackie's face.  Then, out to Ben, on the	distant swings. 		Last time  I  pushed him?  He said,		'Higher, Rache.  It makes my penis		sting.'	Thin smile.  Now it's Jackie watching Rachel's profile. 		I'm gonna buy him that white dove		for Christmas.  If I don't, you'll		get him a fucking eagle!	Jackie keeps watching her.  And in a quiet voice... 		Ben was born in two hours, went		right to my breast and camped		there for three days.  Always with		this...mischievous look...	Watches Rachel nodding, absorbing. 		Somehow, his blanket always looked		like a cape, even the nurse said		that.  He  loves  to hear that story,		over and over.  How he was born a		magician. 			(softly, never turning)		And her...? 		Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't		sure about entering this world.	Watches the feeling well in Rachel's eyes. 		The doctor wanted to go in and get		her, but I knew she'd come in her		own time.	Rachel nods.  It fits. 		That's who she is.  Don't let		anybody rush her.	Silence.  A murmur... 		I'll keep that in mind.	Rachel settles back.  Her eyes now locked away somewhere private. 			(quietly)		What?	Rache smiles.  That Jackie sensed something. 		It's not about the kids.	Looks over.  Decides whether to ask... 		That thing you said before.  Pushing		the guy sleeping next to you away.		Because of what you gave up for		motherhood... 		Is that what he told you? 		He won't discuss it.  Just calls it		history.	A trace of edge to Jackie's smile.  But no real anger. 		Well, he got that part right.	Looking.  Looking. 		So what's the part he got wrong?	An urgency in that. 		I got all day. 	Luke and his bulky briefcase, coming down the stone steps two at a	time, until...	...he sees her.  In her winter coat.  Smoking as if it could keep	her warm.  And despite her tension, he grins, heads over. 		What a great surpri... 		Hold your applause.  We're not		having fun, here.	And from her face.  She means every word. 			(concerned)		Is Jack okay?	Great.  Just what she wants to hear. 		Oh yeh, she was cracking me up.		Dishing details of her sordid		little divorce.	Ah.  A beat.  To assess the damage. 		And you freaked.  A little.	Hey... 		Just like to make sure.  That your		past.  And my future.  Are real		different. 			(quietly)		Well, they will be. 			(hard and low)		Imagine my relief.  So what's for		dinner?	He sighs.  Jesus. 		Why in the world would she t... 		You took a fishing trip with the boys.		Liked it so much, you took another. 		I needed some time away. 		...while she watched the kids.  Then,		you booked this flat in Paris for your		family's summer.  But she said... 			(weary)		'...the kids have camp.  Their friends		are here.  Over there, I'll just be		shopping in a language I don't even		know.  My life, and the kids' lives,		aren't here to service your mid-life		crisis.'  Did it go like that?	It did.  People are passing them.  They do not notice. 		She called it a fight.   The  fight. 		What do you call it?  You told her		you had doubts.	He looks around.  People are moving on.  Toward their drinks, their	dinners, their lives. 		Can we go sit somewhere? 		Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.	And takes out her cigarettes.  Her fingers fumble slightly.  It	isn't the cold. 		I told her I loved her. 		By way of saying you were unhappy. 		Restless. 		Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing		for me, Jack.  Our life feels too		comfortable, too safe, too predict-		able.  It's a partnership, it's		juggling schedules.  When I think of		playing that out, every day, for the		rest of my life...'	Dead at his eyes.  And he nods.  Once. 			(softly)		'...I don't know if I can make it.'		That's what I said.  But I didn't		leave. 		No, she threw you out.  What a		difficult woman.	Pulls out her box of matches. 		So now  I  get to wait...	A single match... 		For the first sign.  The first		 fishing  trip...	STRIKES it.  Shields it from the wind. 		What do you figure, Luke?  When		am  I  too old to be exciting?  When		your daughter brings home her college		roommate?	Lights her cigarette.  As he watches. 			(softly)		That's a pretty ugly thing you		just said. 		No, here's ugly.  'I love  you , babe.		It's just our  life  together I'm not		so sure about...'	Big draw.  Never wavering from his eyes. 		'But keep dancing, and if you're		lucky, I might just never leave,		who knows?' 		That's not us. 		Because you've changed so much.	He puts his hands on her, gently.  But she flinches.  So the hands	come away. 		You want me to show you the future.		Well, I can't darlin'.	I can't.  She searches the lovelight in his eyes.  As if she could	weigh it. 		We make our lives, one step at a		time.  We do the best we can.  The		truth about the future?  A promise.		Is only a hope. 		How about the promises we make to		our kids?  About  their  future.  Do		we shrug those off, just that easily?	That slows him down. 		Maybe Annabelle deserves to find		out who  really  broke up her family.		While her mom is still around.	Stops him.  Cold. 			(quiet)		Hey.  Just a thought.	Flips her cigarette to the gutter.  Shrugs... 		You got one less for dinner.	Takes a step back.  Only one.  But it registers. 		Where you goin'? 		I'm gonna get me a drink.	Nods, to herself. 		And I'm gonna drink it alone.	And she walks off.  Slow. 	Ben alone in the back seat.  Reading his beloved Garfield book.	Shift ANGLE to see...	...the women standing by the car.  Rachel looks a little anxious... 		You really didn't have to come,		you know.  I'd have brought them		straight t... 			(staring at something)		Who in the world  is  he?	See now, across the way.  A gorgeous BOY, dressed cool, stands	holding an expensive bike.  And chatting happily with Annabelle.	In the distance, other kids pretend they aren't watching. 		Looks nice enough to m... 		He looks familiar.  Did he do a		Calvin Klein ad?	Across the way, the boy leans, kisses Annabelle sweetly on the	cheek.  Waves to her.  Peddles off.  In distance, kids are dying.	Annabelle pretends not to know that.  Just walks casually toward	us, but as she approaches, she can't help breaking into a RUN,	straight...	...into RACHEL'S ARMS. 			(breathless)		It workeditworkedit worked !  Omi god ,		you can't  believe  the look on his		 face !!!	SQUEEZING Rachel tight enough to crush her bones.  And although	Rachel hugs back, although she kisses Annabelle's hair...	Her eyes are locked to Jackie's.	Houston.  We have a problem. 	Rachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set.  She	is pacing in a circle, looking like a kid waiting to see the	principal.  Sucking her cigarette like smoke was oxygen.  She picks	a bottle of beer off the grass.  Twists the top.  Settles awkwardly	on the seat of the taller swing.	HEAR the screen door open.  Bang shut.  Rachel takes a sip.  Before	she looks up... 			(low, calm)		Now we're going to have a fight,		you and I. 			(barely audible)		Are we. 		And I'm going to win. 			(straight to her eyes)		Don't be too sure.	No anger in Jackie at this moment.  The ferocity of that mother	lion.  The strongest face we'll ever see. 		Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What.		Is 'snowballing'? 		It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h... 		Because there'll be, oh, 20 or		30 mothers phoning me in the		next hour or so.  And they'll b... 		Give 'em my number.	Jackie on the prowl around this swing.  Stalking her prey. 		Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's		mother. 		Is that what you're worried about?		Looking bad at the PTA? 		You are  defending  what you did? 		Right down to the ground.  Let's		get to it.	Not quite what Jackie expected. 		You put filth in my child's mouth. 		Aw. 		You had her  lie  about that...		that fancy-boy  model ! 		Worked.  Like a charm.	Jackie cannot even  believe  this. 		She was beaten, and bloodied, and		it was going to go on, uni... 		So you became the hero.  And I		became the schmuck.	Straightening her spine... 		You taught my child that I am some		limp dick  loser .  Who didn't  care 		about her pain. 		That's not wh... 		You think  I  didn't have some dirty		words for that little putz?  You think		 I  couldn't figure out some low blows? 		You weren't passing 'em out. 		Well, maybe  your  version of growing		up is 'Just win, baby'.	Stalking.  Closer.  Fierce. 		Mine.  Is a  little  different.	Right there.  At the swing.  In her face. 		See, in that crisis, I saw an		opportunity.  For some  real  growth. 		Oh please. 		Shut the fuck up.   I  didn't go		behind  your  back.	The one scored.  Rachel sips her beer. 		Doing the  right  thing.  Knowing who		you  are , inside.  Not  caving  to peer		pressure, or  lowering  yourself to that		level,  steering  your  own  course... 		She wasn't steering her own course,		she was steering  yours . 		Well, that's what parenting is  about ,		little girl.  They are  pleading  to		know how they are supposed to do it.		And you sure as hell  showed  her.	Silence. 		And there will come  another  moment.		When the stakes are  really  there.		And she will look back on this.  And		remember how good it felt.  How easy		it was. 		And she'll fight back again.  God help		me, what have I done.	Jackie's voice drops.  The softness makes it somehow more	menacing... 		You've turned her into you.  And		I may not get another chance.  To		turn her back. 			(suddenly fierce)		 That's  what it is.  And that's  all 		it is.	The hand with its cigarette STABS out... 		 You  won't get the chance.	Jackie back on her heels.  Thinking.  A mile a minute. 		You've got a point there, for a		change.  Oh, yes you do.	HER finger stabbing out. 		 You  didn't get  morning  sickness for		seven months,  you  didn't  breast  feed		till your  nipples  fell off,  you  didn't		spend every  minute  of every  day 		 thinking  and  planning  and  knowing  that		 your  decisions were shaping the  people 		they were going to be...	And now Rachel.  Has nothing to say. 		 You  are gonna be taking Ben's training		wheels off.   You  are the one my little		girl will confess her first  love  to.		You will see them  married , you will		play with their  babies , you fucking		BITCH, I hate your GUTS!	The blast washes over Rachel.  And in the silence... 		Now you're talking sense.	She looks down at her beer. 		All year long, I've been watching how		you do this.  The worries, the sacri-		fices, the signals you give them...	Thinks.  Really thinks.  Wants so much to say this right. 		And I admire you.  More than you'll		ever believe.  And yet...this...		thing...has been growing.  Inside me.	Looks up.  Straight to her eyes. 		For better or worse.  I'm not you.	And so she stands up.  The swing shimmies in her wake. 		I can't live my life channeling the		One True Mom after you're gone.  I		can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't.		Do it.	Sets the beer down.  Stabs out her smoke. 		We have to deal with that.	And walks off, slowly.  Across the yard. 	Huge indoor space.  Wood-sided walls, dirt floor.  High corrugated	metal roof, with birds flying, roosting in rafters.  A little GIRL,	under the keen eye of her TRAINER, puts her mount through its	paces.  In the cold air, steam rises from the horse's body.  It's	late, no one else around.  TRACK now...	...down a walkway.  Toward the stables.  A barn cat is crouched,	stalking prey.  We hear a soft voice, speaking.  One we know... 		It was like telling her...	See him now.  Standing awkwardly, against the side of a stall. 		...that I didn't love her anymore...	See the horse, still steaming.  Standing patiently. 		...if I could be sure I'd always		stay.	Circling the horse now, we see Annabelle's back.  She is slowly	brushing out the sweat mark.  Where the saddle used to be.  Her	movements are stiff, mechanical.  The soft voice continues... 		She said, 'This thing you call a		partnership.  The schedules, the		chores, all the things we have to		work out...'	Our ANGLE CIRCLING to see at last Annabelle's face... 			(softer)		'...for the kids.'	The tears that stand in her eyes.  The set line of her small mouth. 		'...that's the life I dreamed of.		And it's all I ever wanted it to be.'	She swallows.  Because she will not cry. 		That's the kind of person your mom is.		She's the best.	Annabelle says nothing.  She drops to her knees.  Begins to clean	out one of her horse's hooves with a metal pick.  The only sound	against the stillness.	And her father watches.  His heart pounding. 		I complained a lot, baby.  We couldn't		travel, we'd lost our privacy, our		chance to do things on the spur of the		moment.  To live for...ourselves.  The		way we'd started out.	He goes to her.  The sound of his feet on the straw. 		And she said.  Sounds like you'd be		happier.  If the kids weren't around.	Crouches down.  Very close to his child. 		I said.  I love them more than		anything.  But sometimes... I do		miss what I've lost.	Annabelle stops working.  Turns her faces away. 		She said she could never feel that		way, not for one single second.	So he leans closer. 		She didn't want to be with someone.		Who could.	Silence.  He's staring at the back of her head. 		You know, this horse smells		really bad. 		There's worse things.	At least she can talk.  If only just above a whisper. 		Do you know why I never told		you all this before?	A beat.  She doesn't look at him. 		Sure.  You wanted me to blame her.		Instead of you.	Waiting to hear... 			(very softly)		That's right.	She hears honesty.  And heartbreak.  It makes her turn... 		How come you're telling me now?	He gets lost.  Looking in those eyes. 		I don't want to be wrong anymore.	I don't. 		I want to say I'm sorry, because I am.		And let you hate me.  If you have to.	She swallows hard.  Her eyes moving over his face. 		See that feeling?  Where you feel		two different things at once?		That's a grown-up thing.  It's		not a lot of fun.	She shakes her head very slightly.  And her eyes water. 		Know why your mom never told you?	She doesn't. 		She knew that you and her were		so...solid.  Nothing could rock that.		But she didn't want to risk...	The hardest thing.  He's ever had to say... 		...your hating me. 		Cos she loves you. 		Cos she loves  you .  She wanted you		to have a daddy to love.  Even if		he didn't...completely...deserve it.	Now the tears in his eyes.  And she's watching that. 		You know how much love that is?		That she has for you.	Do you. 		There's going to come a moment.		When she'll really need you to		give that back.  And you're just		the girl that can do it.	The way he says this.  Makes her ask... 		Now do I know when?	He reaches.  First time.  Strokes her hair. 		That moment will come.  And your		heart is going to whisper, 'here		it is'	Winds his fingers.  Around her hand. 		And you'll come through.	She stares in his eyes.  And dead straight. 		If I miss it, daddy?  You clue		me in.	Okay, he nods.  That's a plan. 	The dimly chic bar.  With its soft upscale buzz.  Where Jackie	told Luke she had cancer.  Tonight, she waits alone.  Watching the	entrance.  Nursing her drink.  And then...	...Rachel comes into the place.  Spots Jackie across the room.	Weaves her way through the tables.	And she is there.  Slipping into her seat.  Not knowing what to	say. 		Thanks for coming out. 		Neutral ground.  What's up?	Jackie stares evenly.  Her chin rests across the back of her	knuckles.  She looks tired, but okay.  Fueled by adrenaline. 		Luke called.  He says you're		checking out.  Of the Heartbreak		Hotel.	The waitress appears.  Rachel too locked into the moment to notice.	So... 		She likes a Stolie, no ice. 			(softly)		Double.	As the woman leaves... 		What's this about?  Because		we  fought ? 		Don't flatter yourself.			(beat)		I always liked that line.	Signs. 		I love Luke, I love the children.		But there is more to life than		even love... 		No, there isn't. 		And I have looked down the road.		At what my life will be.  And I		can't handle it.	Jackie unblinking.  Focused, strong. 		What do you see?  Down that road.	No answer.  Then... 		I never wanted to be a mom.  Then,		sharing it with you was one thing.		Carrying it alone, the rest of my		life... 		Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme		some truth here.	The Stolie arrives.  They wait a beat.  The waitress disappears. 		Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome,		huh?  You die young, you always look		golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of		burnishes the image, and... 		Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff		who wouldn't help her own daughter		fight back? 		Maybe I was wrong on that one.	That sits there.  In its sincerity. 		Well, maybe you weren't.	And so does that.  Tears are forming in Rachel's eyes.  Here, in	this public place. 		Look, when I said I couldn't channel		you.  That didn't mean I wouldn't give		my right arm to do just that.	Shakes her head. 		Maybe I don't want to be looking over		my shoulder.  Every day for twenty		years.  Knowing someone else would		have done it right.  The way I can't.	Jackie waits.  Thinks. 		Trade you a smoke.  For a secret.	The way she said that.  Something weighty behind it.  So Rachel	reaches into her purse. 		You know, I lost Ben awhile back?		In a supermarket.	Rachel's hand freezes.  In mid-course. 		You're lying. 		I lost him.  I was panicked. 		You are lying, you never lost that		kid for 4  seconds , you could find him		from a  coma , there is no WAY! 			(smiles)		I was running around like a chicken		with my head chopped off.  Doing my		imitation of you.	Rachel still not buying... 		Ben never mentioned it. 		He only remembers I  found  him.  My		point is, telling you this story would		have been the kindest, most helpful		thing I could ever have done for you.	The smile fades. 		Why didn't I? 		Uh.  You hate my guts?	Passing the cigarettes over. 		We were competing.  Even then.	Yes we were. 		Instead of being partners.  Watch-		ing each other's back.  Seeing things		were covered.	Pulls out a smoke.  Offers the pack... 		You're not scared  you'll  think you		don't measure up.  You're scared		 they'll  think it.  That's the JFK		thing, yeh?	Rachel takes one.  Eye contact holding. 		With good reason.  They fucking		worship you as it is. 		What do I have that you don't? 		Everything.  You're...the Earth		Mother incarnate... 		You're the hip and fresh. 		You ride with Annabelle... 		You'll learn. 		You know every story, every wound,		every memory, their whole life's		 happiness  has been wrapped up in		 you , every moment... 		I have their past.	STRIKES the match. 		You.  Have their future.	Rachel stunned.  By the simplicity of it all.  Slowly, she leans to	accept Jackie's flame. 		Don't you get it?  You look down the		road to her wedding.  You're in the		room alone with her, fitting her veil,		fluffing her dress.  Telling her no		woman was  ever  that beautiful.	Tears now.  Standing in two pairs of eyes. 		And your fear is.  She'll be		thinking.  I wish Mom were here.	Jackie lights her own. 		And mine is.  She won't.	Her hand trembles as she takes a drag. 		Now that's enough fear for either		one of us to kill the other.  And		no jury in the  world  would convict.	Jackie raises her glass. 		We're guilty, girl.  Of being human.		And we can't forgive ourselves.	Holds it forward.  In a toast. 		But I forgive you.	And slowly, Rachel lifts her own glass.  CLICKS it with Jackie's. 		Don't rush me.  I'm deciding.  	White Christmas outside the window.  Richly trimmed tree, presents	everywhere, carols softly playing.  The whole nine yards.  Luke and	Ben standing at a wrapped bird cage, where a dove is cooing inside.	Annabelle is setting out the cocoa with a uniformed NURSE.	Rachel enters.  Kisses Annabelle's head. 		I'm gonna check on Mom.	Goes down the hall, every emotion in the world is playing across	her face.  Into... 	Jackie lies on her death bed.  She is beautiful and near the end.	Despite the IV tube, the monitor, she's gotten to serenity after	all.  As close as any of us will ever get. 		Hey, gorgeous.  Time for the		presents?	Jackie licks her lips.  Pretty dry.  Rachel takes a cotton lemon	swab from the nightstand.  Tenderly, cleans Jackie's mouth. 		Now Edna says you short-changed your		last meds.  You can do presents and be		comfortable at the same time, y'know. 			(clears her throat)		Just want to be a little sharper.		For a few minutes.	A few minutes. 		Some things to say.  To the kids,		huh?	Smiles. 		Then, bring in the presents.  We'll		have big fun.	Rachel can't really bear this. 		You know, there's nothing you		have to say.  Because they know		your heart.  You don't have t... 		Just sit me up.  Nice and tall.		Bring Benjamin first.	Staring at each other.  Then Rachel reaches her arms around	Jackie, and as gently as she can manage, lifts her to a full	sitting position. 		Scrapbook.	Rachel brings the big book.  Lays it on the bed.  And goes.	Jackie begins to turn the pages.  Her life with these children	passing before her eyes.  No tears.   No smile.  Just full	attention.  Fingertips touch the one she was looking for, as...	The door OPENS.  Ben, hesitant, enters alone.  His mother's face is	fine and strong and smiling. 		Find the bird cage? 			(standing there)		Rache says it's from you. 		Well, don't make him disappear		before I see him.	Ben nods.  Okay, I won't.  She glances to the scrapbook... 		Oh, look at this.	And forgetting his uneasiness, he runs over, climbs ONTO the bed.	Jackie doesn't wince, doesn't even blink.  Nothing for his memory	bank but smiles.  He looks at the photo...	...Jackie holding a spunky newborn. 		That's you and me.  Our first photo		as a couple.	He nods.  Really staring at it. 		Did you know I was good-looking		right away?	She reaches to hold his face in her hand.  Stares in his eyes. 		 This  good-looking.  Was beyond		my imagination.	She leans.  Kisses his lips lightly.  How many more times will she	get to do this? 			(a murmur)		So what do you think we're gonna		talk about? 			(straight back)		You dying.	She nods.  Her smile is right there. 		The secret of it.  That only		magicians.  Can ever understand.	His eyes brighten.  The sadness pushed aside. 		See, when we die.  Our body goes		away.  Our body.  But  we ...we are		not our body, are we?	He doesn't know.  Maybe he thought we were. 		If a soldier loses his legs in a		war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure		he is. 		But you can still see him. 		Half.  Of him.	This is so fucking hard.  But her eyes stay dry. 		Dying.  Is where the  whole  body		goes away.  So you can't see  any 		of it.   But ...	Rests her hand tenderly.  On his hair. 		What do magicians know?	Leans forward.  Here's the secret... 		Just because you can't see it.		Doesn't.  Mean.  It's gone.	Does it?  And Ben smiles.  He is inside the secret. 		The world.   Thinks  I'm gone.  But		only the magician.  Knows better. 		So where are you?	She was waiting for this.  For a long time.  She wraps her hand	around his fist.  And puts their hands against his heart. 			(a whisper)		Right here.  Right here.   Inside 		the magician.  Shhhh. 		Can I talk to you?  When you're		there. 		Always.  Always.  And you won't		hear a voice.  But in  here .  You'll		know.  What I'm saying.	Yes, you will. 		It's not good enough. 		No, it isn't.  Because it isn't		everything.  And we want every-		thing, don't we?	He nods.  They do. 		But God does let us keep the  one 		best thing we have together.  The		one  best  thing we've always had.		Know what it is?	He doesn't.  But he wants to. 		I love you.  And you love me.	Comes closer.  Nose to nose. 		It's worth a lot.  Will you keep it?	He answers.  With a kiss. 	Luke and Annabelle are doing a hugely complex jigsaw puzzle.  Ben	runs in, falls on his knees by the puzzle.  Without looking at	Annabelle, he tells her... 		Your turn.  It wasn't bad.	Annabelle looks straight to her dad.  There is a moment, a silence,	that no one else could ever understand.  She leans to him and	whispers... 		Here it is?	His eyes water.  He takes her in his arms.  Whispers close to her	ear, only the words... 		Here it is.	She smiles at hi.  Fear gone, filled with resolve.  Gives him a	kiss.  Rises, to...	...follow Rachel down the hall.  Rache wraps an arm around her big	girl.  No words, except a murmured... 		You can do this.	Voice cracking.  She's not as good at it as this girl's mother. 		You can do anything.	At the door.  Open it, and... 	...Annabelle enters alone.  The door closes behind her.  Her eyes	lock with her mother's.  No words.  Annabelle's eyes filled with	tears, and Jackie's arms...	... REACH out, and Annabelle RUNS to them.	They hold each other.  For a forever moment. 		I don't want to say goodbye. 		Don't. Take me with you.	And Annabelle looks up.  Tears on her face. 		Thank God.  I got to see you.		Grown up. 		I'm not. 			(very softly)		Let me be the judge of that.	And Annabelle climbs onto the bed.  Their hands never stop touching	each other.  Saying I love you. 		There's an amazing thing when a		woman has a daughter.  One day you		look up, and you see...a sister.		Someone.  You can say.  Anything to.	Anything. 		I wrote a whole lot of letters.  To		each of you.  And the envelope says		when to open it.  Like, which		birthday.  Or...when you get your		driver's permit.  First time you see		Rome.  Things like that.	Things like that.  Annabelle is beginning to lose it now.  So	Jackie says only... 		Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until		he's old enough to not open them all		at once. 		Until he's old enough to read.	Tears on Annabelle's face.  Her mom wonders... 		Are you afraid for me?  Where		I'm going. 		Yes. 		Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we		all go.  Now how can that be bad. 		I'll miss you so much. 		Good.  That's very good.	She nods, yes it is. 		What you're grown-up enough to		know.  Is that people.  Can do		 two  things at once.  Okay?	She brushes at her baby's tears.  Then tastes her wet fingertips.	Mmmn, surprisingly good.  Annabelle sort of smiles. 		You can miss me.  And.  Take me		with you.	Hold the child's face.  In her hands. 		When you're in trouble.  Have me		there.  When you fall in love.		Have me there.  You can.	Said with such absolute assurance. 		That's how we go on, you know.		Forever.  Because someone takes		us along.	Annabelle swallows hard. 		On your wedding night.  When your		babies are born.  I want to be		there.  Will you take me?	A straight question.  It needs an answer. 		Always, always.  Always.	A sigh.  A shared smile. 		You made my life wonderful.	You. 		Take that with you, too.	Hold.  On Annabelle. 	The presents are here now, they fill up the room, spill over the	bed, where both children sprawl.	...Ben RIPPING the shit out of wrappings like a wolverine,	Annabelle carefully saving her gift paper as if she were going to	hang it in the Louvre.  She holds a tank top up to her chest, for	her Mom's approval.  Jackie's not sure.  Rachel handing up more	boxes, Luke in charge of bagging trash...	Ben's white dove, flying free around the room, zipping and diving.	No one cares.  It's Christmas.	HOLD.  Hold.  And CROSSFADE TO... 	Family and friends are leaving the wake, exiting the softly-lit	chapel into a snowy night.  They are saying goodbyes, kissing one	another, going to their cars.  And saying her last goodbye...	...Rachel turns to Luke.  Whispers, close to his ear.  He looks at	her for a beat, then leads Annabelle and Ben toward the car, as...	Rachel goes back into the chapel.  Alone. 	The room is nearly dark.  One soft spot plays on a simple CASKET.	No canned organ music, no sound at all.  As Rachel enters.	She goes to the casket.  Stares down at it for a beat.  And just	above a whisper... 		See, I told you I'd do this.	Only... 		Only.  Now I don't know what to say.	Her hand reaches out.  A finger absently traces the edge of the	wood.  It seems a gesture of unconscious affection. 		You'd have written it down, so you		wouldn't blow it.	A slight smile.  Here's where the love shows. 		Maybe we should change places.	Nods slightly.  Maybe we should.  She takes a step back now, to a	waiting chair.	Sits.  Her hands folded in her lap.  Thinks. 		Well.  We were less than friends, I		guess.  And more.	More. 		We were never...girlfriends, we		never dished.  That wasn't.  What		we had.	No apology there.  It's just the truth. 		We had some battles, man, they		were...world class, huh?			(beat)		And I don't regret a one of them.	Sad little shrug. 		I miss them.	Thinking.  Of how much more she'll miss. 		We've got our secrets, we have.		And I'll keep 'em if you will.	Crosses her arms.  Lost in the moment. 		But I wish we had one more night.		In that little bar, remember?		Remember that toast?  Sure, you do.	Her voice wavers.  But the eyes are dry. 		Know what?  I forgive me, too.		See?   You're  the magician.	A murmur... 		Don't worry, partner, I've got		your back.  We're covered.	It's what she came to say.  CROSSFADE TO... 	Lights and music and laughter.  They're in black tie tonight.  It's	a wedding party.  Up on the stage, at the head table, some guy is	finishing a toast, and as everyone ROARS and CLAPS... 		...so TO THE BRIDE!  Thank GOD		she's more than he deserves!	Everybody shouts THE BRIDE.  Everybody drinks champagne.	And the bride stands up. In her white gown.  In her hand, an	envelope.  She goes to the mike, and waits for the raucous cheers,	the calls of SPEECH!, to die down.	Leans to the mike.  Flushed and happy.  And, oddly, nervous. 		Now I know the tradition, so		this isn't a toast.  At least...		not for me. 		The guest list is 114.  But we		all know there's one more here,		tonight.  Because...	Looks down the table at her children.  Dressed to kill.  Enjoying	the party. 		...my two sidekicks there always		bring her along.  Wherever they go.	Right?  Right. 		So Jackie and I were sitting		around.  On New Year's Eve.  And		she said, 'You're not gonna talk		at my funeral, are you?'	And now.  It is quiet indeed. 		And I said, 'I've never been to		a funeral.  I'm not sure I'll know		how to act...'	Her sweet smile.  Keeps the mood right. 		'...but I'll prob'ly sneak into		where you are.  Just before it's		over...'	Nods to herself.  Fights back the feeling of that moment. 		'...say something.  Just to you.		Get the last word in, when you		can't talk back.'	There is laughter in this room.  Gentle, loving. 		So she says, 'No way.'	Holds up the envelope.  Holds it tight. 		She wrote this.  She sealed it		up, I didn't see it.  She made		me promise to read it.  At the		wedding.	And slowly, Luke begins to CLAP.  And others join.  And when it	stops... 		I told her she'd better make it		dirty, or make it funny.  Because...		no way...on my wedding...	No way in hell. 		...could she make me cry.	APPLAUSE.  They are loving it. 		She says, 'It's a deal'.	The band plays an impromptu FLOURISH.  Rachel begins to carefully	tear open the envelope... 		Now, if it's too raunchy, we may		have to excuse the kids...	SHOUTS from everyone, ESPECIALLY the children.	She has it open.  She looks at it.	And everything.  Stops.

"                               Written by                           Laurice Elehwany         Setting: MADISON, PENNSYLVANIA 1972                          (to camera)                I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet                 seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids.                 And i've learned to live with this chicken                 Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the                 past three years, so I knew Dad would be                 devastated when he learned of my latest                 affliction.                        (to Harry)                Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left                 breast is developing at a significantly faster                 rate than my right. It can only mean one                 thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.                         (ignoring Vada)                O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of                 the fridge.         Vada closes front door and goes down the steps to a group         of boys                 All right, who's in raise your hand.        All the boys raise their hands except Thomas J                 Are you coming or not Thomas J?                 I don't think so.                 I knew he wouldn't come.                 I can't, I have to go home.                 Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.                 Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.        Group of boys enters house lead by Vada        Once inside, the group is suddenly stopped                         (to boy#2)                Hey, you didn't pay me!                 How do I know you were gonna show us one?                 You're such a baby.                 All right, here.        Boy reaches inside his pocket, gets money out and gives it         to Vada                 All right, follow me and don't say a word.        They walk towards two large doors, stop, and Vada turns         around                You ready?        They enter the coffin display room, and move over to the         coffin in the middle of the room                You sure you wanna see it, or is someone                 gonna go yellow belly?                 I'm not chicken!                 Okay. Lean forward.        A tense moment as the coffin lid is flung open by Vada and         the boys gasp as they look inside                 It's empty!                 You're so weird!                 I want my money back!                 I was afraid of this.        They begin to move into another part of the house                 Of what??                 Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not                 completely dead, you know, like when they cut                 a chickens head off and it still runs around                 crazy.                 You're full of shit.                 I bet she's roaming around this house                 somewhere.        They open the door into the living room, where Grammoo is         in her rocking chair                There she is, in the rocking chair.        Pause, then Grammoo begins to rock the chair gently. The         boys all gasp and then all exit very quickly                 Hi Grammoo.        Vada seats herself upon Grammoo's lap                         (in distance, from                         downstairs)                Vada would you bring down my cigarettes?        Vada gets up and begins to leave                 Seeya later.                        (kisses Grammoo on forehead)                  Did I tell you, he was my woodshop teacher.                 You took woodshop?                 Yeah, I made a tie rack.                 I made a tie rack.        Vada comes down the stairs and stops just before the corner         that would allow her to see the corpse of Mr. Layton                 Ahem.                 Vada, just put 'em on the stool.        Vada places the packet on a stool                 Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly                 yesterday.                         (completely ignoring Vada's                         comment)                Ya, that rack holds six ties.                 I still have mine.        Vada recognizes Arthur's voice                 Arthur!!                 Vada!!                 I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.                 Good for you baby.                 Once you put the hotels on board walk and                 Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.                 I like to buy off all the railroads.        Harry is slightly annoyed at Vada distracting them                 Vada, we're trying to work here.                   Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she                 was gonna make a fur out of 'em!                         (to Arthur)                Hand me the canula.        Vada begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-diddy, Arthur joins in                         (annoyed)                  Dad?                 I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't                 sing.                        (beat)                All right Arthur, just a slide of the                 needle.....                        (fades out as Vada climbs                         stairs)        Vada climbs stairs and stops to read patient note, CAUSE OF                           (to corpse)                One nice model C-501 bronze stainless eternal                 journey, yeah, you look like a champion.                  Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in?                 Sure, come on in.        Vada and strange woman make their way to a desk in the         foyer, and sit down                So, have you had the unfortunate experience                 of recently losing a loved one?                         (puzzled look)                Could I see your Dad, just for a second?        Vada runs across to call downstairs         Vada runs back to the desk                He's downstairs working on Mr. Layton.                 Prostate Cancer. Once it hits your prostate,                 you're a goner.                 Oh.        Harry enters                 How may I... Help you?                 I'm Shelly devoto. We spoke, the other day                 regarding the make up artist job.                 Oh yes.                 It's still available I hope?                 I think it's still available.                 I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for                 two years, at the ""Dino Raphael"" Salon, all my                 customers cried when I told them I was                 leaving.                 Uhh, Miss devoto...                 I have a wonderful disposition, I put people                 right at ease.                 Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at                 ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a                 Funeral Parlor.                 They're dead?                 Yes they are.                 Stiffs??                         (for want of a better word)                Deceased.                 The add just said ""Makeup Artist""        Doorbell rings                 Ahh, excuse me a second will you?                        (opens door)                Hi George, this is a twelve-fifty-eight, I                 didn't want the burnished handles.                        (door closes off scene)        Vada looks out the window at Shelly's camper                 Is that your camper?                 Yes it is.                 That's really cool.        Grammoo walks past in a fixed stare                         (to Grammoo)                Hello.        Grammoo keeps walking as if she hadn't heard                 She's shy.                 Oh.        Harry is standing at the door directing the men with the         coffin                 Just put it back in the display room fellers.                 Okay Harry.        The men move off, Vada walks over to Harry                 Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?                 They come in all sizes honey, just like                 shoes.                 Is it for a child?        Harry hesitates                 Of course not.                 Then who's it for?        Small pause while Harry thinks of a reply                 Short people, very short people.        Shelly walks over to Harry                 Excuse me, what about the job?                 Pardon?                 I need the job.                 Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...                 Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my                 former clients will eventually die, and all                 your clients used to be alive, so they have                 something in common.                 You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering                 the phone.                 Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.                 Great, you can start right away. Call me                 Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally                 wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it,                 very much, but the....                 I promise i'll take good care of these                 people, they deserve it, they're dead, all                 they've got left is their looks.        Harry and Vada exchange weird looks         Vada and Thomas J are riding their bikes through town                 Hey look at this, no feet!                 Oh wow, a real evil canieval.        Vada and Thomas J ride up through a garage         Vada and Thomas J arrive outside the entrance to the         Doctors surgery, Vada enters and climbs stairs, she passes a         small boy in a wheelchair in the corridor, Vada enters room                  Hi Vada, what's wrong today?                 I'm very sick.                 Okay, take a seat, i'll check if the doctor                 can see you.        She picks up phone and whispers something inaudible to the         doctor                 Okay, he'll see you, why don't you go in?        Vada opens door to doctors surgery and enters                  Well, what is it? I can handle it.                 You are perfectly healthy.                 That can't be, I have all the classic                 symptoms.                 Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your                 house today?                 Yes.                 Vada you've gotta stop this, there's                 absolutely nothing wrong with you!        Vada gets up in a mood, puts hat on, and walks to the door,         stopping and says with condescending intonation...                 I'll just have to get a second opinion.         Vada emerges from the building and gets on her bike                 So, what'd he say was wrong with you?        Vada is turning and beginning to ride away                 The whole medical profession is a crack.        Thomas J is trying to catch up                 Hey wait up for me!          Vada slows down, stops and looks at a person on a ladder         painting a house                 Hey look!        Thomas J stops also                 At what?                 That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.                 I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!                 Hi Mr. Bixler!        Mr. Bixler turns around and sees Vada and Thomas J                 Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr.                 J! How's the summer treating you?                 It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the                 books for summer reading.                 Really? Already? The summer's just begun.                 Yes, and now I'm reading War & Peace for fun.                 No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about                 you Thomas J?                 I haven't started yet.                 Better get on his case Vada.        Mr. Bixler gets down off his ladder                 Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old                 house?                 Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.                 This is one big house for one single person.                 Well, you never can tell...                        (Vada gets worried look on                         her face)                I might get a pet.                        (Vada's expression relaxes,                         she smiles)                 How are you gonna get the money for this old                 house if you're not working?                 Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this                 summer, so, I'm doing some work.                 How much does it cost?                 Thirty five dollars.                 What do you get for that?                 Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry.                 This an interrogation Vada?                 No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off                 War & Peace.                 It's summer! You're kids! Go play!        Vada and Thomas J ride off down street                  Wanna go to Gray's orchard and pick some                 peaches?                 No, I'm going home.                 Why? It's not dinner time yet.                 Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go                 home to eat.        Vada accelerates leaving Thomas J in her tracks                Don't pee on the hydrant!!         Vada puts a record on to play.                        (song is ""Wedding Bell                         Blues"")        She then opens a drawer and picks up a class photograph,         with Mr. Bixler enhaloed in a heart shape. Music begins to         play and Vada sings along the first few bars whilst looking         at the photo longingly                  Excuse me Harry, I finished Mr. Layton's                 hair. He kinda looked......                        (she sees Vada lying down                         sprawled out on the floor)                Harry, what's wrong with her??                 Oh, she's just pretending. Vada, get up here                 and eat your broccoli!        Shelly moves over and crouches down next to Vada                         (very sick sounding voice)                I think it's my prostate.        All of a sudden, Grammoo begins to sing                 I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man who                 could ask for anything more? I got daisies, in                 green pastures, I got my man, who could ask                 for anything more?        As this is being sung, Shelly slowly looks up with a VERY         weird expression, this is too much for her         Shelly exits house and closes door behind her, and then         crouches down beside Vada and Thomas J                 Who's winning?                 I am.        As Vada and Thomas J continue to play, three Vada-aged         girls come up to the end of the Sultenfuss' driveway                 Look, there's Vada and her little BOYFRIEND                        (very mocking voice)                 He is not my boyfriend!                 I bet she kissed him on the lips!                 Do you think I kissed that ugly old thing?                 Yeah anyway.                 Come on let's go.                 Judy's father owns the movie theater and we                 get to see all the movies WE want for free.                 Maybe you can come some time.                 Eeeuww, don't invite HER, she'll have to                 bring her boyfriend.        The two girls begin to walk off, Judy follows slowly         looking guilty and embarrassed by her friends                         (together)                Vada and Thomas, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-                I-N-G, first comes love, then comes marriage,                 then comes Thomas J in a baby carriage.        Judy wanders off screen, looking sorry for Vada                 You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls                 upset you.                 I'm not upset. I will never play with those                 girls. I only surround myself with people who                 I find intellectually stimulating.        Thomas J looks at Shelly and smiles, he is proud to be the         friend of such an intelligent girl                         (to Vada)                Want a piece of chocolate?        Vada shakes her head                 Thomas J?                 I'm allergic to it.                 To chocolate?                 He's allergic to everything.                 Chocolate?         Shelly notices a ring that Vada is wearing on her right         index finger                 Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.                 It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.                 It doesn't work, it always stays black.                        (NOTE ring is BLACK)                 It's only black when you're around 'cause you                 put me in a bad mood.                 Maybe black means you're happy?                 I don't think so.                        (pause)                Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?                 She's crazy, she wants to go to school over                 the summer.                 It's not a real school, it's a writing class,                 I wanna be a writer.                 She only wants to do it because her sweetie                 pie's the teacher.        Vada is annoyed that Shelly now knows her little secret and         pushes Thomas J                 Shut your big fat mouth!                 I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask                 your Dad?                 He won't give it to me.                 Well you don't know that. Ask him.         Vada passes Grammoo and Harry who are watching a TV show,         she then seats herself next to Harry                 Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?                 That's a lot of money for a little girl.                 It's for school, for summer writing class.                         (engrossed with TV show)                Any more soda left?        Vada pours Harry another soda                 Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.                 Last month you wanted to play the violin.                 Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.        Harry keeps his gaze fixed the entire time upon the TV         screen                 Dad?                         (referring to TV)                I love this guy!                        (he laughs)                 Dad??                 What?                 The money?                 Ahh, maybe next summer.                 He forgot about the time I wanted to be a                 magician, I was really great at making myself                 disappear.                  Wanna play?                 No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your                 head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.        Arthur grabs ball and begins to dribble it properly as a         demonstration                See. You were looking at the ball. All right?                 Keep your head up. Gimme some skin,        They both give each other five i.e. Slap each others hands,         Arthur exits. Vada continues bouncing the ball, which         accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the         basement         Vada goes very slowly down the stairs, and peeks round the         corner, she is clearly very scared of the basement and the         corpses contained in it, she then rushes down and grabs the         ball. As she turns around, Shelly, who is upstairs walking         through the house and sees the door ajar, slams it shut         unaware that Vada is down there. Vada runs up the stairs and         tries to open the door, she can't, drops the ball and starts         to yell out for help and bang on the it. Shelly hears the         noise and comes to the door. Vada, overcome with fear, sits         on a step, covers her ears and begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-        diddy. Shelly yanks the door open and sees Vada crouched on         the step                 Vada? VADA?? What happened??                         (extremely frightened and                         timid)                My ball, I lost my ball.                         (picking Vada up onto her                         feet)                Come on sweetie.        The two exit the scene                  Excuse me Harry?                 Uh huh?                 Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?                 Yeah.        Harry gets up from his desk, moves over to Mrs. Porter and         observes Shelly's work, he looks unimpressed                Didn't I give you a picture of what she                 looked like?                 Yeah,                        (searches pockets, eventually                         pulling out a photo)        Harry compares photo with Mrs. Porter's face                 You don't like it?                 This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have                 her looking like a two dollar hooker.                         (a little offended)                I think she looks nice! Her lips are very                 thin so I used the gloss to give them a more                 sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a                 little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry,                 nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.                 She did. This photo was taken a month ago at                 the church food drive.                 I just wanted to get past this ""old school                 Marm"" image.                 That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school                 Marm.                        (beat)                Fix it.        Harry begins to leave                 Harry?                        (Harry stops and turns                         around)                I was just wondering, if there is anything                 wrong with Vada.                 What do you mean??                 Well the other night at dinner...                 Oh that, she just likes to play.                 I don't think so, I think she's confused                 about death.                 She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a                 thing or two about it.                 Harry, I really think she.....                         (annoyed)                She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl,                 look, don't give me any advice about my                 daughter, okay?                  There's Shelly!        Vada and Thomas J stop turning the rope leaving Phil         standing there exhausted, and run over to Shelly's camper,         Shelly gets out                 Hi.                 Can we look around in your camper?                 Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.        Vada and Thomas J rush inside the camper                        (surprised at Vada and Thomas                         J's eagerness to get inside)                Woah! Gosh!        Thomas J seats himself at the drivers seat and makes ""vroom         vroom"" noises, Vada sits at the table, selects a book from a         small bookshelf on the side, and begins to read it                 Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you                 really eat and sleep here?                 Uh huh.                 I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.                 Liverpool?                 Big Ringo fan.                 Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?                 I would.                 Thomas?                 Yes please.        Thomas uproots himself and sits opposite Vada at the table                 What are you reading?        Vada makes a gesture at Thomas J with her finger up to her         lips implying that he should be quiet        Shelly notices Vada reading the book                 Oh! You shouldn't be looking at that, it's a                 little too old for you.        She takes the book away from her                 Did you read ALL these books?                 Uh huh.                 What are they about?                 Mostly love, and romance.                 Eeeeuuuww, gross.                 They're just fun to read.        Shelly hands the soda around                Here, cheers.        Everybody takes a mouthful of drink                 Are you married?                 No, I'm divorced.                 Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.                 Well, sometimes married people just find out                 they can't live with each other.                 Mine aren't divorced.        Thomas J gets up and reaches for the cookie jar                Shelly, can I have a cookie?         With bottle of soda in mouth                Hmmmph gurgle gurgle...        Thomas pulls out a few bank notes of largish denomination                 Hey, where are all the cookies??        Vada sees the money and the expression on her face shows         she has an idea                 Well, I guess you found my secret hiding                 place.                 What are you saving for?                 Nothing in particular, just putting it away                 for a rainy day.        Cuckoo clock goes ""Cuckoo."" Lunch time, 12 o'clock                 I'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch,                 thanks Shelly.        Thomas J leaves                 Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head                 back?                 Can I use your bathroom first?                 Sure.                 You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if                 you're late.                 Okay.        Shelly exits and Vada enters toilet with a VERY guilty look         on her face                  The great way, is not difficult for those                 with no preferences, with the absence of both                 love and hate, everything becomes clear and                 undisguised. That was written by a Chinese                 Philosopher in the year 600. Now why would I                 choose to bring that up in a creative writing                 class? Because, the absence of judgment helps                 us to appreciate reality. In other words, I                 want you to listen to your classmates writing,                 with a clear and open heart, okay? So who's                 gonna go first?                 I got one.        He gets up                I sang a song for you to hear, I painted a                 picture for you to see, I picked a rose for                 you to smell, I planted grass for you to                 touch, But you did not hear my song, You did                 not see my picture, You did not smell my rose                 and YOU did not touch my grass.                Woman                Maybe she was outta town?                 That's not funny, his poem is about futility,                 we toil in unrewarded obscurity.                 Now, I hear judgment, let's not forget the                 part about the open heart...        The door at the back of the room opens and Vada enters         holding a writing pad and pen looking nervous                Vada, is there, something I can do for you?                         (very nervous)                I paid the money.                 For this class?                 Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.                 Vada, this is an adult writing class.                 Hey, I think it's real beautiful. She want's                 to be a writer.                 Vada, you sure you wanna do this?        Vada nods her head                 Welcome to the class, go find a seat.        The class applauds                Okay ahh, who's next?                 I experienced something with my boyfriend the                 other day, and I wrote a few words down.                 The floor's yours Ronda.                 He covers me like a blanket, from the cold,                 dark night, As I look into his eyes, I know                 it's right, To touch, To feel, I know he's                 real, Flesh all a mush, Flesh ALL a mush, I                 can't fight it, There's no point, I wake up in                 Lighter joint.        Several looks glance around the room. Vada raises her hand                 Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.                 I wrote a poem too.                 Please.                 Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss                I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good                 when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish,                 This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate                 or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.                That's all I got so far.                 I hear that Vada, Flesh all a Mush or Rocky                 Road, it's about desire.                 Vada that's... It's very sweet, and it rhymes                 and that's also good  but, you're not                 expressing to me what's in your soul. I want                 you to show me how you see the world, your                 fears, your desires, your innermost secrets.                 My fears and secrets. I'm afraid I killed my                 mother.         Shelly gets up smiling when she hears the music and         proceeds to the living room        Shelly pokes her head in the door to see Harry playing a         tune to Grammoo on his tuba                         (sung, to Grammoo)                Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.                 Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let                 you know that the flowers were delivered. And                 the room's all set up.                 Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the                 other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a                 little harsh.                 I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's                 business. It's just that I like Vada, very                 much.                 After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to                 help take care of Vada. They were very close,                 but lately as her mind's been wandering more                 and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm                 sure she'll snap out of it though.                 I'm sure she will.                  Nothing's biting today.                 Maybe they had a big breakfast.                         (hanging from tree)                I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.                 Big deal, I can do that too.                        (Thomas J's reel begins to                         click)                Thomas J, you got something!                 Oh no!                        (he jumps down from the tree)                  Hurry!                 I'm trying.                 Reel it in.                        (Thomas J reels the fish in)                He's only tiny, throw him back.                 I don't like touching fish, how do you pull                 the hook out without touching it?        Thomas J puts his foot on the fish and pulls                 You're hurting him, don't kill him!!        The hook is out of the fish's mouth and sitting on the pier        Vada then removes the hook from the fish's mouth {minor         error in film} and in the process pricks herself                 Ouch! Darn hook!        Vada puts the fish back                 I'm bleeding, did he get away? Go look.        Thomas J looks and sees the fish, dead, floating on top of         the water                 Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.                 Hey, we can become blood brothers.                 Naah, I don't wanna.                 You could pick that scab on your arm.                 It's a mosquito bite.                 It'll bleed.                 If I do it, can we go?                 Uh huh.                 Okay, OW!        Thomas J picks the scab on his arm which begins to bleed                 Okay, rub them together.        They rub their cuts together                 Now we're blood brothers for life.                  Hi.                 Oh Hi, what can I do for you?                 Nothing, I was just wondering what you were                 doing.                 Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you                 know when someone dies people want it in the                 paper usually, it's a service we provide for                 the family.                 Oh right, right,                        (she picks up the newspaper).                 Bader Lorenzo Died June 22                 1972 Devoted husband to                 Nicolette. Cherished father of                 Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu                 of flowers, please send                 donations to the holy names                 society.                 I wrote that.                 No kidding?        Harry gives Shelly a matter-of-fact look                 Oh it's good, ""In lieu of"" I love that word                 lieu.                 I prefer it to ""instead"", it has more                 dignity.                 In lieu... ""instead"".... No contest.                 It's no big deal.                 You have to learn how to take a complement.                        (Shelly turns the newspaper                         over)                Movies, movies, ahhhh, ""Love Story"" at the                 drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?                 I haven't been to the movies in AGES.                 I love going to movies, especially at the                 drive in. I don't think there's anything more                 romantic than going to the drive in.                        (subtle HINT)                I'll let you get back to work.        Shelly begins to exit with a look of failure on her face                 I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to                 join me for a game tomorrow night at church                 you're welcome to.                         (considers for a moment)                Okay.        Harry resumes typing                  Hi Vada.                 Are you going out somewhere?                 No.                 So how come you're putting lipstick on?                 A girl's always gotta look her best.                 I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are                 that color.                 Have you ever tried any?                 No.                 Come here, sit down.        Vada enters bathroom and sits down on the closed toilet         seat, Shelly brings up a stool and sits down in front of         Vada. Vada gets some lipstick put on her                 Now, first we blot.        Vada blots her lips on some tissue                 Take a look. I think it looks real nice on                 you.        Vada looks in Shelly's mirror                 Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?                 Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've                 got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest                 little nose, an amazing mouth.                 The boys at school don't think I am.                 They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna                 bring out the gorgeous color in them. The                 first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can                 never wear enough blue eye shadow.                 Do you like putting makeup on people?                 Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to                 Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the                 stars, I haven't gotten there yet.                        (she finishes her work)                All right, open your eyes.        Vada opens her eyes and looks in the mirror                 Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that                 Hollywood thing.                  Your lip bleeding?                 No.                 What's wrong with your eyes?                 A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.                 Where's your bike?                 Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.        The two enter the garage, where a large black hearse is         parked                 It's only a garage, come on.        Vada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone                 Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably                 fell off in here.        Thomas J walks over to a model of a head                 Hey look at this!                 That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart,                 they used to study the bumps in your head to                 see if you had a good personality or not. Come                 here, i'll diagnose your head.                 No, I don't wanna.                 Come on, it's fun.        Vada examines Thomas J's head and then compares it with the         chart                 Hmmmm, interesting.                 What?                 You have no personality.                 Hey, where does it say that?                 Never mind.        Thomas J knocks the lid off a small box and reveals a photo                 Is that your Dad?                 Yes.                 Who's that with your Dad?                 It's my mother.                 Do you remember her?                 No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.                 What do you think it's like?                 What?                 Heaven.                 I think, everybody gets their own white                 horse, and all they do is ride and eat                 marshmallows all day, and everybody's best                 friends with everybody else, when you play                 sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets                 picked last.                 But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?                 It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular                 horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal                 if you fall, you just land in cloud.                 That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll                 never find that streamer.        As they leave, Vada turns back and grabs the photo, then         returns to Thomas J         The tune ""Moonglow"" is playing on the radio                 Well well well, what's going on in here?                 Nothing, I'm dressing.                 Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry                 Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to                 lie to your big brother?        Phil then proceeds to give Harry a noogie         Phil stops                I'm going out with Shelly.                 Oh yes, oh that's great.                 I'm very nervous.                 Why?                 The last date I had was twenty years ago.                 That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me                 fill you in on today's women, since the last                 time you dated, something happened, ""The                 Sexual Revolution"", now before that, you used                 to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull                 her chair out, pick up the check, no more no                 more, you wanna know what else is missing?                   Oh come on.                 Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this                 woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her                 like every Tom Dick and Harry.                 Are you sure about all this?                 Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?                 Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any                 minute.                 Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the                 right track.                 No, she's just driving over here, then we're                 taking my car. How do I look?                 Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.        Harry runs down the stairs and passes Vada on the way                 Goodnight Vada.                 Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?                 Ahh, I just wanna look nice.                 You never cared before.                 Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go                 together.                 Why?                 She likes to play bingo.                 Can I go too?                 Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep                 Grammoo company.        Harry leaves and then Vada makes a decision, she goes out         the door         Vada approaches the Sennet's house and signals through the         window for Thomas J to come outside, which he does                 Vada? Vada?? Where are you??        Vada springs up from her hiding place                 Here.                 Don't DO that!!                 Sorry.                 What do you want? My mom will skin me alive                 if she finds I'm out here.                 Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo                 tonight.                 I told you i'll get in trouble.                 Pacifist!                 I am not.                 Bed wetter!                 I stopped that!                  Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. For                 instance, on a given night anybody can win,                 but I play the odds, when choosing bingo                 cards, I use a range of theories from the laws                 of probability to avoiding duplicate number                 systems. This way you get much more activity.                         (hopeful)                Does it make it easier to win?                 No. Just, more activity.        Harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it, cutting         Shelly off, who has to pull her own seat out and sit down                         (as he sits down, to the                         person next to him)                Hi Carl.         Vada and Thomas J are walking up to the church                 They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.                 We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.                 Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.                 Duck!        Vada and Thomas J are ducking behind a counter on one side         of the church, Harry and Shelly are quite clearly visible on         the other side of the room                         (in the distance, as a number                         is announced)                Oh great!                 Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.                 Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.                         (in the distance again, as                         another number is announced)                Aarrggh.         As Shelly looks around the bingo table, she notices that         everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big         way                 I just had a terrible thought Harry.                 What's that?                 I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these                 people very soon.                 Why d'you think these seats were empty.                  Can we go yet?                 Go???                 You know I'm not allowed outside my myself                 after dark.                  Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.                 Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending                 upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with                 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy                 with 100.                 Kinda like men.                 Oh, how do you mean?                 You can be in a room with 100 men, and not                 like any of them, or you can be in a room with                 just one man, and he's exactly the one you                 want.        Harry and Shelly are about to kiss each other, Vada sees         this and doesn't look too happy about it                         (in semi-deep fake voice)                  We have a winner. Will the winner please                 raise their hand?                 There was no bingo, it came from outside.                 How could someone outside get a bingo?                 Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone                 outside yelled bingo you moron!                 Who are you calling a mowon?                        (false teeth)                 Put a lid on it Vernon!                 Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years                 old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!!        The two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break         it up                 Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game.        Meanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing                  We can go now.        Vada and Thomas J run off down the street         As she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her         window and looks out it through the venetian blinds         Harry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side         and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers         advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does,         eventually                 I had a good time tonight.                 I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.        They walk up to Shelly's camper                 Would you like to come in and see my house?                 Just for a minute.                 Okay, sure.        They enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room                  Home sweet home.                 It's nice.                 I did it myself. I read a magazine article                 about how to maximize small spaces.                 Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.                 You can look in the bathroom if you want.                 People are always curious about that, like                 what happens when you flush.        Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the         bathroom, and then flushes the toilet                 Yeah.                 Are you mad at me?                 No, why?                 I don't know, tonight you just seemed a                 little cool, not opening car doors and...                 Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice                 on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of                 touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not                 since my wife died.                 What happened to her?                 Ahh, complications during child birth, she                 died two days after Vada was born.                 Did she ever see Vada?                 I brought the baby into the room a couple of                 times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think                 she saw Vada. It was.....        Harry looks at the item that he picked up and was fiddling         with to calm his nerves                Did I ruin this?                 Dance with me?                 Here?                 This is where we are.                 Is there enough room?        Shelly moves an object from the floor, which creates more         room                 I haven't danced in.....                 In ages, I know, me neither.        They begin a slow dance                 Rock?                 See, you're not that out of touch.                        (they dance)                You're good.                 At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot                 date, I did a killer frugue.        Shelly smells Harry's neck                 What are you wearing?                 Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.        They continue to dance                 Do you want to?                 Want to what?                 Kiss me.                 Yes.                 Good.        They then have a long kiss                 Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very                 optimistic.        They then kiss again, this time interrupted by the clock         cuckooing                 I ahh, better go.                 It's only eight o'clock.                 Goodnight Shelly.                 Goodnight.        Harry exits the camper followed by Shelly who stands at the         door                  Well, I guess it's official we had a date,                 maybe we can play bingo again sometime.                 I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that                 drive in of yours.                 Goodnight.        Harry waves         Vada finishes watching, and goes to bed                  Before the class started, Ronda and Justin                 wanted to lead the class in a group                 meditation.                 Ooooh that's really cool.                 Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes                 out into the group.        Justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play         weird music                 Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes.                 Relax your muscles and take deep breaths.                 Now, try to feel what the other person is                 feeling, without speaking any words, send out                 your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at                 the same time. Can you feel it?                 Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody                 feel?                 I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.                 I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth,                 she's so cosmically in tune.                 So right on, that's exactly what I sent out,                 and I felt like, you were full of inner peace                 and harmony.                 Vada, what did you feel.                 I felt Justin's hangnail.                 No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a                 hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul,                 feel my aura.                 I don't think I'm allowed to.                 I tell you what, let's try it again, hold                 hands.                 Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe.                 It got infected and traveled to her vocal                 chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't                 think Grammoo thought it was insignificant.         Vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo,         she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed         and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual         healing                  Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get                 lettuce.        Suddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out                 Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.                 Hi.                 I'm just picking some things up for the                 barbecue.                 Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?                 Not at all. Lot of potatoes!                 It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.                 I'm looking forward to that.        Vada, who is pushing the shopping trolley behind Harry and         Shelly, obviously does not like the idea of Harry & Shelly,         and she rams her cart into Harry                 HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're                 doing.                 Sorry.                 You know this is gonna be my first 4th of                 July picnic in a long time.                 Really?                         (picking up large can of                         prunes)                Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL                 bad?                 Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the                 cart, anything at all.                        (to Shelly)                I don't know what's gotten into her today.        Vada begins to throw cans of every description from the         shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals, not         giving a stuff what they contain                 I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie                 dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas                 I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do                 was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't                 too upset when they took that wrong turn and                 went over a cliff.                    Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to                 use fewer briquettes and now look what you've                 done. You've cremated them.                 That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??                 No, no no....                 Look if you think you know how, why don't you                 pre-measure the briquettes in little packages,                 put out a product, support me for a while!        Phil exits scene, Shelly comes up behind Harry                 How's it going chef?                 Okay.        Vada is seen turning her head to look at Harry and Shelly,         she doesn't like Harry and Shelly standing so close         together, she decides to make her move and pushes in between         Harry and Shelly                 Are they ready yet?                 No, sweetie, not yet.        Shelly begins to brush Vada's hair with her fingers, which         Vada does not like and she shakes her head to get Shelly off                 When?                 Soon honey, soon.        Shelly again tries to fix up Vada's hair                        (which there doesn't appear                         to be anything wrong with)        And Vada shakes her off again                 When??                 In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll                 burn your nose, look out.        Vada backs off, followed by Shelly                   Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.                 I'll second that.                 Hey Shelly, like seafood?                 Uh huh, why?                 See food!        Vada opens her mouth and displays half chewed BBQ cuisine         to Shelly                         (laughing)                That's attractive.        Shelly's glance moves to behind Grammoo on the other side         of the table and beyond, where the two men are standing         looking around                         (under her breath)                Oh shit! Excuse me...        Shelly gets up and moves off to talk to the men, Vada and         Phil turn so they can see what is going on, Harry can         already see, Grammoo just sits staring into space                 Hey Shelly, who lives here?                        (pointing at hearse)                The Addams Family?                 Danny, what are you doing here?                 What am I doing here????? What am I doing                 here?                         (to other man in background)                 Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?                 You told everybody where you were going, I'm                 here for the motor home.        Scene shifts to Vada, Phil and Harry for a moment                 These two people do not have a good                 relationship.                         (in background)                No! _I_ bought it, _I_ paid for it...        Scene shifts back to close up of Shelly and Danny arguing                 I've been living in it for over a year, the                 camper is mine.                 Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the                 lawyer said, it's supposed to be ""OUR MUTUAL                 ASSET"", not ""Shelly's recreational vehicle"".                 Gimme the keys.                 Keep your voice down!                 What?                 The boss is watching us...                         (sarcastic)                I'm impressed.                 God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.                 Yeah, all right...        Shelly and Danny walk over to the table where the rest of         the family are seated, Ralph follows close behind                         (Talking to Danny, pointing                         at the people respectively)                This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada                 Sultenfuss...                 Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.                         (matter-of-fact)                I like my name.                         (to the Sultenfuss')                This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino                 Raphael salon in Detroit.                        (pointing at Danny)                We used to be married.                         (extremely hopeful, to Danny)                Are you here to take Shelly back?        Danny shakes his head at Vada, then Harry gets up and walks         round the table                 Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got                 burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to                 join us?                 Can't stay, I'm just here because my                 wife.....        Shelly quickly interjects                 Ex...ex, ex...                 My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my                 camper.                 Shelly?                 Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I                 promise.....                 I don't think so, I got a copy of the                 property settlement right here.        Danny pulls out a piece of paper                Ahh Shit, this is my lease...... Damn it, I                 keep forgetting things, I'm getting senile.                 Danny?                  Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss,                 and there's really nothing anyone can do to                 comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the                 times you had with the camper, the trips you                 took, the sights you saw, those days are gone                 now, but they'll live on in your heart                 forever.                         (to Shelly)                This guy bonking you?                         (disgusted)                Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!                         (to Danny)                Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.                 Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?                 It's her home! It's where she lives!!                 Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,                        (to Shelly)                Gimme the goddam keys.        Danny tries to grab the keys from Shelly                 Stop it! That hurts!!        Harry is now VERY annoyed                 Danny.....        As Harry says ""Danny"" for a second time he plants his fist         in Danny's stomach with force, winding him and shutting him         up                   What'd you do that for??                 Who are you?                 I'm his brother.                 Oh then you'll probably be visiting us here                 quite often.                  Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's                 camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front                 yard.        Ralph looks rather disturbed by this                          (quiet voice, to Vada)                Your father is a savage.        Vada looks up at Phil, Phil looks back and nods                  Bye Ralph.        The car with Danny and Ralph in it pulls away and Shelly         waves                         (to Harry)                Well, you were pretty great!                 Is it really your camper?        Shelly makes gesture with her right hand suggesting ""sort         of""        Suddenly a sky rocket screams up in the sky and then         explodes, Harry and Shelly look up and watch the fireworks                 Can we see it from the back yard?                 You can get the general idea...        They move off to the back yard...                 Yep, there they are... They always look the                 same every year...         Pointing upwards Look...                 Did you ahh, love him?                 I would never marry anybody I didn't love.                  He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit                 anyone in his life.                 He likes her.                 Does he love her?                 Probably.                 Do you like her?                 Yes I do, and I think she's very good for                 your father.                 Why?                 After your mother died, he was sad all the                 time, but before that, he was pretty funny.                 Really?                 Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he                 seems like the old Harry.                 My Dad was funny?                 Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but                 he made me laugh.                 My Uncle fought in the Korean war, he had a                 steel plate put in his head, Daddy said he                 didn't come back the same, one night, he                 picked up a radio station from Oklahoma in his                 teeth, it was really neat.                  Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.                         (with stick in mouth)                Carnnk yu sheeee ik??        Dr. Welty removes stick from Vada's mouth                 Can't you see it?                 No.                 It's there.                 Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your                 throat.        Vada looks at the Dr.'s certificates up on the wall                 Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours?                  So you fill it with water like this, and what                 have you got? A water gun.                 Cool, can I get one for Vada?                 Oh yes, yes.        She gets another one out of her drawer                Thomas, let me ask you a question. Does Vada                 ever tell you why she comes down here so much?                 Cause she's dying.                 Do you think she is?                 No.                 Why do you think she says that?                 Cause she gets scared of all those dead                 people in her house, and you know that saying,                 If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if                 she's one of them, she won't be as scared.                 You know what I think? I think Vada's very                 lucky to have a friend like you.        Nurse Randall hands Thomas J another syringe                 She's my best friend.        The door to the doctor's surgery opens and Vada exits                 Miss Vada, how are you feeling?                 As good as can be expected.                  Hey Vada, guess what we got?                 What?        Thomas J begins to run, and as he passes Vada he squirts         his syringe at Vada                         (squirt)                         (squirt)                I'm gonna get you!!!                        (squirt)                I'll get you!!!!        Vada at this point is unarmed, and she chases Thomas J down         the stairs         Suddenly Thomas J stops in his tracks                 Woah!!                 What?         Pointing There's a beehive right there!                 So?                 Stand back.        Thomas J stands a pace back behind a branch on the tree and         begins to squirt the beehive                 Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!                 You're right, let's knock it down.                 What do you want it for anyway?                 For their meat.        The two start throwing rocks at the hive, which gets         damaged and eventually falls to the ground                 Got it!                 My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!        They begin to search for Vada's mood ring        Suddenly bees begin to swarm, luckily Thomas J notices in         time                 They're alive!! Run for your life!!!        Vada just stands there looking, Thomas J comes back and         grabs her arm, this wakes her up and they begin to run                 Run faster they're after us!!                 I am running faster!!                 Hurry!!!        They have run to the spot with the weeping willow and the         pier, they run out on to the pier                 Jump in the water!!                 But I have my clothes on!                 Do it!                           (in the distance, from                         upstairs)                Vada is that you?                 Yes..                 Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival                 tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.        Vada likes this news, she hurries up the stairs                 Shelly's coming with us.        Vada is now not so happy                  So Vada, what's your favorite ride?                 I like the freak show.                 I know, I know, let's go on the ""sit on the                 bench and rest"" ride.                 I don't think that that roller coaster agreed                 with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have                 to watch what you eat here, I remember one                 time I went to a carnival with my cousins                 David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs,                 and the next day they came down with                 nephritis.                 Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't                 get it from hot dogs.                 Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next                 day they had really high fevers, and their                 faces got very fat. They baffled medical                 science, they were in a magazine.        Vada and Harry give Shelly a ""yeah RIGHT"" look                 They were!! ""Popular Mechanics"", no ""Popular                 Science"". I don't know, popular.                  Oh look they're trying to hit that poor                 thing.                 Watch you don't knock out a fish.                 Perfect.                 I don't know which ball's mine.        Vada gets a ball in a bowl                 I won, I won!!!                 Oh great!!                 Hooray, we have a winner,                        (picks up fish in plastic                         bag)                There you go little girl.                        (gives fish to Vada)                See how easy it is folks!        Shelly inspects fish, holding it along with Vada                 Oh Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish.        Vada notices something on Shelly's hand                 Where'd you get that ring?        All of a sudden Shelly looks up with a guilty look                         (extremely hopeful)                Did you win it?        Harry and Shelly exchange looks, Harry smiles, followed by         Shelly                 Vada we have something to tell you. Harry?        Harry sits down on table and looks at Vada in a matter-of-        fact way                 Vada we have some good news, Shelly and I are                 getting married.        Vada's expression begins to change from hopeful, to horror,         but then she drops her fish                 Oh my fish!!!        Vada quickly bends over to pick up the fish                 We're having the wedding sometime near the                 end of the summer.         Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little         fish.                 Vada? Would you like us to get you another                 goldfish?                         (angry)                NO!, He's fine.                        (less angry, talking to fish)                Fish are very resilient animals you know.                 Don't worry, I won't get another fish.        Shelly and Harry exchange worried looks, Vada doesn't seem         to have understood                  Oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival                 and not ride the bumper cars.                 I fall asleep at the wheel.                         (malicious grin)                I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!                 Oh great Vada, come on...        They run off leaving Harry to carry the teddy bear and the         fish                         (to the attendant)                Uhh, two.                        (to Vada)                I got the blue one!!        Vada runs in past Shelly and seats herself in a car                  Yes!!        Shelly gets in the blue one                         (pointing at Vada)                I am gonna get you.        Vada straps herself in, Shelly turns around and gives Vada         the thumbs up, Vada looks VERY intent on brutally murdering         something now, and she returns the thumbs up, as she does         so, music begins to play and the power is turned on, the         song is ""Bad Moon Rising""                 Vada, keep your hands on the wheel!!        Vada rushes straight at Shelly and rams into her at top         speed, so that Shelly's car is spun around a little, Shelly         screams, this is all in good fun, at the moment. Then Vada         rams her again, and again, and again, and again, and         eventually, Shelly does not look too pleased, she can't         escape Vada                 Careful Vada, careful.                 Shelly LOOK OUT!         Shelly and Vada pull up along side each other, Vada gives         Shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin         Vada rings the Sennett's doorbell, and Mrs Sennett answers                 Hi Vada.                 Hi, can Thomas J come out?                 Sure, come in.        Thomas J is coming down the stairs                 Hi Vada.                 Hi, wanna ride bikes?                 Sure.                 Ohh, did you make your bed?                 Yes.                 You're sure?                 It's made.                 Come here, you've got a milk mustache.        Mrs. Sennett wipes Thomas J's lip                 Come on, let's go.                 Bye Mrs. Sennett.                 Bye Ma.                 Have fun kids.        The two exit the house                  I'm running away.                 Where you running to?        They get on their bikes and begin to ride off                 California, I'm going to Hollywood to live                 with the Brady Bunch.                 I wanna live with them too.                 No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll                 have to live with the Partridge Family.                 Really?         Thomas J stops and then does Vada                 That's it.        Thomas J goes and sits down on the river bank, Vada follows         with an annoyed look                 Get up!?                 I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past                 this place two times already. We're not                 getting nowhere.        Vada sits down next to Thomas J                 Why are you running away?                 My Dad gave Shelly a ring.                 Wow, was it a decoder ring?                 You're such a retard, it was an engagement                 ring.                 They're getting married?        Vada nods her head                 So now you'll have a mother.                 I don't like her.                 I do, she's real funny.                 He likes her better than me.                  I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.                 Then go home, baby.                 I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.                 Leave then, some friend you are.                 You can come to my house for dinner?                 No, I'm hiding out.                 Okay, seeya.        Thomas J climbs down from tree, and leaves          Vada jumps down, and we can now see that the tree was on         the Sultenfuss' front lawn         As soon as Vada has entered, she waits for someone to come         running and ask her if she's all right, where she's been,         they were so worried etc., Nothing happens, all she can hear         is the noise that the TV is making. So she opens the door         again and slams it. Still nothing. She decides to give up,         and go find Harry, she walks to the living room where the TV         is on, Harry and Grammoo are asleep in their chairs        Vada begins to ascend the stairs, depressed                 In social studies we learned some people                 stole the Limburg baby right out of his house,                 I think i'll sleep with my window OPEN                 tonight.           Vada bursts out of the bathroom and screams down the stairs                 DADDY!! Daddy daddy!!!! Daddy!!??!?!        Vada runs into a room where Shelly is                 Daddy??!?!?!                 Vada, Vada, what's the matter?                 Where's Daddy?                 Well he just left, what's wrong?                 I'm hemorrhaging.                 What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?                         (very weak, scared voice)                I don't want, I don't need your help....        Vada tries to run away, but Shelly stops her                 Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?        Vada nods her head                 How old are you?                 I'm eleven and a half.                 It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have                 a little talk.        They exit                  My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?                 It's actually a very beautiful thing, and                 look there wouldn't have been a Vada.                 I think it should be outlawed.                 Believe me, some day, you'll feel                 differently.        Door bell is heard ringing                 Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna                 see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to                 boys.                  Hi Vada, can you come out?                 I dunno..                 Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go                 swimming?        Vada is angered by this, she comes storming out         Vada pushed Thomas J hard enough to make him fall over, she         is angry                Get outta here!! And don't come back for five                 to seven days!!!        Vada runs inside and slams the door, leaving poor Thomas J         sitting on the porch looking startled                   Grammoo, I'm going to the bathroom, i'll be                 right back.        She then gives Grammoo a little kiss, and makes her way out         of the living room to the bathroom, closing the door behind         her, as she goes to enter the bathroom she hears giggling         coming from the next room, so she goes to investigate. Harry         and Shelly are kissing and giggling. As she is watching         this, Grammoo gets up, enters the funeral room and makes her         way to the front, when she gets there, she picks up a rose,         takes a look at the dead man, and begins to sing into the         rose as if it were a microphone                 It's quarter to three, there's no-one in the                 place, just you and me.        As this is being sung, Vada hears and turns around with an         OH SHIT look on her face, Harry and Shelly also hear it         and make off for the funeral room, Vada quickly retreats         into the room where Harry and Shelly were, closing the door         behind her                So santa-macho, I got a little story you                 oughtta know, we're comin' my friend, to the                 end of a brief episode, so make it one for my                 baby and one more for the road.                 I'm so sorry, it's all right ma, I'm very                 very sorry.          Grabs Vada by the shoulders                 Now what were you thinking, huh? HUH???? It's                 your responsibility to watch her!! Do you have                 any idea how upset those people are in                 there???!        Vada breaks free from Harry's grip, and walks briskly out         of the room. Shelly looks back at Harry expectantly                  Why do you think people want to get married?                 Well when you get older, you just have to.                 I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.                 You can't marry a teacher, it's against the                 law.                 It is not.                 Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's                 and it won't be fair.                 Not true.                         (nervously, uncertain)                Have you ever kissed anyone?                 Like they do on TV?                 Uh huh.                 No.                 Maybe we should, just to see what's the big                 deal.                 But, I don't know how.                 Here, practice on your arm like this.        Vada brings her forearm up to her mouth and starts to kiss         it, Thomas J follows                 Like this?                 Uh huh.                        (they kiss their arms for a                         while)                Okay, enough practice.                 Close your eyes.                 But then I won't be able to see anything.        Vada raises her fist                 Just do it.                 Okay, okay.                 Okay on the count of three.                  One.                 Two.                 Two and a half.                 Three.        Vada leans forward and kisses Thomas J on the lips, they         both look surprised, Vada then sits back against the tree,         long pause                 Say something it's too quiet.                 Umm, Ummmmm                         (agitated)                Just, hurry.        Thomas J stands up and begins to say something along the         lines of...                 On political agents to the flag of the United                 States of America,        Vada stands up and joins in                 And to the republic for which it stands, one                 nation, under God, individual, with liberty                 and justice for all.        When they finish, they both still look a little         uncomfortable                  You better not tell anyone.                 You better not either.                 Well, let's spit on it.                 Okay.        Both of them raise their hands to their mouths and spit on         them, they then shake hands and when finished wipe them off         on their trousers                 Seeya tomorrow.                 Okay, seeya.                        (Vada starts off down the                         road)                Vada?                 What?                 Would you think of me?                 For what?                 Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.        Vada smiles, and gets on her bike                 I guess.        As Vada rides off, Thomas J smiles         Thomas J comes across the beehive, inspects it and then         kicks it, he waits and then once he is adamant that there is         no danger, he begins to search for Vada's mood ring, he         searches, and as he does so, bees begin to swarm, he finds         the mood ring, and by the time he notices that there are         bees everywhere, it is too late..                         (as he finds the mood ring)                Yes!                         (reacting to the bees)                Ow, ahh, NO!, Get away!!!        We see Thomas J's glasses fall off onto the ground         A policeman enters, takes his hat off and explains what has         happened to Thomas J to Harry, who becomes clearly very         distressed                  Hi Vada.                 Hi.                 What are you doing.                 Feeding my fish.                 Is that the fish you won at the carnival?                 Yes.                 He's getting big.                        (sad pause)                Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.        Vada sits down next to her Dad                 Vada, something happened to Thomas J last                 night, he stepped on a beehive.                         (beginning to look worried)                I told him not to tease those bees. Did he                 get stung?        Harry nods                 Maybe I should go over and yell at him.                 No sweetheart, you can't.                         (looking very worried)                Why not?                 He was allergic to bees.                         (extremely worried)                He's okay isn't he?                         (shakes head, near tears)                There were just too many of 'em.        When Vada hears this, her eyes begin to flood with tears         and the expression on her face changes movingly, it looks as         though she just lost the most special and important part of         her life. And she has                  Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??                 Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?                 I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.                 Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look,                 come up here and we'll have a look.        Dr. Welty lifts Vada up onto bed                 It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.                 What Hurts Vada?                 The bee stings! I can't breathe!           Knocks Vada?        View shifts to inside Vada's bedroom, where she is curled         up in a little ball on her bed                I'm leaving some food for you by the door, in                 case you get hungry.        Vada remains where she is, the doorbell rings                  Hi.                 Hi, is Vada home?                 Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's                 not seeing anyone.                 Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I                 wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.                 Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of                 days.                 Will you tell her I came by?                 Sure.                 Thank you. Bye.                 Bye.        Shelly closes the door                  Hi Harry.                 Ahh, Reverand Miles.                 The Sennetts want to thank you for taking                 care of things so quickly.                           (knocks)                Vada? I see you took your tray in,        Vada is looking out her blinds at all the black cars and         people dressed in black entering her house                Maybe you should come down for the funeral,                 sometimes it helps. Vada?                  She won't come out. It's been a whole day.                 You have to do something Harry.                 The funeral's starting.        Shelly is now very emotional                 Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her                 only friend in the world is dead.                 I know that, but what do you want from me?                 Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I                 first came here, the idea of working with dead                 people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I                 saw a family lived here, I thought, ""if I'm                 living without a family, at least I can work                 with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be                 invited in for supper.""                 Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted                 because there's a car crash, or there's a                 fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.                 I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those                 people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't                 ignore the living, especially your daughter.        Arthur enters                 Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the minister's about                 to begin.                 Thank you Arthur.        Shelly exits                  We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett. He                 was born, May 7 1961, in Madison,                 Pennsylvania, and he was survived by his                 loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett......                        (fades as camera changes)         The minister is heard to say this in the background                 The family has asked me to say a few words                 before we proceed. No words that I could say,                 would begin to describe the loss and grieving,                 one word that keeps ringing in my ear is                 Why?. Why would God choose to take this                 little boy from us? I can't give you an answer                 to that question, but I can tell you that God                 has chosen Thomas J for some very special                 reason, we must find solace in knowing that                 Thomas J is now in Gods care. In that face,                 there is no sorrow such as....        The ministers words fade into the very moving music         Vada stops and sits on a step where she can look through         and see Thomas J lying in his coffin, she begins to cry                  ....disciples began to chastise them, and                 Jesus said ""Let the children come to me, do                 not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God                 belongs to such as these.                        (the minister notices Vada                         coming around the front of the                         room)                He laid his hands on their heads before he                 left that place, let us pray in silence.        Vada has made it right up to the coffin, which she leans         over and crying, says the following                 Wanna go tree climbing Thomas J?                   His face hurts, and where is his glasses? He                 can't see without his glasses! Put his glasses                 on!                        (Harry and Shelly are rapidly                         approaching Vada, Shelly takes                         hold of her and tries to pull                         her away)                Put on his glasses! He was gonna be an                 acrobat.                 He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!                 Get away, get away!!        Vada breaks away from Harry's grip and runs out of the         room, followed closely by Harry and Shelly                  Vada wait! Vada! Vada!!        Harry stops running after Vada as she sprints off down the         road        Vada arrives at Mr. Bixler's house                 Vada! I was just on my way to your house. Are                 you all right? I'm so sorry about Thomas J.        Vada covers her ears and begins to sing ""doo-wah-diddy-        diddy""                 Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him,                 Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him,                 it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?                         (crying)                Justin and Ronda say that I should tell                 people what I feel.                         (nods)                Come here, sit down over here.        The two of them sit down on Mr. Bixler's porch        Vada is clearly in a lot of pain and she wants it to stop                 Mr. Bixler,                        (emotional pause)                I love you.                 Oh, Vada...                 I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna                 live here.         Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss         you.                 No he wouldn't, I can't go home.        A woman appears at Mr. Bixler's front door                 I'll be ready in a second, I just can't seem                 to find my other earring....                 Suzanne, this is Vada.                         (comes over to Vada and                         crouches)                Vada, hi, I'm really sorry.                 Could you just give us a minute?                 Yeah.        Suzanne goes back inside                 Who's that?                 That's Suzanne.                        (pause)                She and I are gonna be married this Fall.        As soon as Vada hears this, she reacts, shaking her head         and backing off                 No....                 I...I was gonna bring her to class next week.                 I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please                 honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada,                 Vada sweetheart don't.....                 Get away from me!        Vada runs off down the road         Vada is climbing around in the tree, clearly trying to get         somewhere of significance                 Why do you think people wanna get married?                 When you get old, you just have to.        Vada pulls out her photo of her mother                 Who's that with your Dad?                 It's my mother.                 I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.                        (pause)                Vada, would you think of me? Well if you                 don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.                 Now we're blood brothers for life.        Vada gets out to the end of a branch, and makes a daring         jump to another, had she fallen she would be dead                  Shelly I'm sorry but we haven't found her                 yet.                 It's dark, she can't be alone in the dark.                 We'll keep looking.                 We, no, we've been looking since this                 morning, her teacher called, and he said that                 she went there first.....                 I know, I know you told us.                 But I....        Shelly is cut off as the door opens and in walks a very         shaken Vada                 Vada. Are you okay?                        (Vada nods)                Oh God.        Shelly embraces Vada                  I should have told Thomas J that he was my                 best friend.                 I'm sure he knew.        Shelly puts a nightie on Vada                 Shelly, I stole some money from your cookie                 jar, to pay for the writing class.        Shelly ponders this for a moment                 It's okay sweetheart.                 I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll                 ever go to class again.                 I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first                 book to me, and we'll forget about the whole                 thing.                 I will I promise.                 Okay, get in to bed.        Vada gets into bed and extends her arms to Shelly, they hug         each other, Vada has finally accepted Shelly                 Goodnight.                 Goodnight.        Shelly exits and turns off the lights                          (sitting on stairs)                She's in.         Harry enters, walks over and kisses Vada, then turns around         and begins to exit                 Did I kill my mother?                 What??                 The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my                 mother.                 No, no.        Harry pulls up a chair and sits down next to Vada                 No sweetie that wasn't your fault, things                 like that aren't anybody's fault, it just                 happened.        Vada pulls out the photo of Harry and Vada's Mom from under         her pillow                 I found this.                 I forgot about that picture, where did you                 find it?                 In the garage.                 Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers                 favorite car.                 What was my mama like?                 She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes.                 Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when                 you laugh, you sound just like her.                 Really?                 Uh huh. You know what your mother did when                 she found out she was gonna have you? She came                 home and painted this whole room pink. She was                 so sure she was gonna have a little girl.                 Do you miss her?                 Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and                 even now, I get a little sad when I think of a                 pretty flower or a sunset that your mother                 would have liked.                 I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll                 think of Thomas J.                 That's good, memories are good sweetheart.                 Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from                 you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and                 I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump                 like me.                        (Vada puts the photo back                         under her pillow, Harry gets                         up and kisses her)                Seeya in the morning.        Harry begins to leave room                 Daddy, it's not so bad to be like you.         Harry makes his way out of the cafe to talk to Mrs. Sennett                 Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?                 Some days I think i'll be okay, others, well                 I have to force myself even to get out of bed,                 I know it's crazy, but sometimes I think he's                 just away at summer camp. How's Vada?                 Oh she's doing much better. Ahh she's just                 inside.                        (walks over to entrance)         Vada, who is inside talking to someone, hears and comes         outside                 Mrs. Sennett.                        (she runs and gives her a                         hug)                 Vada. I've been wanting to come over to see                 you,                        (she reaches inside her purse                         and gets out something, it is                         Vada's mood ring)                Thomas J had this on him, I thought you might                 like to have it.        Vada slides the ring onto her finger, the ring is BLUE                You were such a good friend to him, I hope                 you'll still come by and visit me.                 I will, I promise.        Mrs. Sennett looks at Harry as if to say good-bye, and then         walks off slowly                 Mrs. Sennett.                        (she stops and turns around                         to look at Vada)                Thomas J will be all right, my mother will                 take care of him.                 Thank you Vada.        She then turns and walks off                          (reading from book)                Encased in talent, like a uniform, the rank                 of every poet, is well known. They can amaze                 us like a thunderstorm, or die so young, or                 live for years alone. My advice to you on our                 last class, be a thunderstorm.                 What exactly do you mean by that?                 I mean, be dangerous                        (Vada enters the back of the                         room)                And unpredictable. And make a lot of noise.        Mr. Bixler sees Vada                 Vada.        As Vada is noticed, she goes around getting hugged by         everyone                 Hey, we missed you man! Gimme a hug!        Vada gives Justin a hug, she then proceeds towards Mr.         Bixler                 I was hoping you'd stop by today.        Vada and Mr. Bixler hug each other                 I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.                 We'd love to hear it.                 Weeping willow with your tears running down,                 Why do you always weep and frown, Is it                 because he left you one day, Is it because he                 could not stay, On your branches he would                 swing, Do you long for the happiness that they                 would bring, He found shelter in your shade,                 He thought his laughter would never fade,                 Weeping willow stop your tears, There is                 something to calm your fears, You think death                 as if you forever part, But I know he'll                 always be in your heart.        There is a long pause as it sinks in, everybody remains         silent, then just before the scene changes, the Temptations         song ""My Girl"" begins to play                  Hi Judy.                 Hi Vada.                 Things are a little better these days; I                 finally swallowed that chicken bone, Judy and                 I are gonna be in the same home room and the                 republican party just re-nominated Mr. Nixon.

"                               Written by                             Sean Penn                        Based on the book by                            Jon Krakauer      Tuesday, April 28th 1992    WIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits    beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in    North America. This is BIG Alaska.    A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper    left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and    comes to a stop. A figure exits the passenger side and    moves around the front of the truck. We can just make    out the rifle sticking out of his backpack. We HEAR a    very distant ""Thank You"" as the figure walks away from    the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere.               Hey!    The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK,    stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of    the truck.               Come here.    BACKPACK walks back to the truck.    As he approaches the    driver's door, we    CUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto    the DRIVER.                      (referring to items we see                      sitting on dashboard)              You left your watch, your comb, your              change...    We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks:               Keep it.               I don't want your money.    And I already              have a watch.               If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it              away. I don't want to know what time it              is, what day it is, or where I am.               I don't want to see anybody. None of             that matters.The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pullsout an old pair of rubber work boots.                     (handing him the boots)             Take em.There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting theboots.              If you make it out alive, give me a call,             and I'll tell you how to get the boots             back to me.We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has takenthe boots and is putting them on but we STAY on thedriver.              Hey, do me a favor, will ya?     Take a             picture of me.Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and startswalking backwards. We PULL BACK with him. And hemaintains his back to us. When he stops, we CONTINUEuntil he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing. CU: driverCLICK.   He snaps the shot.Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER.          Driverhands him the camera.              You gonna be alright?              I'll be better than that.                    (I'll be who I am.)As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past theconcerned face of the driver onto the loose change, thecomb, and the watch on the dash.     Throughout the ZOOM, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE    SNOW, FADE into the distance.      We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form    of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the    Backpacker has exited the frame. The truck takes a BEAT,    turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the    direction from which it came. As the truck exits frame,    we -       May 1990    The crowd of family and friends, and of course, students.    Assembled on fold-out chairs. The broad lawn.    INTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don't see his face, just    feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace.    One by one the names of graduates announced. Their    bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to    the podium to accept their diplomas.    INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head.    Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE    MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark    striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and    CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist    length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck.    They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in    sight.    INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO    CAMERA, the water streaming down his face.    From the announcement podium comes the name of their son    and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. The    McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris'    absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap    and gown. Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podiumplatform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESSleaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound,frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine""That's our Chris."" And just as quickly as Chris hasbeen handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platformsteps. SLO-MO: A ballet of graduation caps float upward into aframe of blue sky. We HEAR Chris' voice OVER this imageas we intermittently cut away from the caps against thesky to focus on his parents.(HIGH ANGLE: floating caps in FOREGROUND, Walt and Billiedelight upon the caps.) An outer glee in sharp contrastto voice over:           I see them standing at the formal gates          of their colleges,          I see my father strolling out          under the ochre sandstone arch, the          red tiles glinting like bent          plates of blood behind his head,          I see my mother with a few light books at          her hip          standing at the pillar made of tiny          bricks with the          wrought-iron gate still open behind her,          its          sword-tips black in the May air,          they are about to graduate, they are          about to get married,          they are kids, they are dumb, all they          know is they are          innocent, they would never hurt anybody.          I want to go up to them and say Stop,          don't do it--she's the wrong woman,          he's the wrong man, you are going to do          things          you cannot imagine you would ever do,          you are going to do bad things to          children,          you are going to suffer in ways you never          heard of,          you are going to want to die. I want to          go          up to them there in the late May sunlight          and say it,          her hungry pretty blank face turning to          me,                her pitiful beautiful untouched body,              his arrogant handsome blind face turning              to me,              his pitiful beautiful untouched body,              but I don't do it. I want to live. I              take them up like the male and female              paper dolls and bang them together              at the hips like chips of flint as if to              strike sparks from them, I say...    The last graduation cap falls out of the `blue sky'    frame, and into...      (Graduation ceremony wardrobe)    Walt and Billie sit at a table. A Cadillac can be seen    through the window (ATLANTA LANDMARK), parked beside the    restaurant.               Here they are.    Walt looks out the window and sees Chris drive up in his    old yellow Datsun with Carine in the passenger seat    beside him, and pulls up to the space beside the    Cadillac.     Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the               I say...Do what you are going to do,              and I will tell about it.               Who wrote that?               Well, it could've been either one of us,              couldn't it?    He hands a book of Sharon Olds' poetry to her.               There's a lot of great poems in there.                Thanks, big brother.    They exit the car and frame.     Chris and Carine join Walt and Billie at the table.    Billie gets up and gives Chris a big hug.               You scared the daylights out of me,              jumping on to that stage, oh my god.    Chris gives Carine a look.   Walt extends his hand to    Chris.               Congratulations, son.    They all sit and pick up menus.               I'm starving.      The foods on the table.   Chris is devouring a steak.               My grades are gonna be good enough, I              think, to get into Harvard Law.               That's a big deal. What do you have left              in your college fund?               It's an inheritance, dad. I've only been              spending it as a college fund...Exactly              twenty-four thousand five hundred dollars              and sixty-eight cents.               That's very specific.               I had to go to the bank this morning.            Well, we'll certainly contribute the          balance for Harvard.           Yeah. I've got to figure out what I'm          going to do. I got a lot of things to          pack and organize here first.           I'm so glad you're getting out of that          place you're living. It was so much          nicer when you lived on campus.           You'll come to Annandale before you          disappear on us, won't you?                  (reluctantly)          Sure, I will.Carine's not so sure.           You promise?                  (whining)          Mom.           Well, your father and I want to make a          present to you.           We want to get you out of that junker.           What's a junker?Walt points outside to the Datsun.           The Datsun?           Yes.   We want to get you a new car.                  (appalled)          A new car? Why the hell would I want a          new car? The Datsun runs great.                       (Mocking the Cadillac)              Do you think I want some fancy boat? Or              are you worried about what the neighbors              might think?               We weren't going to get you a Cadillac,              Chris. Just a nice new car that's safe              to drive. You don't know when that              thing's just going to suddenly blow up.               Blow up? Blow up?! Are you guys crazy?              It's a great car. I don't need a new              car. I don't want a new car. I don't              want anything. Thing, thing, thing.    Under the table, Carine jabs Chris' leg.    Chris returning    to polite -               But, thanks anyway.               Everything's gotta be difficult.               I said thank you. I just don't want              anything.    The group returns to some superficial calm.               I wouldn't say no to a new car.                      (mumbling a rib)              Ivana Trump McCandless.                      (laughing it off)              Shut up, Chris.                     (to her parents, seriously)              Seriously, I'll pay you back.      OVER Chris' shoulder, he frisbees his graduation cap from    the upstairs window to his parents parting Cadillac on    the street.     As they wave goodbye, Carine catches the cap from the    backseat window. And with a parting smile to her    brother, she poses with it on her own head. Chris smiles    and waves goodbye.    As the Cadillac drifts away, his smile disappears into    something other than sadness.      In a warm ambient light, we SEE a black and white poster    on a barren wall: Poncho-clad Clint Eastwood from ""The    Good, The Bad, And The Ugly.""    We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor -    Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak.    Beside them, a camper's backpack.    Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight.    The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle. But    on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank    envelope. He pockets those bills and change, then removes    a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the    same bank envelope. He scribbles a note: These are all    my savings. Feed someone with it. Signed, Chris    McCandless. He then slides the note and the check into a    pre-addressed Oxford Famine Relief Fund (in Boston)    envelope.    He pulls his wallet from his back pocket. Pulls all the    cards and pictures from its sleeves. Considering each,    he flicks them into a trash bin, one by one. Finally    coming to his social security card, he holds it to the    candles flame. As the flame burns bright we -      MUSIC (Gordon Peterson's BIG HARD SUN or as radio source    Tom Petty's FREE FALLING) rises and PRESENTATION TITLES     A 1982 DATSUN B210 emerges from the rising sun as the car    heads west out of Atlanta. (HIGHWAY 20 TO 78 TO 40)    PRESENTATION TITLES and MUSIC carry OVER: MONTAGE: We travel with Chris and his Datsun through thetowns and open highways, landscapes and landmarks, daysand nights, that lead to the Mojave desert in the West.      (In contrast to his introspection of the previous night,     Chris is buoyant throughout this sequence.)      (CRANE SHOT) We see Chris stop the Datsun in the middle     of the desert road. We (CRANE?) DOWN to a close-up     through the windshield. Chris looks left. Then, right.     Into the rearview mirror, and suddenly turns the wheel,     veering the Datsun off the paved highway into the vast     desert.     As we CRANE back UP, the Datsun moves into the horizon.        The Datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just     before darkness slides over the desert. It is positioned     at the foot of a wash wall that edges the soup bowl.      The Datsun, a yellow speck in the frame. Coyotes yap at     the moon. Other than that, no sound on the desert floor.     In the distance, voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil     upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting     sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed.     We see strobe bursts of lightning followed by muffled     thunder illuminating the thunder clouds from within.     Short SERIES OF ANGLES as we MOVE IN on the distant     gullies and ravines, starting to run with copious amounts     of water.      Chris McCandless, in the same clothes he had been in back     in the rooming house, sleeps in the back seat of the     Datsun. His head supported by his backpack. We begin to     HEAR a rumble. But this rumble is not thunder. It     rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR. The roar grows to     a deafening level. Chris awakens.      As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through     the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the     leading edge of a flash flood. A four-foot high wall of     water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun,     momentarily enveloping it in water. Suddenly the car is     SLAMMED against the cliff. CRACK! Chris sits upright,     disoriented.     POV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight,     water has taken over the desert with a flash flood.     However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe     him past a new crack in the wet windshield. The water,     while violent seems to have topped off just above the     wheels. Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the     car settles into its new position below the cliff. He     returns to sleep.       What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile     beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor.     We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA     TRACKING/TRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash     through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint     maker, Chris. Slogging toward high ground.     WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile     behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack.     He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's     stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as     much wilderness before us as we did behind.       Chris walks into the distance.    Chris McCandless speaking to camera holds a microphone ina shadowy room, doing his Geraldo Rivera. It's tongue-in-cheek at best.           This is Emory University freshman Chris          McCandless reporting from the vault at          Thompson Hall.He indicates a hatchway in the floor leading to abrightly lit corridor below.           We have just dynamited the hatchway and          are the first human beings to step foot          into this vault in over a hundred years.          Somewhere in here lies the secret of the          great beast within us all. A beast built          on lies, corruption, and greed.We HEAR a GROWLING SOUND from behind Chris.           And there it is! The legendary beast          Mocra.CAMERA quickly PANS to a blanket-wrapped, crawling FELLOWSTUDENT in a grotesque Halloween mask.We MOVE INTO CU on the monster growling.QUICK PAN back to Chris.                  (in mock fright)          We've got to get out of here quick and re-          secure the hatch while we make a plan of          how to kill the beast.CAMERA SHAKES all over like a bad horror film trying tostay with Chris as he makes a quick escape down thehatchway into the University dorm corridor.CLUMSY VIDEO TIME CUT: Chris nailing the last nail inthe hatchway from below. He climbs down the steps wherehe exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off-camera source.           Well, it looks like we've succeeded -We HEAR the monster's GROWL from above.                 - at least for the moment, in sealing the               beast back into the vault. Your humble               reporter, Chris McCandless will now               struggle with the journalistic question               of ethics: Will he retain his reporter's               objectiveness or save the future of human               truth by slaying this awful beast?     He gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will     he do?      We pick up with Chris in a corridor outside a door with a     cheap paper-and-tape label announcing the adjacent room     as the office of Ted Turner.                Once again, your humble reporter Chris               McCandless.     We HEAR OS students commenting on Chris and his video     crew:                What is this? Filmmaking 101?                Point the camera at me. I'm a star.     Chris speaking straight to camera, still tongue-in-cheek:                       (with a Wizard of Oz tone)               Pay no attention to the voices behind the               curtain.      A FELLOW STUDENT PLAYING TED TURNER with obvious fake     mustache is locked into an episode of Matlock on his     television set as our bold reporter, Chris, barges in.                Ted! We've got a monster in the vault.               It represents all the corruption, the               deceit, and greed within us all. I must               slay it.                   (worst acting we've ever                  seen)          McCandless, how many times have I had to          tell you? I've had to tell you that you          are a journalist and you can't get          personally involved in your cases...or          your stories.           Ted! I know how to kill it. And I'm the          only one who knows. You can't keep          sending me on stories and expecting me to          do nothing! I look like some kind of an          idiot.           Do you know who you're talking to?   I'm          Ted Turner.Behind Chris in the corridor outside Ted's office, aPANICKED STUDENT arrives at the door.           McCandless! You've got to hurry! The          monster is scratching at the hatchway.          He'll be out in no time.                  (threatening)          It'll mean your job, Chris McCandless.                  (to Ted)          That's it, Ted. Fire me if you want but          this beast must be slayed.Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste. The CAMERA RUNSWITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set ofsteps to the hatchway. As he arrives, the monsterappears above him in the hatchway crawl space havingpulled off the board Chris had nailed.                  (into camera)          This is the only thing that can kill the          monster. It's gonna be risky but without          great risk, there is no freedom. So we          will now hear from the famous singer -          Chris McCandless. A piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris. A YOUNG BLACKSTUDENT pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins toplay. Chris begins to serenade the monster,intermittently sharing the serenade directly into cameraas well. He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender IsThe Night.CAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway,slowly dying from the song being sung.As the song continues to be sung and the monstercontinues to die, the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO            When we were little, Chris was very to          himself. He wasn't anti-social, he          always had friends, and everybody liked          him - but he could go off and entertain          himself for hours, he didn't seem to need          toys or friends. He could be alone          without being lonely. The secrets our          parents kept, though unknown to Chris and          I, led to bouts of rage and even violence          between them that we had been forced to          witness since we were very young. It          seemed like they never fought without us.          I remember the first family meeting to          let Chris and me in on their plans for          getting a divorce. They wanted us to          choose which of them we'd live with. I          cried my eyes out. But the divorce never          happened, though the threats and meetings          never stopped. It wasn't long before          Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom          and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.          Chris and I just wanted to get away from          their fights and mom kept promising to          get out and take us with her as soon as          their company made enough money. Dad had          been the young genius [that] NASA          enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the          American satellite radar systems that          would be our answer to the Russian          Sputnik. And mom and he later started up          a consulting firm combining her get-up-          and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of          knowledge. By the time the company          actually made its first million, the          careerism and money seemed to erase her          memory of the promise she'd made us.                 I think this is when Chris began to see               ""careers"" as a diseased invention of the               twentieth century and to resent money and               the useless priority people made of it in               their lives. He'd begun planning to               ""slay the beast""...to make himself free.      The beast dies.        We see a pile of berries sitting atop a handkerchief.     Beside them, a survivalist's guide to edible growth.      The glare of the sun penetrating the canvas. A fly     buzzes and lands, hanging upside down. The image is     blurry.      Delirious in the heat, we WIDEN OUT to see that he's     filthy (2 weeks of growth on his face and naked.) He     makes his way out of the tent, peers at the relentless     sun and scurries to his backpack where he removes a     canteen, barely a sip of water left in it. He downs it.       The following short vignettes are silent and focused     exclusively on Chris:     1. Recreational BOATERS on Lake Mead. GIRLS in bikinis.     BOYS on boats eating Kentucky Fried Chicken.      2. At lake-side, an unusual sight - the NEW Chris     McCandless, a sun and dirt-beaten bum with a backpack.      3. A family ski-boat has taken Chris on. They give him     water, dropping him at the north end of the lake at     TEMPLE BAR MARINA. (Director's Note: HIGH ANGLE, TIGHT,     sees Chris and the glimmering water treadmilling below)      4. Chris washes himself in the lake by the marina.         Chris brushes his teeth.                I need a name.     He takes a swallow of water. Rinses his mouth. Spits it     out. Then checks his bearded face in the mirror. He     likes what he sees.     As he wipes the corners of his mouth with a tissue and     throws it into the bin below the sink, he notices a     discarded tube of lipstick. He picks it up. It's down     to its end. Yet with what lipstick remains, he writes on     the mirror:       Chris is behind the cafe beside a pair of dumpsters. He     removes the Datsun's license plates from his backpack and     discards them deeply into the garbage.       Chris appears from behind the cafe lugging his backpack     up the rise from the cafe to the highway and starts     thumbing for a ride.        VARIOUS shots to accompany V.O.                 Toward the end of June, Chris had mailed                our parents his final grade report.      Walt and Billie open the envelope.                 Almost all A's. ""A"" in Apartheid in                South African Society and History of                Anthropological Thought; A- in                Contemporary African Politics and the                Food Crisis in Africa; and on it went.                Clever boy, my brother.      We observe Carine in a delicate afternoon light. She is      sitting up on her bed with an unread book, looking out      the window toward us.                 But by the end of July we hadn't heard                anything from him and my parents were                getting very worried.      Carine's POV:   Walt with his arm around Billie in the      yard.                 Chris had never had a phone, so they                decided to drive down to Atlanta and                surprise him.        Chris, backpack on, walking away from camera.        We see Walt and Billie's car pass under an Atlanta      mileage sign.                 When they arrived at the apartment, there               was a ""For Rent"" sign in his window, and               the manager told my parents that Chris               had moved out at the end of June.      We observe Walt and Billie chatting with Chris' apartment     manager.                When they got home, I had to hand them               all the letters they had sent Chris that               summer which had been returned in a               bundle.      The bundle of letters are splayed out on the kitchen     table - ""Return to Sender"" stamps visible.                Chris had instructed the post office to               hold them until August 1st so that mom               and dad wouldn't know that anything was               up. Some part of me understood what he               had done. That he had spent the previous               four years fulfilling an absurd and               onerous duty in graduating from college.     We return to the image of Carine sitting on her bed as     she plops on Chris' old graduation cap. We slowly ZOOM IN     on her throughout the remaining V.O.                And now, at last he was unincumbered.               Emancipated from the stifling world of               parents and peers. Abstraction,               security, and material excess. Those               things that cut Chris off from the raw               truth of his existence. I only hoped he               was safe...and I missed him.        TRACKING SHOT (GROUND LEVEL): CLOSE ON Chris, surrounded     by a summit grove embraced in its nature.     ANGLE: A DEER drinking from a creek, pops its head up     between trees and scrub, watching the alien human pass.     An EAGLE soars above (perhaps it was this POV represented     in our helicopter shot)     WATER babbling in a mountain creek.      ANGLE: Chris -   In his eyes we see the landscape inject     itself.       SEQUENCE: Chris makes camp beside a stream pulling a sack     of rice from his backpack and cooking it.      Wrapped in his own ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly""     poncho, Chris eats rice while crouched beside a campfire     reading from Jack London's White Fang.       Chris is on the move north through the gorgeous landscape     of the Sierras, humming as he walks, when he comes upon a     sign on the trail: PERMIT CAMPING IN DESIGNATED      Chris bows to the sign as one would to speak to a small     child.                       (singing)               Sign, sign. Everywhere a sign. Fuckin'               up the scenery, breakin' my mind.                   Do this. Don't do that. Can't you read                 the sign?     And then, very impulsively, he karate kicks the sign off     its post into a log collapsing into ---        A burning log collapses in Chris' campfire, reduced to     glowing embers.      Chris is awakened by the SOUND of TWIGS SNAPPING in a     nearby thicket. He quickly grabs a knife from his     backpack, unzips six inches of the tent door open. We     see his eyes peering out. The CRACKLING moves closer.     His grip on the knife tightens.     Suddenly a hot white light hits his face.   And a VOICE     comes from behind the light.                  U.S. Forestry. Could you step out of the                 tent please?     Now we see the FOREST RANGER appear from the thicket.     Chris exits the tent, catching himself holding the knife.                        (as he drops the knife to the                        ground)                 Sorry. I thought you were a bear.                         (approaching)                 I don't blame you. You're less than a                 hundred yards from the nearest den.                 That's why I came over here to talk to                 you. Do you have some identification?            No. I'm sorry. My name's Alex. I've          been travelling a lot and I got robbed          and my identification was taken.           You mind if I take a look in your tent?           Go ahead.The Forest Ranger bends over. Pops his flashlightthrough the tent door and peers around a bit before re-addressing Chris.           You're not the character who knocked down          our sign, are ya?                 (giggles)          No.           Because there was a sign indicating that          camping was allowed by permit only.           Well, I don't have a permit.           No, I'm sure you don't. Listen, it looks          like you've got your food secured pretty          good, so I'm not gonna make you move on          tonight. But, these bears out here are          nursing young and you know how that goes.          Next time, stop at the Rangers station          and get yourself a permit.           Alright. I appreciate it. I'm gonna be          headed towards the coast tomorrow.           Be careful.They shake hands and the Forest Ranger disappears intothe thicket.        Chris descends the mountains where they meet the      Redwoods. Every perilous step creates a mini landslide      down the hill; dirt and gravel.      Chris stops briefly to observe an over-flying commercial      airliner.                        (mocking imaginary                        conversation among                        passengers)                Is that a man mommy?                That's no mere man, sweetheart. That's                Alexander SuperTramp! King of the wild                frontier!      Chris briefly waves to the airplane above and continues      his descent.         A car slows to a stop.                  This is where I turn off.                 Alright man.    Thanks a lot.      Chris is dropped off. The driver veers off the highway      and into the distance. Chris is left behind to hitch      another ride.       CAMERA is across the road from Chris as one by one cars      pass him by. He turns to move north by foot and we track      with him, his back to oncoming traffic, he continues to      hitchhike with an extended thumb. Something catches his      eye in the treeline beside the road. REVERSE: Chris, moving to the mysterious object. As helifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat.He dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when apolice car comes into frame and stops beside Chris.With a quick blast of the siren, Chris turns to regardthe police car. The POLICEMAN gets out of the car andmoves to Chris.           How're you doin' this evening?                  (reluctantly)          I'm alright. What's the matter?           You wanna put your backpack down on the          hood of my car.Chris does not oblige.           Why?           Because I asked you to, sir.           But I haven't done anything wrong.   These          are my personal items.           Do you know that it's unlawful to          hitchhike on this stretch of highway.           You're kidding.           Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to          stop? We got a tree-lined highway          without a substantial shoulder here. And          we've had a lot of accidents on this road          from people stopping in the traffic lane          for hitchhikers.           Alright, but...I mean, you stopped your          car. You're in the traffic lane. And          you can see, there's hardly any cars out          here. Plus, it's a straight road; you          can see for a long ways.                        (in disbelief)               There's really been accidents along here?                May I see some identification?     Now Chris is worried.                I don't have any.                You don't have any identification?     Chris shakes his head ""No.""                       (pulling out a ticket)               Well, I'm gonna site you for unlawful               hitchhiking. You don't have to appear.               You can send a check directly to the               Humboldt County Clerks Office for               restitution. If you don't pay it within               30 days, you're subject to fine and               warrant. I'm gonna trust that you're               gonna give me accurate information.               What's your name?     Chris can't bring himself to lie.                       (a beat)               McCandless. Christopher Johnson               McCandless.       Walt, Billie, and Carine sit around the kitchen table in     August. A copy of Chris' ticket has been sent to the     Annandale address and sits before them. Billie and     Carine sit silently. Walt's on the phone.                If Chris were trying to disappear, it               would have been a pretty uncharacteristic               lapse for him to give the police his real               place of residence. Though my parents               had already contacted the Annandale               police with their initial concerns, this               ticket arriving from California made them               frantic.                 My father called one of his old               government friends who put him in touch               with a private investigator, someone               who'd done work with the DIA and the CIA.               Using the Willow Creek ticket as a               starting point, the investigator began               chasing down leads. Most of them led far               afield -- to Europe and South Africa.               Ultimately turning up nothing. What my               dad couldn't believe was that he'd given               up his car. He seemed to love that               Datsun so much. It sounded just like               Chris to me, though. He was very much of               the school that you should own nothing               except what you could carry on your back               at a dead run.      With his backpack lunging and a free hand holding his     goofy new hat onto his head, we find Chris at a ""dead     run"" to catch a ride that had overshot him. (Director's     note: Don't leave this image too soon.) An old van idles     waiting for him. As he gets to the passenger side, the     woman passenger gets out. This is JAN BURRES, early     40's, looks to be still on the long road home from     Woodstock. A little heavyset, dark wavy hair with a lot     of premature grey in it.     Jan moving to the side door.                Hi. We just barely saw you there, under               that crazy hat of yours. We couldn't               back up - the van's reverse is broken.                        (as Jan fiddles with side                        door handle)               Oh.   That's okay. Thanks for stopping.                This door's a little tricky, I'll get it.     And with a little pulling, it opens. Indicating the pony-     tailed and bearded driver (RAINEY), early 50's,     definitely Woodstock...                Hop in, that's Rainey.                 Hey, I'm Rainey.                And I'm Jan.                Hey, Rainey.    Hi Jan.    I'm Alex.                Alex of the hat.                        (closing the side door)               Yeah.     Jan jumps back in passenger seat and the van rolls on.                  Were you out there a long time hitching?                Couple of days. But sometimes I forget to               put my thumb out.                Probably, the rest of the time, that hat               scares `em away.     Chris checks himself in the rearview mirror and gets a     kick out of what he sees (That hat's staying on.) Jan is     looking at the rearview mirror too, observing Chris with     mild concern.                When's the last time you ate something?     Chris pulls out a bag of berries and edible plants he's     collected.                       (excited)               See that? I've got this book and it               shows you all the plants and berries that               are edible. You can find things wherever               you go.     Jan steals a glance to Rainey.      He's hip.                 We were just in town getting some beads               and stuff. Jan does handicrafts, so               we're usually going from one swap meet to               another. She's so good at what she does,               we sold everything. So, we set up camp               at Orick Beach. You're welcome to camp               there with us.                And eat there with us.     Chris is beaming at the thought of real food.       Chris, Jan, and Rainey are beside a campfire, sitting on     blankets. Their tents loom behind them.     Jan is weaving some sort of craft art. Chris is chomping     on chicken and beans like they're going out of style.                       (between large swallows)               So, I just left the car. It was a great               car too. I'd driven it cross country the               first time when I got out of high school.               I had some really great adventures with               it. That thing would just go and go. I               mean, it was an `82 but if I'd kept it,               it would've lasted me forever.                So, you're a leather now.                I'm a leather?     Rainey nods, smiling.                       (looking to Jan)               What's a leather?                You're a leather tramp. That's what they               call the ones that hoof it on foot. So,               we're technically rubber tramps.                   (interjecting)          As we have a vee-hi-cle.Rainey makes a move to put his arm around Jan. She goesa little stiff and fends it off. Chris notices.           Alex could have a vehicle. If he didn't          burn his money. Why would you want to do          that?           I don't need money.   It makes people          cautious.                  (a little irritated)          Well, you have to be a little cautious          Alex. That book of yours is all well and          fine but you can't depend entirely on          leaves and berries.           I don't know if you'd want to depend on          much more than that.           Where's your mom and dad?           Makin' their money somewhere.           Come on Chris. You look like a loved             *          kid. Be fair.                                    *           Fair?           You know what I mean.           I'll paraphrase Thoreau -- ""Rather than          *          love, than money, than fairness, give me         *          truth.""                                          *           You look like shit.   There's the truth.         *They all laugh.                                            *        Chris sits up reading, his tent entry flap ajar to let     the small candle lantern ventilate.     OS we HEAR a ZIPPING SOUND. It's Rainey. We see him     from Chris' POV coming out of his tent deep in thought.     As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the     campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris     can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood     into the center of the fire. The tapping is slow and     thoughtful. Micro-embers float upward into the night.     Chris' tent flap closes by his own hand.     ANGLE: Chris' dog-ears his book and puts out the lantern.       We see Chris foraging for firewood in the bluffs above     the beach. He's got it tied to his back and his front.     If we didn't know better, we'd think he was camouflaging     himself.     Chris' POV: The rocks beside the water's edge. We see     Rainey sitting beside the water, staring out to sea. We     follow Chris' gaze to Jan, some fifty yards down the     beach, walking melancholically in the opposite direction     of Rainey.     ANGLE: Rainey at the water's edge.   Chris appears beside     him.                       (regarding Chris wrapped up                       in wood)               Geez. If I struck a match to you, I'd               have warmth and dinner at the same time. But Rainey's humor does not hide an inner turmoil.           Where's Jan going?           Well, my friend, all is not well on the          hippie front.Chris pulls out his pocketknife, cuts the twine thatbinds the firewood to his body, and takes a seat besideRainey.           You're an industrious little fucker,          aren't ya... Yeah, it's funny how things          happen at particular times. I've loved          that woman for a lot of years. But you          know, she's got a...story. We've been          going through this thing real quietly          cause, well...So, after running into you          last night, this thing we were going          through quietly, she started talking          about. You know what I mean?           I think so.           You think what?Chris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance.           I think she's probably quietly          disconnecting. It doesn't feel right to          her to be close to you if there's a hole          of some kind somewhere else.           That's a helluva insight. Jesus!...          You're not Jesus, are you? You gonna          walk on that water and get her back for          me?           Actually, I'm a little afraid of water.Rainey gives him a sideways glance.           It's true. But it's something I've got          to get over sometime.                 So, I'll swim in it if you'll carry the               firewood back to the campsite.                I'll carry.   Shit-yes I'll carry.     And with that, Chris runs down the beach toward Jan.     Rainey watches Chris and Jan chat briefly. Then they     strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean,     splashing and laughing.     ANGLE: Rainey. A warmth comes over him, watching his old     lady having some fun. He grabs two armfuls of wood and     heads to the campsite.     ANGLE: Chris and Jan swimming in the chilly water, having     a ball.     Jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness     and joy with Chris. And Chris allows it. She pushes the     stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends     below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and     laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of     her toes is pulled on by the big fish Chris. As he re-     surfaces, she gives him a splash right in the face.       Through a burning campfire in the late afternoon, we see     the chilly bodies of Chris and Jan carrying their clothes     run shivering toward us.     Rainey sits beside the campfire.                I thought you guys might need a little               heat.     Jan smiles appreciatively.                       (moving to Rainey)               That's not hot enough. Put your arms               around me.     As they embrace, Chris throws a coat on from his tent,     puts on his funny straw hat, and grabs a book.     Rainey has wrapped a blanket around Jan and they sit     beside the fire.                 I'm going to go down the beach a ways and               read a little bit. I'll bring the rest               of that wood back before nightfall.                Alright. We might take a run into town               to grab some food for tonight.                Sounds good.     He heads off down the beach.       1. The ocean moving toward sunset.     2. Seagulls, gliding inches over the water.     3. The breeze on the sea grass.     4. Chris in his big hat reading at water's edge.     5. Jan and Rainey deeply engaged in conversation beside     the fire.     6. Chris closing his book, remaining meditative at     water's edge.     7. Jan and Rainey in town, buying groceries and being     playful with each other.     8. OVER Chris' shoulder, the sun sets and day becomes     night.       Jan and Rainey on a blanket sharing a joint. Chris lying     beside the campfire in his sleeping bag. Jan takes a     toke, passes the joint to Rainey.                You know what Alex ought to do, Rainey?               He ought to come out to the Slabs this               winter.            Oh yeah.Rainey takes a toke on the joint.           You'd like that if you're still on the          road. Lot of fellow travelers.Rainey offers the joint to Chris.   Chris passes it upwith a hand gesture.           What is that? The Slabs?           It's down in Niland, California.   You          know where the Salton Sea is?           Near San Diego, yeah?           Well about 200 miles Northeast of there,          but yeah. Niland's off the east shore of          Salton. Wild place. The navy bulldozed          and abandoned a base there. All that's          left is a grid of concrete foundations.          They're scattered over about a square          mile or so.           When the weather turns cold across the          rest of the country, people show up there          by the thousands: snow birds...           Drifters...           Sundry vagabonds...           Like ourselves.           Livin' on the cheap under the sun.           You sell your handcrafts there?                 Oh yeah. And a lot of second-hand goods.               There's a swap meet. The people are               cool. There's even some kids running               around sometimes. Most everyone there,               if they're not avoiding the cold, are at               least dodging the IRS.                Or the FBI.   CIA! DDT!!!     The three of them laugh.                It's good. You should check it out. If               you come, I'll make a proper hat for you.                      (standing, shaking out her                       blanket)               Well, Alex. I'm gonna clean up and the               old man and I are gonna get some rest.                      (indicating the sleeping bag)               Looks like you got yourself a good bag               there.                Yeah...my mother made it from a kit.     Jan sees an almost imperceptible mother pang in Chris,     but he pushes it away quickly.                I'm gonna sleep out here by the fire.     I               want to read a little bit.     Jan moves to Chris, hugs him, kisses him on the cheek.                You're wonderful.   Don't make me worry               about you.       The fire is burning low. Chris reads from Thoreau's     WALDEN from the chapter on ""Higher Laws"" as we move     slowly in toward him, we begin to HEAR quiet sounds of     what may be love-making coming from Rainey and Jan's     tent. A gentle smile comes over Chris' face and in its     irony, he looks to the page before him.      Chris' sliding fingertip underlines the following     passage:     Chastity is the flowering of a man; and what are called     genius, heroism, holiness, and the like, are but various     fruits which succeed it.       Gulls pierce into the grey morning ocean, snapping from     schools of fish. And the subtle crackling of a     campfire's death. There on the beach, Jan and Rainey's     van, their tent, and the fireless coals of last night.     But no sign of Chris, his bag or his tent.     Jan appears from her tent, rubbing her eyes. She wears a     sarong which she re-secures at the breast, then notices     that Chris has left. But where his tent had been, the     words:      are spelled out in the sand with bits of driftwood.     CU: Jan - We see her sadness. Rainey appears at her     shoulder. He understands what is inside his woman.                He reminded me...                I know.     Go to WIDE SHOT: Jan and Rainey remaining as they were.     FOREGROUND: Seagulls GLIDE THROUGH FRAME.       MUSIC OVER: Joe Henry's King's Highway      1. Chris hitchhiking through the Sage Brush Uplands     2. Chris squatting over a water bucket, shaving.      3. Camping in the lava beds of the Columbia River Basin.     4. Walking across the Idaho Panhandle.     5. Cooking the last of his rice on the Montana border.     6. Hitchhiking in the Montana sunset.      We see Chris hitching down a lonely two-lane road     surrounded by fields and distant mountains.                In early September, mom and dad got a               call from the Annandale police notifying               them that Chris' abandoned car had been               identified by the Arizona Highway Patrol               after a group of rare flower hunters               stumbled upon it in the desert. There               were no signs that Chris had intended to               return to it. But there wasn't any               evidence of struggle. The police said               they thought Chris had chosen to leave it               behind and not that it had been taken               from him. Nonetheless, the initial               comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly               turned to their realization that Chris               was actually trying not to be found.      We see Walt. He walks out the door of his house into the     street. He keeps walking. And we go with him in his     silent but internal Armageddon. We PULL him in CU     throughout all that follows...(Refer to SCENE 171: ""Dad     calls it `suspended animation.'"" This may affect our     visual approach)                The year Chris graduated high school he               bought the Datsun, used. He wanted to               drive it cross-country and visit our old               neighborhood in California. The day               before he left was my dad's birthday.               Chris made a speech...       Chris stands beside the family piano, speaking to a party     of his parent's friends, Walt and Billie among them.     Beside him, a large gift-wrapped present. Carine sits at     the foot of the stairs at the back of the room watching     her brother with a hint of concern.                       (a little drunk, a little                       emotional)               Dad, you and I have had our differences               over the years...but on your birthday I               want to tell you how grateful I am for               all the things you've given me. And that               you did it starting from nothing to               working your way through college and               busting your ass to support us kids. So,               in return, I've been busting my ass a               bit...at Domino's Pizza -     Chris moves to the gift.                and I've gotten you this token, this               damned expensive token, as a token of               that appreciation.     Chris holds the large gift toward Walt. Walt moves     through his friends to Chris and strips the paper,     exposing a beautiful Questar Telescope.                       (patting his son the back)               Would you look at that.     Walt holds the telescope up for all to see.   And the     party responds with applause.     Chris walks through the cheering family friends to take     his place beside Carine at the bottom of the steps.                Jesus, you must've had a lot to drink.                Too much and not enough. I used to               believe all that stuff. That whole               story. I thought maybe if I said it               again, I'd believe it. But I don't.      Tears have come to Chris' eyes. He puts his head in his     hands. Carine puts an arm around him.       PRESENT:   Walt expressionless, walking into camera.                 The day after the party, Chris left on                his trip and ended up staying away most                of the summer. It was nearly three months                before he walked back into our house in                Annandale. He had a scruffy beard, his                hair was long and tangled, and he was                rail thin. As soon as I heard he was                home, I ran into his room to talk to him.                In California, he'd looked up some old                family friends who still lived there.                He'd found out that long after he had                been born, our dad had continued a                relationship with his first wife Marcia                in secret.      BRIEF CUTAWAY to Chris hitching on the Montana highway.                 And that one lie had led to another.                That two years after Chris was born, dad                had had another son with Marcia. Worse                yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was                still legally married at the time. And                it was Chris and I who were the bastard                children.       Walt.                 Dad's arrogance made him conveniently                oblivious to the pain he caused. And                mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a                young mistress, became his accomplice.                                             39aA. She and my dad had decided to bend thetruth about this other child saying thatdad wasn't the father and they maintainedthat their fraudulent marriage was real.  Chris was quiet when he told me this. Hesaid it made his ""entire childhood seemlike a fiction""; that ""the truth had beendying everyday."" If something botheredChris, he'd usually keep it to himself.And he made me promise to do the same.                 He never did tell mom and dad that he               knew. But Chris measured himself and               those around him by an impossibly               rigorous moral code. He loathed what he               considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and               resented what they considered guidance.               Chris submitted to dad's authority               through college but I knew he raged               inwardly the whole time. It was               inevitable that Chris would rebel. And               when he did, he did it with               characteristic immoderation.     Walt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping, heartbroken     and ashamed on a quiet Annandale street in the shadowless     light of dusk.                My father is a brilliant man. But he had               made some terrible mistakes. And to some               extent, it seemed Chris was making him               pay an awful price.     The image of Walt DISSOLVES INTO...       A pick-up truck pulls over for Chris. As Chris jumps in,     we see on the passenger side door, the name WAYNE     WESTERBERG boldly painted across it. Chris hops in     beside a hyper kinetic man with thick shoulders and a     black goatee.                       (rolling a cigarette without                       moving forward with the                       truck, his knees rattling up                       and down)               How're you doing? Wayne Westerberg.                       (shaking hands)               Hi Wayne. Alex McCandless.                Seems like every time I come on this               road, there's somebody hitching out here               who looks as skinny and unfed as you.     Chris nods with a laugh.   Wayne continuing...                 Look, I gotta stop in Ethridge to drop               something off (know what I mean?)     Chris is not sure about the ""drop something off"" part.                How `bout you and I grab something to eat               down there?                Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you.                How long has it been since you've had               anything to eat?                Couple of days. I kinda ran out of               money.                Well, there's no choice about it.    I'm               gonna get you some dinner.     Wayne lights his cigarette, puts the truck in gear and     they head down the road.     As the sun dips behind the horizon we TILT UP off the     departing truck to the sky. Ominously mounting clouds     stunningly reflect the red rays of the hidden sun:       Wayne's truck cuts through a track in a wheat field     moving toward a compound of three trailers, one a double-     wide, the other two on wheels, smaller. Beside them, a     Wyeth-esque farmhouse. He eases the engine and comes to     a stop in front of the double-wide.     As he and Chris dismount the truck, Wayne gives him a     hushing finger across the lips. They tip-toe up to the     door, where Wayne shuffles a bunch of keys.     A little thunder kicking in the distant sky.        As Wayne and Chris enter, they tip-toe over empty booze      bottles and passed out work crew; Wayne's harvesting      team.      They make their way to a small table in the kitchenette.      Remains of the evening's dinner are on the stove. Wayne      turns on the stovetop coils to heat it up.                 So where is it you're headed?                 I was thinking about doubling back                through the Canadian side of Glacier                Park.                 Yeah, I used to have a girlfriend who'd                go there, camp on the Black Feet Res.                She was into all that American Indian                stuff.            I can bring you to the border at Sweet          Grass once you've had some food.           Well, that'd be great.   What do you do          out here?           Well, I do a lot of things. Computer          programming. Video game repair. I'm a          licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in          Carthage and another one a few miles out          of town. But in the summertime I run a          combine crew, follow the harvest from          Texas way the hell north to the Canadian          border. We just got done cutting barley          for Coors and Anheuser Busch. But then I          got this little black box deal on the          side (You know what I mean?)           You mean those free satellite TV deals?                  (as though he hadn't brought                  it up)          You said it, not me.Chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains.Wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heatedfood. As Chris starts digging in, a major gust of windrocks the trailer.                  (smiling, responding to wind) Chris doesn't respond, digs into the food. Points to theunconscious tribe splayed out. SIX GERMANIC-LOOKING            Who are these guys?Wayne gets a little giggle.           Those are my Hudderites. Agriculture's a          pretty transient business. These guys          come off the Hudderite colony looking for          work. I always got work for people.          Then that guy -                        (pointing at guy making most                       of his snore)               That's Kevin. He's with me most of the               time. He's not a Hudderite. He's from               Madison.                Madison.    Okay.     Just then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding     the trailer shell. A couple hits of lightning follow.                Listen, you don't want to go out there on               the road tonight. Why don't you just               roll your sleeping bag out and play like               a Hudderite until morning.     Chris looks about. There's not much room but it beats     the pelting outside.                Thanks Wayne. I will.      Chris, with a grin on his face, lays in his sleeping bag     between a Hudderite and the sleeping KEVIN. Wayne comes     from the back bedroom, tip-toes through the sleeping     bodies to hand Chris a pillow.                Get a good sleep. See you in the               morning.     Chris waves a thanks, puts the pillow beneath his head     and closes his eyes.        We are TIGHT on Chris' hand atop the shifter of one of     Wayne's lumbering harvesters.                 Okay. Now take hold of the joystick, get               the feel of header, idle it down with the               toggle switch...     As Chris makes the attempt, we immediately hear the     grinding of gears, the instrument alarms in chaos.     WIDE SHOT: Chris and Wayne sit atop a combine. In the     background we see Wayne's trailer and two other combines     piloted by Wayne's crew members on the ocean of ripe     blond grain.     Chris tries his hand at the shifter once more.   This time     the thing starts to move.                That's it. That's it. Now take it on               out and make yourself some money.     Wayne jumps off the combine and Chris begins to cut his     pattern, intermittently struggling with the shifter.     Wayne laughs his ass off.      SERIES OF SHOTS indicating a SERIES OF DAYS passing as     Chris gets a hang of the machines a little more at a     time.       Six men including Wayne and Chris, two among them -     Hudderites, crowd in to the small dinner area of the     trailer. Talking politics and bullshit, and eating a     welcome meal.                I'm gonna break out some whiskey. Alex,               you want anything other than that beer?                I'd take a White Russian if you've got               it.     The group of men laugh at the youngster's order of a     fancy drink.                  What are you Alex, a Commie?                 No, I just like White Russians.                 I haven't got anything like that here.                But I tell ya what. And I know I speak                for everybody. You wanna come work with                us in Carthage, we'll hook you up on the                grain elevator and get you a White                Russian down at the Cabaret.                 Really?                 Dawn tomorrow, engines roaring.                       (to the others like a mock                        blues singer)                ""Pot o Gold. Oh that pot o gold.""      They all join in to the chant/song:                 ""Pot o Gold.    Gotta get that pot o gold!""                        (raising his beer)                To Carthage.                        (toasting)                To Carthage.         MAGIC HOUR. TELEPHOTO LENS. The harvesting convoy rolls      toward us like a herd of mammoths.        A series of silent, quaint establishing tableaus.      (Director's Note:    Condor above street)      It's a sleepy little town. Population: 274. Cluster of      clapboard houses, tiny yards, and weathered brick      storefronts rising humbly from the immensity of the      northern plains. Stately rows of cottonwoods shade a      grid of streets, seldom disturbed by moving vehicles.      From UNDER CAMERA, the series of tableaus is interrupted      as the convoy roars into our frame from BENEATH CAMERA.        In the passenger seat, Chris is glowing at his new      surroundings. Wayne picks up the CB radio.                 Okay Kevin, get all the machines back to                the elevator. I'm gonna show Chris to                his room.                        (over CB)                I've got dibs on that shower, that                shower's all me.                        (laughs)                First come, first serve buddy.      Wayne signs off and veers off the road.        A two-story Victorian in the Queen Anne style. Wayne     veers his truck into the front yard, parking under the     big cottonwood that towers above.       Chris follows Wayne up the narrow stairwell.                        (carrying Chris' pack for                       him)               Come on up in here. This'll be your room               for as long as you hang about.     Wayne opens the door at the top of the stairs.      Wayne plops Chris' pack beside a single bed in the tiny     but comfortable room. Chris enters, very happy with his     new quarters.                Shower's down the hall. If you hurry you               can beat the rest of the boys to it. But               you do want to grab a shower cause we're               all heading over to the Cabaret in               exactly thirty-six minutes. So, get your               dancing shoes on. There's foo-foo in the               medicine cabinet. I think it's Brut.                      (slaps his own face as if                       he's putting on cologne)               Then you want to put your charm in               overdrive cause we like to PAH-TAY!     Wayne gives Chris a wink and exits, shutting the door     behind him.     Chris takes in his new surroundings. He's on a work crew     and he likes it. Chris makes the move for the shower but     by the time he opens his door to the hall, all the other     crew members are barreling up the stairs in front of     them, clamoring for dibs (Chris' POV)                I got first!                       (in a kid voice)               You had first last night!                       (entering the bathroom)               Well, if you wanna wash my back,               cowboy...                You go ahead, fairy.    Just don't use all               the soap.      ANGLE: Chris. He gets a kick out of these guys.    He     closes the door.       The Jack Daniels is flowing. Wayne's crew drinks,     smokes, and strikes out with every fat woman in the     place. GAIL BORAH, an on-again, off-again girlfriend of     Wayne's tends bar. A petite sad-eyed woman, slight as a     heron, delicate features and long blond hair. Wayne and     Chris sit at the end of the bar.                Alex, this is Gail . This is the one to               go to for that White Russian you've been               wanting. Of course the quid pro quo can               be hazardous.                Shut up, Wayne.                      (to Chris)               You want a White Russian, sweetie?                       (shyly)               Yes please, ma'am.                Yes please, ma'am?     Wayne slaps Chris on the back.                Ain't he great?                       (to Chris)               Don't pay any attention to him.     With that Wayne reaches over the bar, grabs Gail and     gets her in a lip-lock, to which she ultimately gives in.       Wayne and Chris are both drunk.            Anything to do with hunting, preserving          the meat, smoking it or whatever, you          talk to Kevin over there. That's your          man.ANGLE: KEVIN.   He looks every bit the Grizzly Adams part.           Outdoors-man. What's the interest in all          that?           I'm thinking about going to Alaska.           Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?     The          city Alaska does have markets.                  (with a drunken, excited                  energy)          No, Alaska, Alaska. I want to be all the          way out there. On my own. No map. No          watch. No axe. Just out there. Big          mountains, rivers, sky. Game. Just be          out there in it. In the wild.           In the wild.           Yeah. Maybe write a book about my          travels. About getting out of this sick          society.                  (coughing)          Society, right.           Because you know what I don't understand?          I don't understand why, why people are so          bad to each other, so often. It just          doesn't make any sense to me. Judgement.          Control. All that.           Who ""people"" we talking about?           You know, parents and hypocrites.          Politicians and pricks.      Chris is clearly troubled by his own words.      Wayne leans     into Chris.                         (tapping a long finger                         against Chris' forehead)                 This is a mistake. It's a mistake to get                 too deep into that kind of stuff. Alex,                 you're a helluva young guy, but I promise                 you this: You're a young guy. Blood and                 fire! You're juggling blood and fire!                         (chimes in)                 Who are you to be giving advice to                 anybody?                  Blood and fire...What? Mr. Happy.                 That's who I am. Gimme a kiss.     Gail    pushes him off with mock disgust.                         (mock opening his zipper, in                         a high-pitched voice)                 Come on, give Mr. Happy a kiss!     On the television above the bar appears Reverend Jesse     Jackson. We can't hear him but we can see him. Chris     points at the television and yells out to the entire bar     of cowboys and ranch hands -                  Now, that's who could be President!     Wayne buries his face in his hands.       Chris is sacked out from his night of drinking when -      The door knocks blast into Chris' head. He awakens to     Wayne opening his bedroom door. Wayne, despite his own     drinking the night before, is wide awake and fresh as a     daisy.                 Workin' time!       All the boys are hard at it, including Chris and Wayne.     Wayne moves to Chris' side.                So, what do you think about all this?               (The working life)                I like all this.       While Wayne and most of the crew get a little rest in the     shade of the grain elevator and eat their lunches, Chris     and Kevin are deep in a bald patch in the field.     Kevin is taking Chris through the paces of smoking and     curing meat in the wilds. Chris listens and takes notes.     (Director's note: Cast a ""Kevin"" who knows this shit and     shoot it as a dialogue scene as well as a silent     tableau.)       The place is packed and Chris is taking over the piano,     surprising everyone with a tremendous talent. Segueing     from honky-tonk country to ragtime, he's become the life     of the party.     The MUSIC continues OVER:      All the men of Wayne's crew (who by now we've come to     know) and Chris are working their asses off.     POST LAP MUSIC FADES OUT as we: INTERCUT the crew at work with a SERIES OF MYSTERYANGLES: Tires kicking up dust on dirt roads, throughtown, and into the field behind the grain elevator. Backto the work, back to the tires. Back to the work, backto these several cars hauling ass through the field.Back to Wayne, up high in the grain elevator -                  (to Chris, as he lowers                  himself down the man-lift)          I gotta take a piss.Chris' POV: from high in the grain elevator. He watchesWayne below, as Wayne saunters out to the field to take apiss. With his back to us, Wayne whips it out and startspissing about 25 yards from the grain elevator.CU Wayne. He looks up from his urination, the grainelevator behind him. We see a slight mischievous smilecome to his face. He puts his hands up into the air whensuddenly -Six unmarked FBI vehicles surround him.(Director's note: Triangulate three long lenses on Wayneas the mysterious cars enter each frame, as they skid toa dusty stop on all sides of him.)Chris and the men of his crew look on.           I warned him about those little black          boxes.As Wayne is handcuffed and led away, he nods up to hisboys.                  (to arresting agent)          You wanna get that zipper for me?                 (and then calling out to his                  crew)          Sorry boys. Gonna have to shut down for          a while. Alex! You come back and work          for me anytime.                 (to Chris and the men)          Gail's got all your checks, guys. I          shouldn't be away too long.With that, the FBI agents have hustled the good-naturedWayne into the back of one of the cars.      As they take off into the distance, we move in on Chris,     bemused.                       (pre-lap)               Where are you gonna go?       Chris sits at the end of the bar with Gail Borah.                I've been thinking a lot about Alaska.                Alaska? What kind of nut-nut are you?               Alex, it's October for Christ's sake.               You go to Alaska, you go in the Spring.               This time of year you wanna head south.               Personally, I like Las Vegas. One-armed               bandit. That's what I like.                Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to               Alaska, at least so I can get settled up               there in decent weather.                South. You want to go south. You want               me to take you out to the highway?                       (putting on his cowboy)               Little lady, I walked in, I can walk out.     He puts a few bills down on the bar, saddles up his     backpack, and gives Gail a hug.                You take care of yourself now, Alex. You               got a whole family here depending on it.                I will. Thanks Gail .   And tell Wayne,               I'll drop him a line.     He gives her a kiss on the cheek and he's off.       Empty Carthage streets but for Christopher Johnson     McCandless walking off as we CRANE UP.       Chris has hitched a ride with a long-haul trucker.     SERIES OF ANGLES: MUSIC OVER: Traveling shots.       Chris disembarks the long-haulers truck, waves a goodbye,     and the truck moves on.     SERIES OF ANGLES: Chris walking south through the desert     following the river bank. He covers twelve miles before     he arrives in an Arizona town, a dusty weigh-in station.      The town is quiet but along the storefront lane where     Chris walks, he comes upon a sporting goods store. In     the window, a fiberglass river kayak. Chris stares at     it.       We HEAR passing cars humming above. Chris has set up     camp and he's digging in the dirt. He buries many of his     belongings. He makes sure he's got his check from     working with Wayne in his pocket. He packs only the     essential items, burying all else. He gets into his     sleeping bag and goes to sleep.        Chris backpacks past the mushroom rock forms at the      entrance of Lee's Ferry.        Chris approaches the GREEN-SUITED FUNCTIONARY at the      front desk.                 Can I help you?                 Yeah. If I wanted to paddle down the                river, where's the best place to launch                out of?                 ""To launch out of?"" What's your                experience level?                 Not much.                 Any?   Do you have a permit?                 A permit for what?                 You can't paddle down the river without a                permit. If you like, you can apply for                one here, get yourself some experience,                and I'll put you on the wait-list.                 Wait-list?   To paddle down a river?                 That's right.                        (giggling)                Well, how long do you have to wait?                 I've got an opening May 2003.                        (laughing)               Twelve years?                Well, you could always join a commercial               raft trip and go with a licensed guide.               They usually have a few last minute               cancellations. I think it's about two-               thousand dollars.     Chris busts a gut.                Thanks for your help.     The Green Suit eyes Chris' departure with suspicion.       Chris stands beside a dramatic section of rapids.    The     whitewater roars.     As we SLOWLY ZOOM INTO Chris' face, terrified and     absorbed by the torrent, a bead of sweat drops across his     forehead, TILTS OUR CAMERA to his trembling hands and     legs, when Peter Gabriel's I Have The Touch begins to     play.      ZOOM INTO Chris' face...a decision:     Fear becomes determination     We SMASH CUT ON CUE with Peter Gabriel's vocals. SLO MO,     SUPER DRAMATIC - Chris blasting out of a shoot in the     rapids in the kayak we saw the night before. It's     outrageous. Hair-raising. Just like Peter Gabriel sings     it, he has the touch.     This kid's never kayaked before, certainly never on     rapids. But it's that immortal stage of life, no care,     no helmet, no life-jacket, pure adrenaline. He can     hardly believe he's surviving it as he goes but there's     no looking back now. And with every thump of the music,     we share his rush. His pure unadulterated exhilaration.     With the culmination of the music, Chris has successfully     shot the rapid. He paddles through quiet waters.      We move in on him as he maneuvers the kayak to face     upstream. There before him, the impossible rapid he had     just completed.                       (to himself)               I'm Superman. SuperTramp.     He feels immortal. He makes his about-face and is about     to head down stream when he sees at the river's edge, a     group of RIVER TOURISTS and their GUIDE lunching beside a     pontoon raft. The tourists look like a bunch of     bewildered tubby-troopers in their misfitted orange life-     vests and cereal bowl helmets. The RIVER GUIDE yells out     at Chris as Chris moves PAST CAMERA and away. The guide     gets on his satellite phone to alert the Rangers. We     ZOOM SLOWLY away from them toward the rapid.       Phillip Glass' Cloudscape plays OVER:   Chris paddles on.     LOW ANGLE: It is a narrow gorge of solid rock, looking up     from hundreds of feet below the canyon crest.       The canyon has widened to beach-like banks.   Music FADES.     Along the banks he sees a YOUNG BLONDE COUPLE. This is     MADS and SONJA, in their 20's, Danish. They play at the     river's edge beside their campsite, hotdogs cooking on a     Hibachi. Chris averts his eyes when Sonja rises from the     water, topless.                         (yelling out to Chris)               Hello!                Hello.                You can join us!     Chris doesn't know quite what to do. But Mads seems     quite comfortable inviting a stranger into the presence     of his topless girlfriend.            We have hotdogs!Chris - can't turn that down!   He paddles to within feetof the water's edge.           I am Mads.           Hi. Alex.           I am Sonja.Chris gives Sonja a little wave. She bypasses it, wadingup to the Kayak, giving him a big hug.           Hello Alex.This couple is extremely energetic. Can't wait toplease. And a bona fide American adventurer in theirmidst. It's everything they could've wanted.           We are from Copenhagen.   And you are from          the rapids.           I am.           My Got!           Crazy man. You're a crazy man!    Sonja,          he is a crazy man.                 (to Chris)          I'll make you a hotdog.Mads grabs a hotdog from the Hibachi.           Just one minute. One minute...Sonja has moved to the tent to put on a dry T-shirt. Butas she moves back to the water's edge, those nipples keepsaying Hello.Chris, meanwhile, simply cannot wipe the smile off hisface in the presence of these warm, open people.            I love this. Don't you love this? This          is nature. We see it in the American          movies. How come you're crazy?           Well...                  (interrupting)          Because that's crazy! You come down the          rapids. What do you want on your hotdog?          Mustard and relish?           You have ketchup?           No, I have mustard and relish.           Mustard and relish it is then.           Sonja, you want a hotdog?                  (in Danish)          Of course I want a hotdog.   Why are you          stupid?Mads plops two more hotdogs onto the grill.                  (translating)          She asked me why I'm stupid. And I say,          well...like I ask you why you're crazy          and you say ""well."" Where are you going?           I haven't decided.           We like it here very much. We went to          Los Angeles. And then, we went to Las          Vegas.           Las Vegas is very nice.   The universe is          very good.  And then, we come here.   Maybe you go toMexico.            You can take kayak around Lake Mead and          then take the river down to Mexico.Chris likes the idea.           How far are we from Lake Mead?           Sonja, how far is Hoover Dam?Sonja grabs a map from the tent, opens and scrutinizesit. We follow her finger tracing the river.           Maybe three hundred thirty          kilometers...like two hundred miles.Sonja walks the map over to Chris at water's edge andhands it to him. He studies it.           Man, I wonder if I could go all the way          down into the Gulf of California.Chris traces his finger along the impossibly long routeleading to El Golfo de Santa Clara.                  (entering the water with                  Chris' hotdog)          I go with you. We leave Sonja here.    You          and me in kayak - we go to Mexico.                  (in Danish)          You're embarrassing.   Idiot.Mads with a burst of re-exhilaration, grabs Chris' hand,shaking it violently.           I like the meeting you.           Thank you. I'm very happy to meet both          of you too.Sonja heads back for her hotdog taking her T-shirt off onthe move. Chris is about to bust a gut. Sonja returnsto her sunbathing. These two are a hoot. Just then, something catches Chris' attention upriver.We can just barely make out the SOUNDS of a jet boatmotor. His eyes narrow a bit, then -                 Well, guys I really appreciate the               hospitality but I wanna make camp down-               river a ways so I better take off before               dark.       Chris, back in the kayak is paddling down river. Mads     and Sonja on the bank, wave a boisterous goodbye. And     they just keep waving. And Chris keeps waving until he     has drifted out of sight, when around the upriver bend     arrive the RIVER PATROL.     At river's edge, Mads, thinking quickly, waves for their     attention. Pointing the river patrol back upriver, he     yells:                He went thattaway!   The crazy man - he               went thattaway!     And miraculously, the river patrol makes an about face     and heads in the opposite direction of Chris. Suddenly     Sonja thinks Mads is the most clever man on earth. As     she jumps his bones right there on the river's edge -                Just like in the movies.        Chris and the kayak are in the back of a pick-up truck     heading down river by road. We pass the Hoover Dam.                It would be Christmas in a couple of               months. And the last news we'd had was               about his car being found. I woke up a               couple of days ago, and for the first               time, I was surprised to realize that it               wasn't only my parents who hadn't heard               from Chris. I wondered why he hadn't               tried to call in case I might answer. He               could've hung up if it wasn't me.      Chris is re-stocked on some food items which he packs in     his bag and shoves into the bow of the kayak. This lower     stretch of the river has little in common with the     unbridled torrent that explodes through the Grand Canyon.     Emasculated by dams and diversion canals, the lower     Colorado burbles indolently from reservoir to reservoir,     through some of the hottest, starkest, most austere     country on the continent.                  But why he didn't send a letter, maybe                through a friend. I got mad. But I told                myself it was good. It made me remember                that there was something more than                rebellion, more than anger that was                driving him. Chris had always been                driven, had always been an adventurer.                When he was four years old...       Chris at age four.                 ...he once wandered six blocks away from                home at three o'clock in the morning.       Four-year old Chris opening a kitchen drawer.                 He was found in a neighbor's kitchen, up                on a chair, digging into their candy                drawer.       As Chris paddles downstream with Mexico in his sights, he      is stirred by the saline beauty and the clean slant of      light.      (Director's Note: ANGLE over Chris ONTO water reflecting      the landscape and diamond flashes of sunlight.)                 Whatever drawer he was opening now must                have something sweet in it.        Chris floats in SLO-MO through the air, his hair wisping      skyward.      As he pierces feet first, a clear blue surface of the     river's water, CAMERA goes UNDERWATER with him and     follows him in CU as he surfaces, jubilant in the beauty     of the Topock gorge. He shakes the water out of his     hair.        Chris continuing down river through the Imperial National      Wildlife Refuge, drifting past saguaros and alkali flats.        Chris, on a day hike, the river behind him, he (TELEFOTO      LENS played in beautific BACK LIGHT) tracks a herd of      wild horses.      ANGLE: Chris: The herd moves in an S-pattern. Chris runs      beside them and in our LONG LENS PERSPECTIVE, he seems to      be among them.        Chris sits outside his tent, beside a campfire scrawling      a letter. His ""bought-food"" bounty in evidence.      The words APPEAR ON SCREEN in his handwriting OVER THE         CONTINUE letter OVER:       Chris moves up the steps of the post office with an      enveloped letter in hand.      CONTINUE letter OVER:        Chris is in the elegant, 1930's-style post office buying      a stamp.      CONTINUE letter OVER:       Chris licks the stamp.      Continue letter on screen:       The stamp comes down onto an envelope addressed:            Chris ports his kayak over the dunes, snaking a scar      through the sand in his wake. Mexico in his sights.      POV: Morelos Dam at the Mexican border.       Careful not to be seen, Chris shoves off, just upriver      from the dam/border.      The floodgates are open just enough to allow Chris to lay      back in the kayak and drift prone under the gate. He      sits back up and paddles through having passed the      border, either unnoticed or ignored by patrols.       A television set with George Bush plays.   SOUNDS of     typewriters.                Why'd you go to Mexico?                I thought I'd run the whole river into               the Sea of Cortez. The stupid dams dried               it up.        Chris is kayaking.   He dead ends in a reeded tributary.                   How long were you on your own down there?                 36 days.                 How'd you know?                 Fingers and toes.      We see Chris' fingers and toes.   (DOWN ANGLE into      interrogation room)                 After the river dried up, I ported the                kayak and got a lift to Golfo.       We see Chris jump down off the back of the duck hunter's      truck. He slides the kayak off the truck bed onto the      street. Chris goes into his pocket, pulls out a sealed      sandwich bag of cash. He tries to pay the hunters for      their time but they refuse the money. Nonetheless, Chris      is insistent and they relent.      Chris pulls his backpack from inside the bow and saddles      it up on his shoulders. The hunters pull away.        (1000mm lens) LOW ANGLE: SAND AND HEAT WAVES IN      FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND: Chris, paddling his kayak      toward us, seemingly in the sand dunes. As we BOOM UP      SLIGHTLY, we see that there is a bend in the water's edge      and that he is in fact, paddling in the crystalline blue      of the Gulf.                 I paddled south about 20 miles.       UNDER-WATER SHOT: We are directly UNDER the passing kayak      as it slices the water's surface above us. We BACKFLIP      the CAMERA as it passes.                 That's when I saw the cave and everything                went upside down.        See the ocean and sand, wind whipping them. CAMERA PULLS      BACK to reveal Chris in a cave where he has made camp;      watching, waiting.                 A sandstorm hit and I was pretty much                stuck. My kayak blew away, so I left it                and walked up the beach, hitched back                north, and here I am.                  Chris sits with the IMMIGRATION OFFICER.                  36 days, wow. I guess they're gonna have                to watch that spillway a little better.                 What they ought to do is open up the dams                and let the rivers flow.                 I can't disagree with you on that. Okay,                Alexander SuperTramp. I think we're                gonna let you out of here shortly but                you've got two working weeks to get an ID                card in the United States. You can't be                crossing these borders without                identification, are we understood?                 Yes, sir. I've eaten enough sand to send                me back to the city anyway.        A freight train cranks up its great engines and starts      its move west.      Chris POV: We see a BULL (hobo slang for a railway      security guard) making his rounds. As the bull      disappears around the caboose, and the trains motion      picks up, Chris appears from behind a fuel pump. He      makes his move in the shadows to the passing freight      cars, not quite sure how to board them. He begins to      slowly jog beside the train. There is a vertical steel      rod on each passing car. He times the train by putting      his hand out and letting the vertical rods slap it.                        (counting)                One...Two...Three - And with that he accelerates to a run, throws his packinto the moving freight car before him, simultaneouslyleaping up to grab the rail and throw himself into thecar.       But his left foot misses and he's suddenly dangling from      the moving train. He grabs hand over hand on the rail.      ANGLE: Dangling feet and razor sharp wheels.      ANGLE: Chris. He puts everything into pulling himself      up, growling the strength into his muscles finally...       As Chris rolls forward into the car -- he made it!                 As Alexander Supertramp returns to                civilization...a hobo.                       (quietly)                I'm a for real hobo.      He's very happy about this (despite the near surrender of      it.) Chris uses his pack as a pillow, lays back on it and      begins to sing Roger Miller's King of the Road.        We TRACK with train by HELICOPTER as we SEGUE from Chris'      rendition of King of the Road to Roger Miller's. We let      the train get away from us and disappear.        Chris' train pulls into the yard. Bulls and loaders      greet the train. Chris jumps off and breaks for the      fence unseen.         The streets are crowded with business people on their way      to homes and happy hours, buses and parking garages,      showers and comforts. Among the throngs, we find Chris      walking up Grand Street, backpack on his shoulders. We      find he is not such an unusual sight, there are homeless      to the left and homeless to the right.        Chris walks in.       (Reminder: Condition of Mission is circa 1991)      Chris stands at the registration desk talking with a a                  Can you tell me how to get an ID card?            Did you lose your identification sir?           Yeah.           No birth certificate? Nothing?Chris shakes his head apologetically.           Ouch. Alright. Well you're gonna have          to work that out with the DMV. You can          catch them in the morning.The social worker begins to write an address on a pieceof paper.           The closest one is Montebello and we can          help you with a bus voucher.She hands the Montebello address to Chris.           So, just come to this desk when you need          the voucher.           And, if I want to apply for a job          somewhere, can you help me with that?           If you know how to cook, we might have a          space for you in our mobile kitchen. But          I'll have to talk to my supervisor about          it in the morning.           Alright then. Thank you. Oh, one last          thing. Do you have a bed for me?                  (handing him a form)          Sure. Just fill this in and I'll get you          all set up.Chris begins filling in the form.        Throughout the next two scenes, there is steady HONKING      of CAR HORNS, WAILING of POLICE SIRENS, AMBIENT HOSTILE      BANTER, GRINDING ENGINES OF BUSES, puffs of diesel      exhaust choke us.      300 HOMELESS occupy nearly as many beds in the dorm.      Chris searches the locker wall for his assigned locker.      When he comes upon it, he double checks the number with      that on the key, opens it, and puts his backpack inside.      CU: The lock, as Chris closes and secures his locker.        Chris walking among the hordes of homeless at 6th and      Wall streets. Open fires burn in front of cardboard      shacks. There are blacks, whites, Mexicans, even      families with children, junkies, winos, hustlers, and      hookers.        NEW ANGLE: Chris walking down Broadway. This is clearly      just blocks away from where we last saw him, yet the      atmosphere is as if of a different world. One of those      downtown LA hip yuppie blocks. He comes upon a bar.      Through the window Chris sees young men and women roughly      his own age - working people, suits, gold-chainers.      Metallica blares on the sound system.        Same CU on locker as before, but this time it's being      opened.        We don't even see Chris but the camera is his POV as he      passes the social worker (same as before) The social      worker catches a thrown key.                  You leaving us so soon? I know them DMV                lines are long...        (Director's Note: Traffic and pedestrians move in an      accelerated speed while Chris moves nearly in slo-      motion.)      Chris exits the building into CU.   He looks left, then      right, then directly into camera.          Chris' train barrels along.       Chris goes into his pack, grabs his canteen and drinks      some water. Mid-sip, the train begins to make a      surprising stop. Screeching wheels on track. Chris is      alarmed. As he moves to peer out the door, even before      he has a chance to see what's coming -- WHAM! He's      smashed in the head with a baton. A BULL jumps into the      car with him.                 Lay down on your stomach, spread eagle!       Chris turns to reason with the man. And that's all it      takes -- six straight blows to the ribs, legs, and arms.      We hear it more than we see it. Chris is in agony.                 Let me see your face.      The bull shines a flashlight into Chris' eyes.                 I never, ever, ever forget a face. If I                see yours again, I won't arrest you.                I'll kill you. This is the god-damned                railroad. And we will do whatever we                have to, to keep you freeloaders from                violating our liability.      Chris is trying to understand what the man is saying.                 If one of you people gets hurt on our                train, we are liable. Do you understand                that?                        (despite the violent irony)                I'm sorry, sir.                 You have I.D.?                 No, sir.                 Of course you don't.        Chris is pushed off the train, his pack thrown out after      him. The bull jumps down beside the track as well and      walks down track away from Chris, signalling an ""all      clear"" with his flashlight to some unseen engineer.                        (to Chris over his shoulder)                Last time, my friend.       Chris stumbles to his feet. The pain of the beating is      real. He bleeds from the back of his ear. But he can      walk. And he does.        Chris sits on his pack on the roadside, hitchhiking and      eating from a can of beans he opened with his      pocketknife. The odd car passes but doesn't stop.        Chris hops out of a Camaro that gave him a ride.   The      lighting is anonymous and so is the driver.                 Thanks very much.      He closes the door and the car drives off. We follow      Chris as he goes to the overpass edge. He drops his pack      over the side. Chris climbs down the edge of the      overpass, grabs his pack, and scurries into the UNDERPASS      below. (We suddenly recognize this as his pre-river run      campsite)      He digs up his buried belongings, returning them to his      pack. Last to come out of the ground, Chris' copy of      Jack London's Call of the Wild. He pulls off a temp      wrapping and dusts it off.      Chris lights his candle lantern and begins to read.      O.S. VOICES from the PAST:                        (screaming, angry)                I'm not talking about this anymore!      Feet stomping off.                 Don't walk away from me WOMAN!                 Fuck you!   I hate you!      Sounds of scuffle.         ELEVEN-YEAR OLD CARINE sits in the stairwell leading to      her parent's room where an argument ensues. Carine's      head in her hands, a delicate tear moistens the webs      between her small fingers.       FIFTEEN-YEAR OLD CHRIS enters from O.S. He leans against      the stairwell and looks up the stairs. Our focus remains      on Carine. In the B.G. SOFT FOCUS, Walt is pinning      Billie down onto the bed. She flails at him but he holds      down her shoulders.       Billie slips his grasp. Walt reaches out with a hit/push      of her back. She is thrust out of the bedroom onto the      landing above the staircase followed by Walt who      positions himself in the doorway like a hostile      crucifixion.                        (raging)                I'll just cancel Christmas then!      Billie returns to him, punching on his chest:                 Who do you think you are?   God?                 Yes.   I'm God!      Chris puts his hand out to Carine. She looks up to him.      He gives her a smile and a wink. She takes his hand and      they exit frame as the argument continues.                 Where do you kids think you're going?                        (not in desperation so much                        as a demand for their                        witness)                Kids, get back here!      We HEAR a DOOR SLAM OC.        The young Chris and Carine. She sits atop the handlebars      of his bicycle beaming as Chris peddles her down the      middle of the street. We PULL THEM as they ride.                          79aA.        (mockingly)I'll cancel Christmas!         (humored out of her sadness)Who do you think you are? God? Yes.   I'm God.        As they both laugh we DISSOLVE BACK to Chris (PRESENT)      reading beside his candle lantern.                 In the nine months since Chris'                disappearance, my parents went through                enormous changes. Guilt was giving way                to pain. And pain seemed to bring them                closer. My father had humbled                dramatically. And what had always been a                sort of curt arrogance, the kind of man                who actually thought he could cancel                Christmas, had given way to the                vulnerability of a father's heart. Even                their faces had changed. It made me sad                that I couldn't share with Chris the new                closeness I felt toward our parents.      The image of Chris reading begins a SLOW DISSOLVE INTO...                  I close my eyes at night sometimes and                imagine where Chris might be.      Suspicious, ghostly faces briefly appear in the strobing      lights that hit the train car from outside. They're      toothless and tattooed. Aged and young. Punks and      piercings. They're train tramps.      We see Chris observing them.   Warmly he speaks but we DO      NOT HEAR, ""I'm Alex.""                  Was there beauty around him?   Was he                hurt? Was he alone?      We see Chris sharing camp with the train tramps in the      outskirts of Las Vegas. DISSOLVE...                   Was he having the great adventure that he                wanted?      We see Chris working as a waiter in a Las Vegas      restaurant. DISSOLVE...                   Could he feel the changes here at home?                By some kind of supernatural osmosis?                Chris once wrote to me from college                saying he wanted to talk to me about all                the problems he had with mom and dad.      We see what may be Chris' POV from a train car snaking      through a mountain pass.                   He said I was the only person in the                world who could've possibly understood                what he had to say.      We see Chris in the Las Vegas desert by a campfire at      night.        HIGH ANGLE CU: We see Chris walking the streets of      Seattle. As we WIDEN OUT, he becomes a dot in the      Seattle landscape.                 In those silent moments, with my eyes                closed trying to picture where Chris                might be at that very moment, probably                climbing some scary mountain, I want to                reach into that picture and bring him                back to see what mom and dad, what our                family might become.      LONG LENS: Chris disappears over the rise into the      Seattle marketplace overlooking Puget Sound (per location      photography.)                   But instead when I open my eyes, what I                see is my mother, sitting at the dining                room table, sifting through photo albums                and pictures of Chris. It's all she can                do to examine the snapshots. And, though                she breaks down from time to time, she                studies them with a sort of hungry                intensity - like looking at food you                can't eat, or into a window at a family                around a table that you were once a part                of and can be no more.      We see Billie driving out of the Annandale supermarket      onto the boulevard. She sees a hitchhiker roadside. She      cranes her head - is it Chris? It's not.                 She convinces herself it's   Chris; that                it's her son, whenever she   passes a                stray. And I fear for the    mother in                her...        We see Chris hitchhiking in a barren desert.                 Instincts that seem to sense the threat                of a loss so huge and irreparable that                the mind balks at taking its measure - I                begin to wonder if I do understand what                Chris is saying any longer. But I catch                myself in doubt and remember that these                are not the parents he grew up with.                That in the forced reflection that comes                with loss, indeed everything Chris is                saying, has to be said. And I trust for                him that everything he is doing has to be                done. This is our life.        Chris is in the passenger seat of a Mac truck cab. Both      Chris and the TRUCKER look outward as though to find an      address or landmark.                 I don't know where to drop you.                Bullhead's kinda haphazard - there's no                ""center."" You sure you don't want to be                in Laughlin? It's casinos versus                chiropractors.                 Yeah, no.   This is good.   Right here.                 Alright then. Chiropractors it is.      He pulls over. Chris grabs his pack and exits the truck      in front of a laundromat. As the truck pulls away, Chris      sees a ""Help Wanted"" sign for Burger King on the      laundromat window.        The place is packed with a line out the door. LORI, the      second assistant manager, hurries back into the kitchen,      where we find Chris in paper cap, bunning whoppers at a      leisurely pace.                 Chris, you gotta go faster.   We've got a                line out the door.                         (a bit oblivious)                Okay.      But then just continues on at his leisurely daydreaming      pace. Lori is about to say something but by now she      knows there's no getting through to him. She looks down      to the floor where we see that Chris wears no socks.                        (extending patience)                Chris, I don't mean to be on you about                everything. You're doing a great job.                  I want to keep you on. And we all want                to help you get to Alaska, but you've got                to start wearing socks.                 Right, right. I forgot.                 And please.   Hurry.   We're ten deep.                 Okay.      But the pace remains.        Chris stands at the counter making a deposit with a YOUNG                  How much do I have in the account now?                 It looks like...let me see. Including                this latest deposit...One thousand, two                hundred and fifty two dollars                and...twenty-two cents.                 What's the interest on twenty-two cents?      The young teller giggles.        We're TIGHT ON Chris' sock-less feet, pedalling away from      the bank on a bicycle. The growing independence of his      financial situation felt in the MUSIC OVER:      SERIES OF ANGLES as Chris rides out of town, into the      desert, from a late afternoon sun into a sunset as he      arrives at his -       The casino lights of Laughlin, Nevada distantly in B.G.       Chris pedals up a dirt path to find many of his      belongings strewn about. And in particular, some food      supplies have been torn into. A coyote yips in the      distance as Chris finds his old straw hat torn to shreds.      Across the desert, scurrying away beyond the tumbleweed,      three young coyotes head for the hills. Chris picks up      his tattered hat and smiles.        We are TIGHT on the PUNCHCLOCK as Chris' timecard comes      into frame and is punched out.      WIDEN OUT to see Chris taking off his paper hat and      Burger King overshirt.      He walks his timecard over to Lori.   The place is all but      empty.                 Lori, I'm punching out.                 Okay.   Just put it in the drop.                 No, I mean I'm punching out for good.                        (happy for him)                We've made our quota, have we?                 Yeah. Also, I've got to do some things                before I head north.                 Alright Chris. Well, we've enjoyed                knowing you. I won't be able to get that                last check to you right away though.                 That's okay.    I'll let you know where to                send it.                 Alright then Chris.    Bye-bye now.                     Bye-bye.        City crews string Christmas lights and ornaments along      the main drag. We CRANE DOWN to find Chris' bike leaning      on a lamppost. A cardboard sign attached to it reads -          Chris is hitching south on the 95 into the Big Maria      Mountains. Beyond him we see a sign for Niland 206      miles.          Chris gets a clean shave and a whore's bath.      CU: Chris      Music FADES.        This is the vista of former barracks foundations Rainey      and Jan Burres had told Chris about. Hundreds of people      in tents and trailers, a quarter inch to the right of a      Rainbow Gathering as hillbillies and renegades mix with      the hippies. There are canvas-covered booths set up for      swap and trade. Even a few makeshift food stands.       We SEE that many of the inhabitants have set up CHRISTMAS      TREES outside their trailers and tents. Kids play naked      in a mud pool.        We see Rainey selling their wares. Beside the booth,      their van with its backseat door open. A little dog,      Sunni, jumps out the van door, sniffing something out.      Jan exits the van after the dog.                 Sunni!    Come here boy.      But Sunni has sniffed out Chris' large backpack leaning      against the rear of the van. Jan is just beginning to      recognize it, when from behind the van appears Chris,      looking like a million bucks.                 Surprise!                          (overjoyed)                Alex!      As she goes to hug him -      ANGLE: Rainey hearing his name, jumps up from his stool      to join them.      Big embraces all around.        An impromptu campfire celebration with live music from a      makeshift stage. Jan, Rainey, and Chris sit on chairs      outside the circle of inhabitants, taking in the music.                 You have to tell us everything.      (Note: This scene should largely be improvised. They all      know their characters, their history. Jan and Rainey are      doing great. And while Chris is intermittently aware      that the eyes of a pretty 16-year old girl are upon him,      Chris lays out his travels and his PLAN FOR ALASKA.       Jan remarks, ""I guess if you can figure out how to paddle      a canoe down to Mexico, hop freight trains, and score      beds at inner-city missions, you can figure out Alaska      too."")      At this point, the PRETTY 16-YEAR OLD GIRL who had had      her eyes on Chris, takes the stage with an acoustic      guitar, introduces herself as TRACY, then SINGS an              *      innocent love song of her own composition, stealing      seductive glances at Chris throughout the performance.                 I think you've made yourself a friend.                        (blushing)                She's only a teenager.                 Good luck.      The girl finishes her song.        Chris and Rainey man the second-hand goods booth while      Jan bathes Sunni in a steel bucket by the van. Among the      goods, a USED ORGAN. Chris is thrilled to have access to      all the second-hand books that are part of Rainey and      Jan's inventory. As he skims through Jack London's      Odyssey of the North, Rainey notices Tracy sitting on the       *      steps of her vagabond parents' rig across from the booth.      She picks silently at her guitar with her bright eyes      fixed on Chris.                 How long can you stay with us?                 Well, I'm waiting on a check from my last                job to come into Salton City the day                after Christmas. I've got to start                thinking about getting ready for Alaska.                When the sun gets a little lower tonight,                I'm going to start a calisthenics                routine. I think after the check comes                in, I'll try to find some mountains I can                climb everyday till spring comes. I                gotta see how far the money's gonna go.            I'm going to have to pick up a lot of          supplies before spring. So, I might take          another job or I might be okay.           Well, you know, we'll give you a little          something for every day you work the          booth.           I'm not taking any money from you,          Rainey.   It's been a real great twist          meeting you two. You look like you're          doing good.           We are, and you were a big part of that,          coming along when you did. Yep, things          are good.                 (gives a little giggle)          Man, I used to think Tantric sex was just          a bunch of reading. Speaking of which,          don't you think you ought to introduce          yourself to Joni Mitchell over there?Chris looks up from his book to the wide open 16-year oldsmile of Tracy. Rainey laughs aloud. Chris smiles back,      *and against his better instincts, gives her a little wave-over with the paperback. Tracy jumps off her step,           *putting her guitar inside the rig, and trots like alittle wood nymph to Chris.           Hi.           Hi.           You selling books?           I am.   We are.           I read a lot.           Do you?           Yeah.                  That's good.    I heard you play your song                last night.                        (embarrassed)                I'm terrible.      Rainey amused by all of this.                 You are not terrible.                 I'm not?                 No.   You sing sweet.                 Thank you. I was going to go watch the                kids play in the mud. Do you want to go?                 Go on.   I'll watch the store.                 I'm sorry.   This is Rainey.   And I'm                Chris.      Whoops, a slip on the name, but...                 Hi. Rainey. And this is Alex. (""Don't                lie to her."")                 I'm Tracy.                                            *      Chris realizes his slip but before Rainey can question      anything, Chris stands and goes off with Tracy.                 *      Rainey and Jan share a conspiratorial smile.       (Salvation Mountain?) (Leonard?)       LONG LENS: We watch Chris and Tracy sit pit-side with a         *      foreground of frolicking naked children splashing about      in the mud. We don't hear their conversation. We just      watch its gentleness.        Tracy helps Rainey cook dinner on the barbecue, meaning         *      to demonstrate to Chris what a wonderful wife she would      be. Jan and Chris sipping on beers sit beside each other      on folding chairs, out of Rainey and Tracy's earshot.           *                 I wasn't much older than Tracy when I got             *                pregnant. And I thought my husband and I                were going to invent peace on earth and                stay together forever. But it didn't                work out that way. He left. History.                Now ancient history. And that was the                end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself                - that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And                that was really good for a while. But                Reno was already a teenager and was                becoming a man in his own way. And then,                I don't know. He kinda followed in his                father's footsteps - out the door and                gone. And I really don't know where he                is. I haven't heard from him in two                years.                 I hope I get to meet him sometime.      Jan looks into Chris' eyes and smiles with pure love.      She leans over and gently kisses Chris on the cheek.                 Do your folks know where you are?      Chris aims to deflect the question as Tracy enters the          *      scene.                 Soup's on. Oh, I'm sorry.   Are you guys                getting heavy?                   No, sweetheart. Just hungry. You've                 been doing a fantastic job over there.                        (to Chris)                 Shall we eat?                  Yeah.      Tracy grabs Chris' hand and proudly leads him to supper.         *      As they exit frame, we remain for a moment with Jan and      her thoughts.          1. Chris reading and selling books.      2. Chris and Tracy taking walks with Sunni.                      *      3. Rainey and Jan stealing some afternoon delight in the      van. (It's the days of wine and roses)      4. Chris' new daily regimen of calisthenics.      5. Tracy's new daily regimen of watching Chris do                *      calisthenics. His lean body tighter and stronger      everyday.        Rainey stands over Chris as Chris does sit-ups.     Rainey's      gut hanging a little heavy over his belt.      OS VOICES exchange Christmas greetings.                  I really ought to get myself doing that.                  You should Rainey. Makes that Tantric                 stuff go even better.            How the hell would you know? That poor          girl over there is about ready to vault          onto a fence post. And here you are, the          monk of Jack LaLane.They share a laugh. Chris comes to the end of his sit-ups. Wipes his brow with a towel. Rainey squats downnext to him.           I guess Jan filled you in. About Reno          and everything. Children can be harsh          judges when it comes to their parents.          They don't grant clemency easily. I          think Reno tended to see things in black          and white. I just hope he lives long          enough to forgive her.The connection is not lost on Chris.           But painful as it is, you turned a light          on in her and I'm grateful.           Me too.           For what?Chris doesn't answer. A kid rides by on a bright new BigWheel. Must be from the rich side of the commune.           Do your folks know where you are?           No.           Don't you think they ought to?           They should. But I can't. Not yet,          anyway. I got a sister though, Carine.          She's the most beautiful girl in the          world. But, it's all got to stay behind          me until I get where I'm going.           Alaska?                  Yeah, Rainey. Alaska.      Rainey won't intrude any further. He just nods. Chris      notices Tracy in the door of her parent's rig, stealthily       *      waving him over. Chris gives Rainey the ""Uh-oh"" look,      pulls on his T-shirt, and walks over to the rig. Tracy          *      has disappeared inside.        Chris pops his head in.                 Hello?    Merry Christmas?                 Come in here.      As Chris mounts the steps, he finds Tracy laying on the         *      bed inside, wearing a skimpy white girl's tank top and      underpants.                 Guess what.                          (deer in headlights)                What?                 My parents went into town.                 No!                 Yes, they did. They went to call my                grandma for Christmas.                 No, I mean, no, we can't do that.                 Why not?      Chris moves to sit on the edge of her bed.    Tracy sits up     *      beside him.                  How old are you?                 Eighteen.      Chris throws her a look of doubt.                 Seventeen.                 What year were you born?      As soon as she has to think about it, the jig is up.                 You want to do something together?      Shyly, she shakes her head ""yes.""        We SEE the used Christmas trees of the residents being      thrown onto an existing campfire, building into the      enormous, celebratory bonfire that lights the scene.      As we did with the footsteps in the mud and the kayak      slashing the sand, we TRACK VERTICALLY along an extension      cord from one of the trailer generators to the stage      until we find -      Tracy with her guitar and Chris with the second-hand              *      organ from Rainey and Jan's booth on the stage. They      enter into a duet of John Prine's Angel from Montgomery      for the crowd of the Slabs' fire-lit inhabitants.      In the crowd, we find Rainey and Jan clapping and dancing      along to Chris and Tracy's song. Merry Christmas.                 *        Jan is pulling the van out from their plot.    Rainey is      guiding the single-directional vehicle.      Chris and Tracy stand beside the car path.    Chris writes        *      down Wayne Westerberg's Carthage address.                  You can always get in touch with me by                sending mail here. I don't know when                I'll get it, but I'll get it.                         (crying)                Okay.                 You're pretty magic.                 I am?      He hugs her.   And kisses her. (cheek, lips? I don't      know.)      Jan pulls up in the van. Rainey walks over to Chris and      gives him a paternal hug.                 You take care of yourself, kiddo.                 You too, Rainey. Thanks for everything.      Chris gives Rainey's gut a full-hand pinch.                 New Year's resolution?      Rainey gives him a wink and puts his arm around Tracy as        *      Chris jumps into the car. Then he and Jan hit the road.        This market/liquor store/post office serves as the      cultural nexus for the greater Salton Sea area.      As Jan's van pulls up opposite the post office and makes      a U-turn to curbside, Chris gets out of the van. Now      Jan's eyes really well up.                        (sweetly)                Just get your pack out of the back and                get out of here. I can't take a hug.       Chris says nothing. He just looks at Jan. They      understand each other. Chris closes the door. He      fiddles with the broken handle of the back door, gets it      open, gets his pack out. On top of his pack, A WRAPPED      XMAS GIFT and when he closes the back door, Jan heads      straight off back to the Slabs. Chris opens the      giftwrap; it's the new hat Jan had promised. Chris is      touched.        TELEPHOTO LENS: A long two-laned road before us rises and      falls in a series of saddles and peaks. The narrow      shoulders are densely wooded. SLOWLY APPEARING over the      near most peak, a TEAM OF EIGHT SHIRTLESS HIGH SCHOOL      RUNNERS. Leading the group - 17 YEAR-OLD CHRISTOPHER      MCCANDLESS. Lean, softly handsome, and graceful.                 In high school, Chris became captain of                the cross-country track team. They                called themselves the Road Warriors.      REVERSE ANGLE: The group of young runners, led by Chris      suddenly veer off the paved road into the adjoining      woods.       SERIES OF ANGLES: The runners, led by Chris, pace      unchartered trails, grassy hillsides, and shallow      streams.                 He'd take them on what he loved to refer                to as ""epic"" runs. The whole point was                to run until they were completely lost                and so exhausted that they were on the                verge of puking. Then they'd slow down a                little, somehow he'd find their bearings,                and lead them home again at full speed.                This was my brothers idea of fun.      We FAVOR Chris as he jogs in place at the exhilarating      point of being lost. When he has identified a most      likely return route, he quickens his pace, leading the      group in the direction of return.        Chris heads out with his last Burger King check in hand,      proudly wearing his new hat and in search of mountains to      climb.                 A year and a half into Chris'                disappearance, each day that goes by now                feels like two. Dad calls it ""suspended                animation."" I kept telling myself that                he had to get lost to prove his                independence to himself. But this was no                day run for the Road Warriors and after                so much time, I could no longer keep out                the haunting thoughts.       Chris, with pack and new hat walks away from camera      toward the interstate and the brittle mountains beyond.                 In many ways, my life and even my parents                had begun to move in new directions. I'd                fallen in love. And mom and dad had even                ventured out on a brief vacation. But,                when a search of tax records uncovered                Chris' contribution to OXFAM, the weight                of his disappearance just seemed to lie                down on us full length.        WIDE SHOT: We see the Oh My God Hot Springs. Steaming      pools lined with rocks and shaded by palm trees. A small      group of campers and Charlie Manson wannabes in       We ZOOM past them to the sheer rock faces and landforms      of the badlands, several miles beyond.        SLO MO: We are looking down a radically steep rock face.      A shirtless Chris is in training running towards us under      the hot desert sun.      We HEAR only breath and footsteps.        Chris rests on the sand under a tarp, hung from a      Creosote branch. A plate of beans and rice eaten nearly      clean and an empty water jug beside him. Flies buzz and      pick.        Chris on a morning jog, wearing a shoulder bag and      carrying an empty water jug. A quick wave to one of his      distant ""neighbors"" at the spring's camp as he runs by.        Chris continues his jog, cars whisk by and dust kicks      into the air. But Chris is undeterred, keeps running.       Chris approaches, slowing his jog to a walk. Chris sets      down his water jug and stretches his calves. In the      distance we see the peaks of the badlands landforms from      where he ran.       Chris shakes off the jog, picks up the jug, and we go      with him around the side of the building. There's a      water faucet dripping slowly into the desert mud. Chris      pops his jug under it and fills it up.        Chris walks the aisles, sipping from his jug, as he comes      across bags of rice on the market shelves. A HEAVY SET      GIRL passes him in the aisle with her well-mannered dog      following her.                        (no high-pitched pet voice)                Hey boy. You are a handsome fellow.                       (over shoulder to the girl)                Beautiful dog.                 Thank you.      As the girl continues on, the dog wants to stay with      Chris.                 Go on, boy.    Go on.      And the dog obeys him.      As he sorts through the various rice selections, brown,      white, wild, we notice a MAN peering over the opposite      shelf at Chris. This is RON FRANZ, between 70 and 80      years old, six-feet, thick arms, barrel chest, and large      ears. He wears old jeans, an immaculate white T-shirt, a      decorative tooled leather belt, white socks, and scuffed      black loafers. His deeply pitted nose demonstrates a      purple filigree of veins which unfold like an finely      wrought tattoo. And on either side of it, the wary blue      eyes of a soldier. He is the archetypical American man.      Chris has caught his sympathetic eye. Chris moves to the      counter to pay for rice.        In WIDE SHOT, we watch Chris from behind, walking out      across the two-lane road. He puts out his thumb to hitch      a ride.       When a truck comes from BEHIND INTO FRAME heading      straight for Chris, the truck makes a relaxed L-turn,      pulling up beside Chris.                  Where's your camp?                        (pointing)                Out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.                 I've lived in and around here six years                now and I've never heard of any place                that goes by that name.      Ron leans across the bench seat of the truck, opening up      the passenger door.                 Show me how to get there.      Chris hops in beside Ron, who extends his hand -                 Ron Franz.                 Alex.                 Alex.    Where are you from Alex?                 West Virginia.                 Okay, Alex from West Virginia. I like a                fellow who doesn't raise the pitch of his                voice when he talks to animals...shows he                doesn't condescend.      Chris remembers now the dog in the store and why Ron      must've thought to give him a ride.      And they head off.       Ron truck drives up the road.        As we come upon a 4x4 track twisting down a narrow wash -                 You go left here.      Ron turns the truck down the 4x4 track.       We watch the truck bump and grind on the mangled dirt      road about a mile in.      Out the window, Ron's eye has been caught by something.      Ron's POV: Oh-My-God Hot Springs -      We see a couple of day-glo vans and rusted out      Studebakers that hadn't been turned over since Eisenhower      was in the White House. Several of those living there      mill about buck naked. And at the center of the camp,      the steaming pools lined with rocks under the palm trees.                 You live here?                 No, we keep going. I'm further up.                Another half-mile or so, out on the                Bajada.       Ron and Chris drive up in the truck. Ron shuts off the      ignition and gets out of the truck to stretch his legs.      Chris follows, puts his full water jug under the tarp at      his campsite, hooking it onto a branch. He throws his      shoulder bag with the rice in it into his backpack.                 Well, this is somethin' out here. Don't                you worry about those dope smokers and                nudists down below there?                 No, they keep to themselves pretty much                and so do I.        (skeptical)Hmmm. You strike me as a bright youngman. Am I wrong about that? I think I got my head on my shoulderspretty good. That's what I mean.    How long have youbeen out here? Couple of weeks. And before that? A lot of places. I've been movingaround. How old are you? Twenty-three. Twenty-three years old! Son, don't youthink you should be getting an education?And a job? And making something of thislife? Look Mr. Franz. I think careers are atwentieth century invention and I don'twant one. You don't need to worry aboutme. I have a college education. I'm notdestitute. I'm living like this bychoice. In the dirt?        (laughs)Yeah, in the dirt. I just don't know.    Where's your family?            Don't have one anymore.           That's a shame.Chris can see some deep sadness in this man.           Hey, Mr. Franz. I want to show you          something.Ron follows Chris to the rockface we'd seen Chris runningearlier. They begin to walk up it. It's tough on theold-timer, walking this steep hill. But he's a tough old-timer, at least for the moment...ANGLE: The two men nearly half way to the summit.     It'sgetting steeper and higher. Ron stops.           This is getting a little steep.     And a          little high for me kid.           Alright.   But look out there. Even from          half way out, it's quite a sight isn't          it?Their POV: Enormous beautiful vista all the way acrossthe Bajada.           From the top you can see all the way to          the Salton Sea too.Ron looks up the precarious rock wall.   He ain't gonna beseeing the Salton Sea today.           You can see the Salton Sea from up there?           Yes, sir.                  (starting his way down the                  hill)          My goodness.           You don't want to go up?                    Nope.   I don't do these kind of things.      Chris smiles and follows Ron.       As they approach the      bottom of the hill -                   How about you and me take a drive? About                  fifty miles or so up highway, I know a                  place that's got a view, great food, and                  requires no climbing. How's that sound?      Chris thinks about it.     Then -                   Yeah, sure. It'll take me a couple of                  minutes to clean up.                   Fair enough.        Ron's truck drives through frame.       We see Ron and Chris driving parallel on the windmilled      road (Our frame will only hold the lower fraction of the      spinning windmills in the background)        VERTICAL POV: We are thousands of feet in the air over      the rigid rocky canyon as we ascend toward San Jacinto      summit. It's high. Scary HIGH.       MUSIC OVER: As Chris and Ron ride the tram to the peak,      we watch Chris watching Ron, his kind, moist old eyes,      slowly blinking at the wonder of the nature around him.      Other passengers on the tram seem nervous, but Ron is      meditative, almost hypnotized.       And with each roll-through of the tram through the cable      towers, the tram car rocks and sways, but Ron's peace      goes unbroken. And Chris continues to admire the gentle      blinking of his eyes.        The two of them sit in a quiet, corner   booth of the      tramway eatery that sits on the summit   of San Jacinto      overlooking the lights of Palm Springs   and the desert      clear back to Salton Sea. Chris is on    a roll.                 How old are you, Mr. Franz?                 Seventy-nine years old.                 Seventy-nine...see, all due respect, but                the real difference between people is the                quality of their soul and not on how long                they've trudged around like a dip-shit.      Ron laughs.                 But it's true.                 It is.   No question about that.      Ron continues to let Chris vent.                 The government's the same as my parents.                They don't respect anybody. Regulation.                Regulation. Regulation. WE can't do                this. But THEY can do that. I mean, the                hypocrisy of the whole...culture.   Makes                me crazy. My father was having children                *                with two women at the same time, and then              *                has the gall to think that he can be of                some guidance to me? Make judgments on                me? My mother, of course, goes along                with all of it. Keeps the secret, which                of course, makes my whole life a fiction.                Everything I thought was, wasn't.                They're such fools! Fucking idiots!                  Alex, please don't lump me in amongst                your judges. And your tyrants. But I'd                prefer to not hear that kind of language.                        (realizing his slip)                Sorry. I don't usually use that kind of                language either. I just get so angry                thinking about it.      Ron reaches across the table.    Puts his sturdy hand on      Chris' shoulder.                 You got a lot of passion, young man.      Chris smiles at Ron.        As Ron and Chris pull up in the pick-up truck, we see      SPORADIC FIREWORKS WHISTLING AND CRACKLING into the air      above the hot-springs, and HEAR the distant HOOTING of      its inhabitants. Chris hops out and walks around to      Ron's side of the truck.                 Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz.                Thank you.                 Look here. If Charles Manson and his                buddies don't kill me on my way out of                here, I'd like to cook you up a home                cooked meal tomorrow night. If I come                out here about, say, four o'clock                tomorrow, how would that be?                 That would be swell.      Ron is thrilled.                 Good, good. I'm no gourmet but I know                where the spices are. Good night, kid.                 Good night Mr. Franz.       And with that, Ron hits the road.        Chris hikes up it with his backpack on, one laborious      step at a time.        Chris summiting the rock formation. He looks down over      the desert and there before him, The Salton Sea.        The house is a single-level, beige structure, sitting      between the Salton Sea and a small inlet where he keeps a      fishing boat. Underneath a canopy in the backyard, there      is a small workshop of some kind.      HIGH ANGLE: Chris, looking at his own reflection in the      water below Ron's dock. In the reflection, we see his      hands full of dirty laundry.        Ron broils a couple of steaks. Chris enters and moves      past Ron carrying his laundry into another room.       Chris pours detergent over his long-in-need clothes.      Starts the cycle.       As Chris enters, Ron is pulling the steaks from the      broiler. Above the kitchen sink, Chris sees a row of approximatelyten photographs, each in vertical 4x6 frames, some blackand white, some color: all of Japanese boys and girls informal American and Japanese attire.           Did you find everything you need?                  (breaking his gaze from the                  photographs)          Yeah. I hope I don't wreck your machine.          There's a lot of grime in that stuff.           Well, that's what it's for.   How do these          steaks look?Ron pops the steaks on the kitchen table.           Great.           Well, sit down.Ron grabs some silverware from a drawer, plops it down onthe kitchen table with some paper napkins.           What do you drink?           You got a White Russian?           Nope.           Beer?           Nope. Don't have any alcohol. I had to          quit all that. How about a guava juice?           I'll take a guava juice, that sounds          good.As Ron gets the drinks -           Yeah, I had a little spell with the          bottle, you could say. Ron pops the drinks down on the table, then sits withChris. They lift their glasses toward one another, then -           Cheers.           I spent most of my life in the army. On          New Year's Eve 1957, I was stationed over          in Okinawa. My wife and son were here in          the States, just driving down the road          when a fellow who'd had too much to drink          plowed right into them. Killed them          both. Anyway, you might think that the          last thing in the world I'd do, is go to          the whiskey, but at the time, it felt          like the only thing I could do. And I          did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured          I wasn't doing my wife and son any good,          mourning them with a bottle. So, I          pulled myself together and quit drinking,          cold turkey. And then...Ron, spinning his body around, points to the photographsover the sink.                  (brightening)          You see all these kids over here?           Yeah, I was gonna ask you.           Yeah, that's...                 (pointing at each with his                  finger)          Fuki, Kenjiro, Yoshiko, Keiko, Masaro,          Junichi, Kimpei, Nayoko...For the last picture frame, Ron stands and takes it offthe shelf -                  (pridefully shows Chris the                  picture)          And this is Akira. Just finished medical          school.Chris takes the picture and studies Akira's face.   Ronsits back down.                  Yeah, I unofficially adopted all of them.                It did my heart some good but I guess                really it was just writing a few letters                and sending some money. Anyway, it was                important to me. I get a letter from                each of them from time to time. You                know. So, since all that, this is pretty                much me.                       (indicating his small                        reclusive abode)                 Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?                 No. I can't seem to get too far from my                leather. I'll show you after you finish                eating. I do a lot of leather engraving.                I got a little workshop in the garage.                Between that and my pension, I do pretty                well. But every time I think I might                take a trip somewhere, I get too far                behind on orders and such to consider it.                        (having wolfed down the                        steak)                Well, I'm finished eating. I'd love to                see your workshop.                 Would ya?      Chris nods.                        (standing)                Alright then.      Ron picks up the picture of Akira and replaces it on the      shelf above the sink.        As we begin, Ron is instructing Chris in the skills of      leather engraving.        Chris, a clear plastic bag of clean laundry beside him,      sits alone, cross-legged. He begins to carve into a      leather belt.        We follow Chris in a LOW ANGLE up his mountain run      framing from mid-back to just above his head, sweating      profusely.        Ron's truck cuts along the 4x4 track.        Chris reaching the summit.   He bends over to catch his      breath, hands on knees.                 How about some fishing?      Chris turns to the voice. And down at the bottom of the      rock wall beside the campsite, is Ron holding up two      fishing poles.                        (referring to the Sea)                That thing's twice as salty as the ocean.                Did you know that?      Chris has barely the breath to speak.                 Anything alive in it?      Ron shrugs his shoulders in a ""who cares?"" fashion.      Chris laughs but nods in the affirmative and gives Ron      the thumbs up.         1. Chris and Ron fishing in the Salton Sea. (no catch)      2. At Ron's workshop/garage, Ron guides Chris in his      leather belt project.      3. At Chris' campsite, Chris does push-ups while Ron sits      on the tailgate of his truck spying on the ""Manson      family"" through binoculars, shaking his head.      4. Chris at his campsite working on the belt by campfire      light. We MOVE IN on the belt, he's beginning to form      the letter N in the leather.      5. Chris jogging in the morning beside Oh-My-God Hot      Springs.      6. Chris and Ron at the leather bench in Ron's      workshop/garage.      In a EXTREME CLOSE-UP, MUSIC FADES OUT as we PAN across      Chris' leather belt and the story being told on it      through the engravings:       ALEX is inscribed at the belt's left end; then the      initials C.J.M. (for Christopher Johnson McCandless)      frame a skull and crossbones. Across the strip of      cowhide one sees a rendering of two-lane blacktop, a No U-      turn sign, a thunderstorm producing a flash flood that      engulfs a car, a hitchhiker's thumb, an eagle, the Sierra      Nevada, salmon cavorting in the Pacific Ocean, the      Pacific Coast Highway from Oregon to Washington, the      Rocky Mountains, Montana wheat fields, a South Dakota      rattlesnake, Westerberg's house in Carthage, the Colorado      River rapids, a canoe beached beside a tent, Las Vegas,      and at the buckle end, finally, the letter N.                 What's the N stand for?                 ...North.         Ron is sitting on his tailgate, watching Chris, backpack      on, climb the stone wall.                 Alaska?      Chris summits.                 Son, what the hell you running from?                        (yells down from above)                I could ask you the same question.                Except I already know the answer.                 You do, do you?                 I do, Mr. Franz. You've got to get back                out in the world. Get out of that lonely                house of yours, that little workshop,                and go live on the road.      Ron waves him off.                 Really. You're going to live a long                time, Ron. You should make a radical                change in your lifestyle. The core of                man's spirit comes with new experiences.                And there you are, stubborn old man,                sitting on your butt.                 Sittin' on my butt, huh?      Ron gets up off the tailgate.                 I'll show you sittin' on my butt.      And Ron starts making the old man hustle. Shifty      shoulders and all, up the stone wall.                   (mumbling)          ""Stubborn old man.""Chris is laughing and clapping.           Come on, old man! Come on!                  (mumbling)          Ya little pinhead.Chris is jumping up and down, thrilled for Ron's efforts.Now the old man's shuffle has turned into an old man'swalk. But he ain't stopping. And bit by bit he showshe's got it in him after all.As Ron is just about to mount the summit, Chris extends ahand. Ron swats it away.           Ya little pinhead.Ron drops down onto his back to catch his breath and lethis thumping heart slow down.           You alright?Ron, after taking one more deep breath, sits up and Chrissits next to him. He's actually pretty happy withhimself. He looks out and sees the distant Salton Sea.           I'm going to miss you when you go.           I'll miss you too, Ron. But you're wrong          if you think the joy of life comes          principally from human relationships.          God's placed it all around us. It's in          everything. In anything we can          experience. People just have to change          the way they think about those things.          You ought to put a little camper on the          back of your pick-up and go take a look          at some of the great work god's done out          here in the American west.           Alex...You're probably right.   And I'm          going to take stock of that.       Chris offers a skeptical glance.                 No, I am.      A second skeptical glance.   Which Ron squashes with      genuine sincerity.                         (almost to himself)                I am.      Chris buys it this time and feels he's accomplished      something with Ron.                 But I'll tell you something. The bits                and pieces I've put together, you know,                what you've told me about your family.                Your mother and dad. And I know you got                your problems with the church too, but                there's some kind of bigger thing that we                can all appreciate. And it sounds like                you don't mind calling it God. But when                you forgive, you love. And when you                love...God's light shines on you.      Miraculously, it is just at that moment that the cloud      clears from the sun and the light shines in Ron's eyes.      Chris points at Ron's face at the light shining on him -                 Holy Shit!                 I told you about that language.      The two men, their eyes welling up, fall back laughing.      EXTREME WIDE SHOT FROM BELOW: The two men on the summit      with the echoing of laughter and Ron's screams -                 I told you so! I told you so!        Chris pulls his laundry out of the dryer. He's got his      pack sitting in the doorway to the kitchen. He folds his      things and tucks them into his pack. Ron appears in the doorway dressed for travel.           What are you doing up?     It's three-thirty          in the morning.           Heard you get up off the couch half an          hour ago, and had a funny feeling you          might not be here for our breakfast.Chris says nothing.           I'm going to drive you a hundred miles to          somewhere where you can pick up a train,          a plane, or hitch a ride without getting          stuck on this desert. I'd take you all          the way to Alaska if I didn't have to get          to an eight o'clock mass.           Ron, you don't have to do that.           I want to do it.     Get you started on this          thing of yours.           On my Great -                  (interrupting)          I know. On your ""Great Alaskan          Adventure.""From just out of Chris' eye-line, Ron leans out of frame,picking up a zippered duffel bag. He opens it,displaying the contents to Chris.           There's a machete, an arctic parka,          collapsible fishing pole, and a few odds          and ends I threw in there for you.           Ron...           Oh, just take it.Chris does, nodding his thanks.                  I'll wait for you in the truck.        We follow the two men (on this nondescript locale)      driving along the highway east from dawn through sunrise.      They ride in silence through Coachchella Desert Center      and Blythe.        The truck exits at a North/South junction 95.       As Ron begins to pull over.                 Well my friend.                 Yep.      Both of them are uncomfortable. Chris goes for the door      handle. Ron's gnarled hand reaches out to take Chris'      elbow.      After a long beat, Ron speaks without looking at Chris.                 I had an idea. You know my mother was an                only child. So was my father. And I was                their only child. Now, with my own boy                gone, I'm the end of the line. When I'm                gone, my family will be finished. What                do you say, you let me adopt you. I                could be, say, your grandfather.      This takes Chris by surprise.   He knew it would be hard      but not this hard.                 How about we talk about this when I get                back from Alaska, Ron. Would that be                alright?       Silence.   Ron nods.   Releases Chris' elbow.                  Alright, Ron. We'll talk about it then.                          (trying to mask. The                          blinking, moist eyes again)                 Yep.   We can do that, yep.                  Thanks, Ron.      Ron nods. Chris gets out of the truck. Ron watches as      Chris saddles up his bag including the duffel that Ron      gave him.      Chris crosses the exit junction to where he can pick up a      ride north on the far side of the road.      We ZOOM SLOWLY through the windshield into Ron's face as      he watches Chris hitching away.      We HEAR the first bars of Neil Young's My My, Hey Hey.      This will carry throughout the following MONTAGE.        1. We ZOOM into Walt McCandless' face as he looks through      the Questar telescope that Chris had given him. ANGLE:      The stars through the telescope. The same stars his son      walks under...somewhere. We PAN ACROSS SPACE.      (Note: This montage will intercut Chris' traveling POV      with objective shots. However, we never SEE Chris.)      2. We PULL BACK from the starry night sky to see it      framed from within a moving train.      3. Carine in her shower, water cascades over her face.      4. Billie in her kitchen, making dinner.      5. Through the windshield of a semi-truck, the sun rises      on Glacier National Park.      6. A HANDHELD ZOOM-OUT from Canadian border crossing,      CAMERA TURNS to the woods beyond and MOVES INTO THEM. 7. SERIES OF TRAVELING SHOTS: (Through Skookumchuk andRadium Junction, Lake Louise to Prince George and DawsonCreek) STATIC NATURE SHOTS: HELICOPTER SHOTS8. On the bed in their van, Jan sits on Rainey's barefeet while he does sit-ups.9. Ron holding a garage sale, while hooking a trailer tohis truck.10. Wayne being released from jail.11.

(ThroughJohnson's Crossing, Whitehorse, and Beaver Creek.)22. From a passenger car window, a series of road signsreading: Closed for winter.                   About a month short of the second                anniversary of Chris' disappearance, I                had gotten engaged to my boyfriend Jerry                Ray and was moving in with him...      Carine, packing her belongings into boxes, stumbles upon      the Sharon Olds book Chris had given her on his      graduation day.                 ...when I stumbled upon the book Chris                had given me on his graduation day. For                some reason, it was the last line of the                poem he read that really stuck out.      FLASH BACK: (From page 2-3)       Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the                  ...and I will tell about it.                 I asked Chris who had written the poem.      What we SEE of Carine plays with the VOICE OVER TRACK and      SILENT with the production track; in essence lip synching      herself.      Chris' dialogue comes directly from the flashback image.                 Who wrote that?                 Well, it could've been either one of us.                Couldn't it?      We see pictures of Chris on the night-stand of Walt and      Billie's bedroom                 What would he tell about now?   What did                his voice sound like now?                  I realized that the words to my thoughts                were of less and less meaning. Chris was                writing his story and it had to be Chris                who would tell it.      The pictures in the scene BLUR as -                        (in a far away, tunnel-like                        sound)                Mom, help me.        Billie sitting bolt upright in the middle of the night,      tears rolling down her cheeks.      Walt awakens beside her.                 What is it?                 I wasn't dreaming! I didn't imagine it!                I heard his voice, Walt. I heard Chris.      Walt takes her in his arms, trying to squeeze life into      both of them.        Berms of cleared snow line the streets      1. A GAS STATION (Gold Hill Gas and Liquor)      We see Chris' writing appear on screen:                     9. A SIGN AGAINST A RADIO TOWER ""RADIO FAIRBANKS""(Perhaps      we hear a weather report)       We return to the area of Scene #1.      MUSIC OVER: Of religious scope.    Perhaps choral.      HELICOPTER SHOT: We travel a long ways across snowy      peaks and valleys (clearly far from anywhere) passing      between two escarpments of outer range bordering      bottomlands five miles wide until we barely see a tiny      form within it trudging through the snow. We overfly it.        Chris, crunching through two to three feet (not more) of      snow, in arctic parka, big boots, his warm hat, rifle      slung over his shoulder, and pack.       He moves TOWARD CAMERA. We PAN AROUND with him as he      walks past, where beyond Chris on the snow plain, rises a      tree line.        Its banks lined with a jagged shelf of frozen overflow.      At its center, a channel of gently flowing water, opaque      with glacial till. Beyond the far ice shelf, Chris      appears from the riverside treeline. He eases across the      ice, then wades through the latte-colored channel and on      to the other side.      REVERSE ANGLE: Chris moving toward the opposite tree      line, he turns back to the gentle river behind. Chris'      POV scanning the terrain.      From the river to a distant mountain peak and then to a      second mountain peak, triangulating his location. He      makes a drawing on a pad of paper and piles some medium-      sized rocks to mark the spot before moving on into the      trees.        Total silence across the beatific white vista of snow,      mountain, and colorless trees UNTIL a DISTANT ECHOING        Chris has skinned and is cooking a squirrel.        Chris packs the last of his camp and begins his march      upriver.        As Chris walks upon a clearing in the tree line, he      catches his first glimpse of Denali's (Mt. McKinley's)      high-blinding white bulwarks. Chris stands in awe. We      remain in his WIDE-SHOT POV as it -        But now Chris' tent sits in its foreground with the      moonlit Denali still visible.        CAMERA ANGLED SKYWARD into the broken rays of grey light.      We TILT DOWN to find (and TRACK through the trees with)      Chris moving along the river, when he sees something just       Chris' POV: Through the trees and fireweed, he sees      something metallic and rusty. Chris moves up through the      underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on      into the clearing, where before him:      A DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International      Harvester from the 1940's.      Chris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit      seeing that the engine is gone. As he moves around the      vehicle, we see several windows are cracked or missing      altogether. The green and white paint is badly oxidized.      Weathered lettering: Fairbanks City Transit System Bus        Broken whiskey bottles litter the floor. Chris may well      have found his new home. The bus is outfitted with a      bunk and a barrel stove. Previous visitors had left it      stocked with matches, bug dope, and other essentials.       We follow Chris back out of the bus, surveying the area      of the clearing. He loves what he sees.        He runs up a berm to look down into the river.      He runs from corner to corner of this ""Magic Bus"" area      like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee.      He climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in      the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the      snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. He grabs      a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into      water, and swallows it.      CRANE SHOT:   We PULL UP from Chris to high above the      clearing.         He re-enters the bus and pulls his pen from his pocket,      scribbling on the wall of the bus:       ANGLE: Chris:   He continues to write as he SPEAKS the      words aloud:                 ...the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou                shalt not return `cause the ""west is the                best."" And now after two rambling years,                comes the final and greatest adventure.      Chris is cleaning up the bus.                 The climactic battle to kill the false                being within and victoriously conclude                the spiritual revolution.      Chris shoveling snow away from the bus entrance with a      rock.                   Ten days and nights of freight trains and                 hitchhiking, bringing him to the great                 white north.      Back to Chris, REAL TIME as he continues to write as he      speaks:                  No longer to be poisoned by civilization,                 he flees, and walks alone upon the land                 to become lost in the wild.      Chris signs his doctrine -         Chris posts a found piece of paper on the inner wall of      the bus alongside his doctrine.      CU: Chris' hand, he writes and circles the number:         Chris comes out, rifle in hand. We TRACK with him as he      moves into the woods on the hunt.       Chris searching for game. He moves through the woods      along the river and at the base of a nearby mountain.      Finding animals for food seems more difficult than      expected.        Chris stumbles upon a caribou as it steps out from the      woods. He lines up his rifle on the animal, about to      pull the trigger, when its calf appears beside it.       He lowers his rifle, unwilling to take a shot that would      separate mother and child.        A spruce grouse is spied on a foreground branch.       The branch splinters and the bird makes haste.      ANGLE: Chris, rifle in hand.                 Shit!        Chris, cooking rice. We see his single bag of rice.     Its      amount tells us the hunting had better improve soon.      We explore a PASSAGE OF TIME throughout which CHRIS GETS      INCREASINGLY THIN AND PALE: hunting, sleeping, cooking,      rice dwindling, line-ups of scrawny shot birds. He adds      holes to his belt leather to accommodate his shrinking      waistline.        Chris bags a squirrel on a snowy plain.        Chris eats his measly catch but looks to his bag of rice      with concern, perhaps only a day or so left of his      rations. We come to the diary/log posted on the wall.      We see that he has been there for a week's worth of      entries as the squirrel is mentioned on day seven.           Chris is awakened by a new May sun, streaming light       through the windows of the bus.       POV: the sun, circling high in the heavens.    Snowmelt       dripping quickly across the windowpane.         Chris dances atop the bus, naked in the new spring.         Chris shaves.       (Note: We are in a time of year in this part of the world       where the sun dips behind the horizon only four hours a       day)         INTERCUT: SERIES OF ANGLES throughout which Chris remains       thin but his pallor improves:       1. The diary/log representing a small improvement on the       hunting front.       2. Undergrowth exposing itself through snowmelt.       3. Establish a small waterfall near the bus.       Landing on:        The snow has now all but vanished except on north-facing      slopes and shadowy ravines, exposing a range carpeted in      an amalgam of muskeg, alder thickets, and veins of      scrawny spruce.       Chris traipses along the seasons rose hips and      lingonberries, which he gathers in great quantity and      snacks on as he walks.        Chris shoots a porcupine.        The diary/log: DAY 30 - PORCUPINE        Chris stands triumphant at the peak of a 3000 foot butte      overlooking the bus. CIRCLE CAMERA around him 360      degrees recording the broad vista.      ANGLE: CU - He's beaming with satisfaction.      We begin a SLOW ZOOM OUT and then accelerate the ZOOM      encompassing the entire grandeur of the mountain with      Chris at its peak.

Chris drops the      machete and pulls his rifle from his shoulder. The moose      looks ready to charge Chris. There's no choice.      Chris aims carefully and fires six straight shots into      the moose's head, dropping it. Chris can hardly believe      his own success. He puts the rifle back on his shoulder,      just staring at the dead moose. He begins back-pedalling      away from it. Bit by bit, his steps turn into a jog and      then he turns and runs back toward the bus.        (Director's Note: Handheld)      Chris scrambles through his pack and finds the piece of      paper where he had written notes of how to cure beef by      smoking it, taught to him by Kevin, Wayne's hunter friend      back in South Dakota.        Back at the kill, the slow process of butchering begins.      (This ain't going to be pretty.)       1. The diary/log: BUTCHERING EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. 2.

We see Chris hidden behind a rise, watching a WOLF PACK      tug at the rancid meat from the carcass.        In and out of the bus. Day and night, portraying Chris      mourning his killing of the moose. He even plants a      cross by its skeletal remains.       Sunrise and nature awakens. Bird songs and flower      blooms. A waterfall cascades.        Chris reading Tolstoy's Family Happiness. His POV: The      page: what Chris reads:      I have lived through much and now I think I have found      what is needed for happiness.        A quiet, secluded life in the country with the       possibility of being useful to people...         Chris sits amongst the pink bunches of fireweed choking       the vehicles wheel wells, growing higher than the axles,       his back leaning against the bus, finishing the reading       of Family Happiness.       ANGLE: Chris, reading with great interest.   His POV: The       page: what Chris reads:       And then, on top of all that, you for a mate, and       children, perhaps - what more can the heart of a man       desire?       ANGLE: Chris: He looks up from his book. A gentle breeze       tickles morning flowers. The sunlight dances in a       coppice of aspen and leaves of trees above. The sound of       buzzing flies mutes. He is taking one last look at his       paradise.         Chris showers (PHOTO-SONIC)       MUSIC, LYNYRD SKYNYRD'S Simple Man (lyrics in cursive)       begins to play OVER:         My momma told me / when I was young       Chris packs his gear.       Come sit beside me / my only son       A last look about the bus.        Listen closely / what I say       Full pack and rifle mounted in WIDE SHOT beside the      Sushana River.      If you do this it will help you / some sunny day         Just take your time / don't live too fast      We pass the familiar landmark of the Mt. McKinley      clearing where Chris had camped.      Troubles w ill come / and they will pass      Chris walking and camping his way back to the Teklanika      River and the road home.      Find a woman / you'll find love      and don't forget son / there's someone up above...         In the trees beside the river, we find Chris. The river      is not yet in sight but Chris starts to HEAR it: A      building rumble.      As Chris exits the treeline, there she is: The Teklanika      at full flood. Seventy-five foot wide banks, replacing      the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. Snowmelt      from glaciers high in the Alaska range, its opaque      glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. And what had      been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume      and power of a freight train, a seventy-five foot wide      one.      Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one      slow, careful step into the river. Without mercy, WHAM!      the river kicks his feet out from under him! The branch      he holds SNAPS! By some miracle, his hands move like      lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below,      saving himself from a certain death.       We SEE the broken branch catapulted down river and into a      rocky shoot below. He pulls himself back onto the bank,      drops his pack at riverside, and eases to a sitting      position beside it.        It's pouring rain outside.   The rain pelts the top of the      bus.      Chris' pack is thrown onto the bunk. His hand appears at      the diary/log on the wall. He writes:         EXTREME CU: Beaded and shimmering from the past night's      rain, a bright red berry moves in the breeze like a tiny      vibrating bell. RACK FOCUS to Chris' eyes spying it. He      plucks it from its stem.        Chris adds another hole to tighten his belt.        Chris looking very thin. Too thin. He is noshing on a      bag of collected berries while reading from Boris      Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago.      ANGLE: The book                 Here she stopped and, closing her eyes,                took a deep breath of the flower-scented                air of the broad expanse around her. It                was dearer to her than her kin, better                than a lover, wiser than a book.       ANGLE: Chris pulls more berries from the bag and chews on      them as he reads.      ANGLE: The book                 For a moment, she re-discovered the                purpose of her life. She was here in                earth to grasp the meaning of its wild                enchantment and call each thing by its                right name.      ANGLE: Chris                        (echoing)                By its right name. By its right name.      He puts down the book and brings one of the ripe berries      in front of his face (as close as shot of when he picked      it.)      Chris then grabs Tanaina Plantlore, the flora and fauna      book he had gotten from the library in Fairbanks. And it      takes him out of the bus like a divining rod. His nose      in the book, he follows it.        Plant to plant.   Bush to bush.      SPEAKING ALOUD the names of everything he sees as he      identifies them with the book.                 Beautiful blueberries - Vaccinium                uliginosum. Eskimo potato - Hedysarum                alpinum...etc.      We follow Chris over a number of days as he eats from      these identified species of plant, each being logged, one      by one by name on the bus diary/log.        With Tanaina Plantlore by his side, Chris digs into the      soft earth on the berm of the river bank and digs up a      wild potato root.        Chris pulls the seeds from the root, noshing on them as      he reads from Doctor Zhivago.      We drift from him reading to the diary/log on the wall.      The day representing: July 24th      The diary/log: WILD POTATO ROOT      We drift back to Chris. Fatigue shows in his eyes as he      puts the book down and lays down to sleep.        WIDE SHOT of the bus. It's a beautiful July morning.      Birds chirp in the trees. A soft breeze sweeping down      from the mountains massages the valley below.      We SLOWLY ZOOM into the bus.        The open bag of seeds beside Chris' sleeping body. We      drift over to Chris' face, his lips de-hydrated, and skin      parched. He breathes heavily. He awakens. He tries to      sit up. It's a terrible struggle. Barely makes it to      his feet.      Chris stumbles to the door of the bus, looking up at the      hot sun. He has to sit back down on the small bus steps.      From his position on the step, he leans back into the bus      and is able to grab his water jug. He pours it into his      mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him. He      drinks it all. It spills over his face and chest.       We observe Chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside      his haunted eyes. And a curiosity seems to overtake him.      He crawls back to his copy of Tanaina Plantlore, flipping      the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph      identifying the wild potato root and the word ""edible""      beside it. He reads the page to its conclusion and as      almost an afterthought, turns the page to see if there      might be more.      The word -       jumps off the page at him.      The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato      root and warns that those with:      lateral veins, such as those invisible on the leaflets of      wild sweet peas are poisonous.      The words -      ...leading to partial motor paralysis...      ...inhibition of digestion...      ...nausea, starvation...       CRASH ZOOM into Chris' face, realizing his desperate      plight.        Chris kneels, holding one of the potato seeds to the      sunlight and there we see them -      the lateral veins that indicate poisonous seeds.        ANGLE: The diary/log: EXTREMELY WEAK. FAULT OF POTATO         Chris, barely able to walk, moves, at the pace of an      elderly man, with his rifle, through the underbrush.    He      needs food now.        He shoots a squirrel. But as he moves toward what he      thinks is his kill, the squirrel makes off with a      bleeding tail. Chris fires several desperate shots at      the squirrel but misses with each one.        Chris, having a fitful sleep.   Short breaths and      mutterings.        A big moon shines above and we find on a tree branch, the      squirrel Chris had clipped in the tail earlier in the      day. On the last legs of bleeding to death, it falls      from the tree.      The moon becomes the sun and we pass a couple of days      through visions of the nature about in varying light.        Chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full.      He is shirtless and absolutely emaciated. Frightening.      He pauses at the river's edge to take air into his lungs.      It's all he can do just to breath.      WIDE ANGLE TABLEAU (CONTINUOUS): Chris standing at the      river's edge catching his breath framed against the      background of the 3000 foot butte that he'd so recently      climbed with ease.        Now, maintaining this tableau, something moves from near       CAMERA RIGHT into frame. Bit by bit we'll realize it's a       LARGE BEAR ENTERING FRAME and moving away from camera       toward Chris. It lumbers to within feet of him.       CU OVER BEAR onto Chris: Chris, passive to the bear's       presence.       ANGLE: The bear, just as passive towards Chris, as though       he didn't represent enough of anything to eat.       BACK TO TABLEAU as the bear, passing Chris, disappears       over the rise toward the river. Chris, a motionless and       slight silhouette.         Chris lays on the floor. CU Chris: Orange light twinkles       in his eyes. Chris' POV: through the bus window, we see       the orange glow of smoke rising into the air. CU: Chris       writes in his diary log.                  Set small signal fire today - watched it                 die tonight.       Back to POV as the ambient orange light fades into the       blackness of smoke.         The diary/log: DAY 100 - MADE IT. BUT IN WEAKEST         Chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus. He       shakes his head as if trying to say something, and then       considers his rifle and abundant ammunition. But taking       his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an       option for him. ""No, no, no, don't do this to me."" The       frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream       out. He does, but with a low, gurgled animal sound. He shakesit off and looks to his copy of Doctor Zhivago fordistraction. Thumbing through the pages he focuses hiseyes on the page -ANGLE: The page: what he reads:           And that an unshared happiness is not          happiness...Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of thebook, scribbling across the page: He flips backwards a couple of pages to where he hadwritten the quote: He tears the back cover off the book and scratching thepencil across its blank side, writing these wordsquickly, as if in panic: And now, these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chrisrepeating:                  (with a weak voice)          Call everything by its right name.The drumbeat increases as he signs the note: We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that hehas put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of hisweakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and laysthem by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyesdance wildly.The drumming intensifies.Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun iscovered by a well-defined and puffy cloud.       His arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at      the blue sleeping bag made by his mother.      With great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces      his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the      sleeping bag.      SKYWARD, the cloud obscuring the sun.      Drumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!      We TIGHTEN on Chris' anguished face.      (Director's note: These CU's on Chris' face, combine      both static and hand-held CUs, upside down and right-side      up moving, zooms, and push-ins. Straight, side, and      dutch angles. Perhaps some intermittent distortion.)       We INTERCUT between Chris and the sky in a dance      transitioning to the next world. It is hopeful,      anguished, sad, and elated.        Chris, approaching the Annandale house.    His backpack on      and body healthy.      Billie parts the curtains, ecstatic to see Chris      approach, alive and healthy.      We SEE but do not hear her call to Walt.      A smiling Chris steps up the curb, approaching home.      Walt and Billie - we PUSH INTO them as they gleefully run      out the front door to their returning son.      PUSH INTO Chris - he dispatches his backpack to the      ground and runs toward his parents' embrace.                  What if you saw me running into your                 arms...      Chris, Walt, and Billie on the cusp of a jubilant and      loving embrace!                  Would you see then...      The DRUMMING resumes with a BLAST OF BASS and before an      embrace is possible...                  ...what I see now?         Chris looking at the sky, a cathartic tear falls from his      left eye. Another from his right as the obscuring cloud      clears the sun. Chris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH.His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines inhis eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true,deep serenity.The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth easeinto the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom.That's the way he settles to stillness, looking directlyinto our camera.                                        And he died alive.He made it.   He lived.   He loved.Cat Stevens' Miles from Nowhere plays OVER:As we PULL AWAY from Chris' face through the bus windowand up into the sky -We drift further and further away, above the stuntedtrees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tinywhite gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller andsmaller.REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris inscene #1.Then it's him:The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scenefrom behind, but now we are seeing it from the front andit is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on theedge of the Stampede Trail.

" ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" -- by M. Night Shyamalan     		 						written by						M. Night Shyamalan 	A NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE.  It dangles from the ceiling of	a basement.	LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs.	Anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence.  She stands	in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines	her slender body.  Her gentle eyes move across the empty room and	come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall.	She walks to the bottles.  Her fingertips slide over the labels.	She stops when she finds just the right one.  A tiny smile as she	slides it out.	Anna turns to leave.  Stops.  She stares at the shadowy basement.	It's an unsettling place.  She stands very still and watches her	breath form a TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR.  She's visibly	uncomfortable.	Anna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry.  Each step faster	than the next.  She climbs out of the basement in another burst	of LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS.    	Two place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table.	Take-out Chinese food sits half eaten on good china.  An empty	bottle of red wine sits between boxes of Chinese food.	Anna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater.	She hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to Malcolm. 		It's getting cold.	MALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and	tie on the sofa behind him.  A jacket and an overcoat lay on a	brirfcase next to him.	Malcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking,	intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study.  His	charming, easy-going smile spreads across his face.  He points. 		That's one fine frame.  A fine		frame it is.	Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a	dining room chair.  It's printed on aged parchment-type paper.	The frame is a polished mahogany.	He slips on the sweatshirt. 		How much does a fine frame like		that cost, you think?	Anna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm. 			(smiling)		I've never told you...  but you		sound a little like Dr. Seuss when		you're drunk.	Malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass. 		Anna, I'm serious.  Serious I am,		Anna.	Anna giggles.  She's clearly buzzed herself.  Malcolm doesn't get	it.  Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine.  Her attention	slowly moves to the framed certificate. 		Mahogany.  I'd say that cost at		least a couple hundred.  Maybe		three. 		Three?  We should hock it.  Buy a		C.D. rack for the bedroom. 		Do you know how important this is?		This is big time.			(beat)		I'm going to read it for you,		doctor. 		Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?	Anna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat.  She leans forward	her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to	tickle her. 		In recognition for his outstanding		achievement in the field of child		psychology, his dedication to his		work, and his continuing efforts to		improve the quality of life for		countless children and their		families, the City of Philadelphia		proudly bestows upon its son Dr.		Malcolm Crowe...  That's you...		the Mayor's Citation for		Professional Excellence.	Beat.  The power of the words sobers the two of them. 		Wow.  They called you their son. 		We can keep it in the bathroom.	Anna turns to Malcolm.  He smiles. 		It's not real, Anna.  Some		secretary wrote that up.  Don't		tell me you thought it was real?	Anna's expression becomes serious. 		What?	She just keeps staring.  Beat. 		Don't do the quiet thing.  You know		I hate it.	Beat. 		This is an important night for us.		Finally someone is recognizing the		sacrifices you made.  That you have		put everything second, including me,		for those families they're talking		about.	Malcolm plays softly with her face.  Anna takes his hands and	holds them steady. 		They're also saying that my husband		has a gift.  Not an ordinary gift		that allows him to hit a ball over a		fence.  Or a gift that lets him		produce beautiful images on a		canvas...  Your gift teaches		children how to be strong in		situations where most adults would		piss on themselves.			(beat)		Yes, I believe what they wrote		about you.	Anna lets go of his hands.  Anna's eyes are emotional.  Malcolm	smiles softly. 		Thank you.	Anna leans towards him.  They hold each other tight.  Beat. 		What are we hugging about again?	Anna laughs as she wipes her eyes. 		Nothing.  There wasn't supposed to		be any crying at this celebration.		Just a lot of drinking and sex.	Malcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns. 		I would like some red wine in a		glass.	Anna hands him his glass.  He stares at it. 		I would not like it in a mug.  I		would not like it in a jug.	Malcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said.  They crack up	laughing.  THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.  	TWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY.  They try to	turn on the light.  It doesn't come on. 		Bulb's out.	Anna giggles some more as Malcolm's shadow stumbles across the	bedroom. 	A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls on Anna as she stands in the corner of the	room.	Anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater.  She sways to a	pretend striptease song.	Malcolm can't hold back his grin.  He joins in -- slowly peeling	off the sweat-shirt.  He looks back to Anna.  She's stopped her	playful dance.  She's facing away from him.	He walks towards her.  HIS GRIN QUIETLY DISAPPEARS.  Malcolm's	face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the SHATTERED	WINDOW in their bedroom.  The wind moves through the room.  A	lamp lays broken on the ground by the window.	Malcolm kneels down.  Beat.  Anna's eyes fill with a quiet	awareness. 		He's still in the house.  	Malcolm spins around.  His heart stops.	Malcolm and Anna stare at the bathroom doorwary.  They know	someone is inside.  Beat.	Malcolm slowly starts towards the door.  The first thing that	comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor.  Then the	figure of a man comes into view.  A STRANGER stands bare chested	in the back of the bathroom. 	The STRANGER is about nineteen.  Drugged out.  Pitch black eyes	bulging.  His body is covered in scars and bruises.  His hands	are folded in front of him.  He shakes ever so slightly.  He has a	patch of white in his hair.	Malcolm speaks in a very calm voice.  Never takes his eyes off	the stranger. 		Anna, don't move.  Don't say a word.	Anna barely nods her understanding. 			(to the stranger)		This is forty-seven Locust Street.		You have broken a window and		entered a private residence.  Do		you understand what I'm saying?	The stranger slowly looks up for the first time.  His eyes lock	on Malcolm. 		You don't know so many things.	Beat. 		There are no needles or		prescription drugs of any kind in		this house.	The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway.  Malcolm	stumbles back onto the edge of the bed.	Anna sees the stranger for the first time.  Her face drains of	color.	The stranger looks at Malcolm.  He half grins. 		Are you drunk?	The stranger's stare slides to Anna. 		Did you get him drunk?	The stranger gazes at Anna.  Gazes directly into her eyes.  A	penetrating, unwavering stare. 		Do you know why you're scared when		you're alone?	Anna's expression instanly changes. 		I know.  		What do you want?  I don't		understand what you want.	The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm. 		What you promised.	Malcolm stops all movement. 		--My God. 		--Do I know you? 		Let's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm		Crowe. Recipient of awards from the		Mayor on the news.  Dr. Malcolm		Crowe, he's helped so many children...		And he doesn't even remember my		name?	Malcolm can't speak.  Beat.  The stranger's face starts to	tremble. 		I was ten when you worked with me.	Beat.  Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers. 		Downtown clinic?  Single parent		family?			(beat)		I had a possible mood disorder...			(beat)		I had no friends... you said I was		socially isolated.			(beat)		I was afraid -- you called it acute		anxiety...			(beat)		You were wrong.			(beat)		Come on, clear your head...  Male,		nine...  Single parent...  Mood		discorder... Acute anxiety.	Malcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer. 		I'm nineteen.  I have drugs in my		system twenty-four hours a day...		I still have no friends.  I still		have no peace.  I'm still afraid.	Tears jump into the stranger's eyes. 		...I'm still afraid.	Malcolm stands. 		Please give me a second to think.	Malcolm's shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the	stranger.  Beat. 		Bed Freidken? 		Some people call me freak. 		...Ronald...  Ronald Sumner?	Tears fall down the stranger's face. 		I am a freak.	Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words.  Something clicks	in his head. 		--Vincent?  		Vincent Gray?	VINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears.	Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep	waters. 		I do remember you, Vincent.  You		were a good kid.  Very smart...		Quiet...  Compassionate...		Unusually compassionate...	Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm. 		You forgot cursed.	VINCENT is fully crying now. 		You failed me. 			(whispers)		Vincent...  I'm sorry I didn't help		you...  I can try to help you now.	Vincent turns to the sink.  His hand goes in.  He turns arund and	raises a gun at Malcolm.  He FIRES.  A VIOLENT, EAR-SHATTERING	ECHO.  Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll	onto the bed.	Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head.  ANOTHER	HORRIFIC BLAST SPIKES THE AIR.  Vincent crumples onto the	bathroom floor.   	The legend, ""Two Years Later"" appears.	A man flips open a worn file folder on his lap.  Handwritten	notes fill every line.  At the top of the first page reads,	""Vincent Gray, age 10, Referred January 19, 1989.""	The man's hand touches the name almost reverently.	He glances through the page.  Words and phrases are circled	throughout the file.	""...Acute anxiety""	""...Socially isolated""	""...Possible mood disorder""	""...Parent status -- Divorced""	""...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad""	The man's hands flip the page.  At the top of this new page	reads, ""Cole Sear, age 8, Referred September 1998.""	As the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words	and phrases circled throughout this new case history.	""...Acute anxiety""	""...Socially isolated""	""...Possible mood disorder""	""...Parent status -- Divorced""	""...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad""	The hands close the notepad.  The hands are slightly shaking now.	WE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr. Malcolm	Crowe.	Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes	across the street.  He gazes blankly at the brownstones.  Beat.	A door opens.  Malcolm is brought out of his trance.	COLE SEAR steps out his front door.  Cole is a munchkin of a boy	with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around	him.	His hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side.	Cole carefully locks the door behind him.	He moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously.	Anxiously.	The eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a	pair of VERY LARGE GLASSES.  They look comical on him.	Malcolm rises to his feet.  He smooths out his shirt.  Looks down	and buttons his jacket.	When he looks up, Cole is gone.	Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy.  Cole runs at full	speed down the street and turns the corner.  TINY SNEAKERS 	For a second, Malcolm doesn't react.  The second passes.  He	stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too.  	Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk.  He comes to a hard stop at a	street intersection.  Searches.  Spots Cole running into a	parking lot.	COLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a	building.  He has to use all his strength to push open the highly	ornate doors.  He slips inside.	Malcolm jogs into the parking area.  His pace slows to a walk and	then to stillness as he gazes up at the building.  Its old stone	and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all	around it.  Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church	quietly.	A SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE.  Malcolm's hand goes to it	quickly.  He waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate	doors.  	Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews.	Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for	in the last row of the church.	He moves down the center aisle towards the back.	Malcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and	beige plastic soldiers.  Cole makes the soldiers talk to each	other. 			(soft)		Pro... Fun... Add...	The words are unintelligible.	Cole senses someone.  He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at	him.  The boy immediately goes white.  Every cell of his body	still with fear. 		It's okay, Cole.  Don't be		frightened.	Cole stays rigid.  Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen. 		My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.  I		was supposed to meet you today.		Sorry I missed our appointment.	Malcolm waits for a response.  None comes. 		Do you mind if I sit down?  I have		this injury from a couple of years		ago and it flares up every once in		a while just so I won't forget it.	Beat.  Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of	the seat.  Malcolm sits.	Cole fidgets with his soldiers.  Beat.  Malcolm looks over and	stares at Cole's glasses.  He leans forward to inspect them more	carefully. 		Your eye frames.  They don't seem to		have any lenses in them. 			(soft)		They're my dad's.  The lenses hurt		my eyes. 		I knew there was a sound explanation.	Malcolm returns to staring at his lap.  Beat. 		What was that you were saying		before with your soldiers?  Day pro		fun. 		...De profundis clamo ad te domine.	Malcolm stares surprised. 		It's called Latin.  It's a		language.	Malcolm nods at the information. 		All your soldiers speak Latin? 		No, just one.	Malcolm smiles at Cole.  His eyes drift down to Cole's arms.	Malcolm's smile slowly disappears.	Cole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES.  Some almost	healed.  Some fresh.  Malcolm looks around to gather himself.	Beat. 		I like churches, too.			(beat)		In olden times, in Europe, people		used to hide in churches.  Claim		sanctuary.	Cole looks up. 		What were they hiding from? 		Oh, lots of things, I suppose.  Bad		people for one.  People who wanted		to imprison them.  Hurt them. 		Nothing bad can happen in a church,		right?	Malcolm studies Cole's anxious face. 		Right.	Malcolm and Cole just stare at each other. 		I forgot your name. 		Dr. Crowe. 		You're a doctor.  What kind? 		I work with young people who might		be sad or upset or just want to		talk.  I try to help them figure		things out.	Beat. 		Are you a good doctor?	Malcolm smiles. 		I got an award once.  From the		Mayor. 		Congratulations. 		Thank you.  It was a long time ago.		I've kind of been retired for a		while.			(beat)		You're my very first client back. 		You use needles? 		No. 		Not even little ones that aren't		supposed to hurt? 		No. 		That's good.	Cole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew. 		I'm going to see you again, right? 		If it's okay with you?	Cole thinks it over carefully. 		It's okay with me.	Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other. 		And Cole, next time I won't be late		for you. 		Next time I won't be scared of you.	Cole turns and starts to the rear of the church.  Malcolm loses	himself in his thoughts.	When Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and	take a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table.  Cole pockets the	statue and quietly leaves the church.	Malcolm just sits and stares.  	The house is dimly lit.  Malcolm has to turn on the HALLWAY LIGHT. 		It's me.	He stops before a pile of mail collecting on a thin table.  He	stares at it blankly.  Almost every envelope has ""Over Due"" or	""Final Notice"" stamped on it.  	Malcolm stares down at the remains of a meal on the only place	setting on the table.  	Malcolm quietly walks into his bedroom.  Only A READING LIGHT IS 	Malcolm moves to her side.  The sight of her stops him.	He stares at his wife...	She huddles under a blanket, a wad of tissues in her hand.  He	takes it in silently.	His eyes move to her face...  One wisp of hair falls over her	soft lips.  OUTLINED IN THE SOFT READING LIGHT, Anna Crowe truly	looks like an angel.	Malcolm forms a tiny smile.  	Malcolm turns and moves for a narrow door in the hallway.	THE DOOR KNOB.  He tries to open it.  IT'S LOCKED.  Malcolm	reaches into his pockets.  Searches for his keys.  	The empty basement is no longer empty.  It's piled with file	cabinets and boxes of psychology and medical books.  A desk sits	in the corner next to the wine racks.	The room still feels unsettling.	Malcolm hunches over one of the books.  Rifles through a stack of	dusty books.  Pulls out a thick text.	The spine of the text reads, ""The Meridian Latin Dictionary.""	Malcolm sits back at his desk and opens Cole's file.  Handwritten	on the first page are the words,		""De profundis calms ad te, domine""	Malcolm starts working through the Latin text.  As he comes to	each word, he jots it down underneath the Latin.	Malcolm translates the last word.	He stares quietly at the paper.  The new words reads...		""Out of the depths, I cry to you Lord.""	Beat. 			(whispers)		...The mass for the dead.	The words seem to hang in the air forever.  	Old Philadelphia awakens...  For a moment, it's like we're back	in time.	A golden sun dances on the waters of Penns Landing.  Historical	old ships sit docked in its harbor...  The dark bronze surface of	the Liberty Bell reflects the dawn...  A majestic Independence	Hall stands watch as its city begins to stir...  A thirty foot	statue of Ben Franklin makes a proud silhouette against the	morning sky... 	FLUORESCENT HOUSE LIGHTS COME ON IN WINDOWS...  Jeeps and	hatchbacks start roaming the cobblestone streets...  Neon	restaurants signs flicker to life...  Traffic helicopters make	their rounds...  CAR ALARMS PIERCE THE AIR.  	A hand turns off a radio, shutting off the morning news.	A small dog with two different colored eyes sticks his head out	of the dryer, where he plays with the newly-dried clothes.	LYNN SEAR reaches in and pulls out a blouse.	She shakes it in the air and slips it on as she dresses hurriedly	for work.	Lynn is a woman in her late twenties.  One hundred percent South	Philly.  Hair teased.  She chews on an early morning piece of	Trident.  Under all of it, Lynn Sear is an attractive and	sweet-looking young woman.	Lynn enters THE KITCHEN through a swinging door.	A bowl of cereal and milk sit on a table in an empty kitchen.	Lynn stares at a handful of kitchen CABINETS and DRAWERS that are	open.	Lynn shakes her head. 		Cole.	She closes them one at a time before moving to the coffee machine.	Lynn shivers a little.  She leans over the thermostat and raises	the heat.  She returns to her post at the coffee machine. 	Lynn turns to see Cole standing in his private school uniform. 		Your Cocoa Puffs are getting soggy.	Lynn walks over to Cole.  Checks his tie. 		You got a spot.	Lynn unclips the tie.  Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as	Lynn walks back into the laundry room.	The dog is gone now.  Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a	new tie.  She finds one, then turns and steps back into the	kitchen and SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS.	Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open.	Cole sits at the kitchen table.  His hands are pressed flat on	the tabletop.	He looks shaken.	Neither says anything for a beat. 			(shaken)		Something you were looking for,		baby?	Beat. 			(shaken)		Pop Tarts.	Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink.  The pop tarts	are clearly visible. 		They're right here. 		Oh.	Cole gets up from the table.  Takes his pop tarts.  Doesn't make	eye contact. 		What are you thinking, Momma? 		Lots of things. 		Anything bad about me?	Lynn leans down. 		Look at my face.	Cole does. 		I wasn't thinking anything bad		about you, got it?	He looks at her eyes.  Beat. 		Got it.  			(soft)		That's Tommy, Momma.	Cole quietly kisses his mother on the cheek and starts out. 		Don't you want this?	Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts.  He walks back and	takes them from her before leaving.	Beat.  Lynn glances to the kitchen table.  Her gaze stops on the	TWO TINY HAND PRINTS OF SWEAT formed on the table's surface.	Lynn stands motionless in the kitchen.  She looks up and wraps	her arms around her shivering shoulders.  	TOMMY TAMMISIMO is a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid	who waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs in his school	uniform.	Cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps.	Lynn's face appears in the kitchen window.	The two boys begin their walk down the street to school.  Tommy	puts his arm around Cole.  Lynn waves.  Cole waves back.	When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight,	Tommy rips his arm away. 		Hey freak, how'd you like the ""arm		around your shoulder"" bit.  I just		made it up.  Went with it.  That's		what great actors do.  It's called		improv.	Tommy starts to run ahead, he turns and back pedals. 			(taunting)		Be careful...  I hope no one jumps		out and gets you.	Tommy runs away.	Beat.  Cole looks around nervously.  	The last uniformed boys and girls rush into the front doors of	St. Anthony's Academy as the FINAL BELL SOUNDS.	Cole is the last one to go in.  He stands alone on the sidewalk.	He looks like he'd rather be anywhere but there.	Beat.	He buries his hands in his pockets and begins a quiet walk by	himself into the school.  	The front door CREAKS open as Cole walks in after school.  He	looks around before closing the door.  His eyes stop on Lynn	seated in the open doorway of the den.  Malcolm is seated with	her.  They both look up.	Lynn comes out.  She reaches Cole -- kneels down in front of him. 			(whispers)		How was school, baby?	Cole shrugs. 			(whispers)		You know, you can tell me things if		you need to.	Cole doesn't respond.  Beat. 			(whispers)		Well, you know what I did today?	Cole shakes his head ""No."" 			(whispers)		I won the Pennsylvania Lottery in		the morning.  I quit my jobs.  Ate		a big picnic in the park with lots		of chocolate mouses pie and then		swam in the fountain all afternoon...			(smiling)		What did you do?	Cole starts to smile too.  He thinks. 			(whispers)		I was picked first for kickball		teams at recess.  I hit a grand		slam to win the game and everyone		lifted me up on their shoulders and		carried me around cheering.	Cole and Lynn smile at each other.  Beat.	Lynn tries to hide the utter sadness behind her smile. 		I'll make triangle pancakes.  You		got an hour.	Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the	kitchen.  	The den doubles as a playroom.  Boxes of old toys sit in the	corner.  A small, plastic, multi-colored table sits on the rug.	Cole appears in the doorway.  Malcolm sits up and smiles.	He points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table. 		You want to sit?	Cole nods very softly, ""No."" 		Don't feel like talking right now?	Cole nods again very softly, ""No."" 		How about we play a game first?	Cole looks a little more interested. 		It's a mind-reading game...  Did I		mention I could read minds?	Cole nods, ""No."" 		Here's the game.  I'll read your		mind.  If what I say is right, you		take a step forwards the chair.  If		I'm wrong, you take a step		backwards the doorway.  If you		reach the chair, you sit.  If you		reach the door, you can go.  Deal?	Cole tilts his head, then nods, ""Yes.""	Malcolm presses his fingers to his temples like a vaudeville	magician.  He closes his eyes tight. 		Just after your mom and dad were		divorced, your mom went to a doctor		like me and it didn't help her.		And so you think I'm not going to		help you.	Beat.  Cole, surprised, takes a small step forward. 		You're worried because she said she		told him things.  Things she		couldn't tell anybody else.			(beat)		Secrets.	Cole takes a step.  Malcolm opens his eyes.  He looks right at	Cole. 		You have a secret.  But you don't		want to tell me.	Beat.  Cole takes another step.  The next step will put him at	the chair.  Malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple. 			(whispers)		You don't have to tell me your		secret if you don't want to.	Malcolm smiles.  Returns his fingers to the mind-reading	position.  Malcolm looks to Cole's arm.  Cole is wearing A LARGE	SILVER WATCH.  It swims on his thin wrist.  It could probably	slide up to his shoulder.  Malcolm closes his eyes. 		Your father gave you that watch as		a present before he left.	Cole takes a step BACK.  Beat.  Malcolm lowers his hands	surprised. 		He forgot it in a drawer.  It		doesn't work.	Beat.  Malcolm puts his fingers to his temple.  This time a	little bit slower.  He gazes at Cole's school uniform. 		You don't like to say much at		school.  You're an excellent		student however.  You've never been		in any kind of serious trouble.	Beat.  Cole takes a slow step back.  Beat. 		We were supposed to draw a picture.		Anything we wanted...  I drew a man.		He got hurt in the neck by another		man with a screwdriver.  		You saw that on T.V., Cole?	Cole answers by taking a small step back.  Beat. 		Everybody got upset.  They had a		meeting.  Momma started crying.			(beat)		I don't draw like that anymore. 		How do you draw now? 		I draw people with smiles, dogs		running, and rainbows.			(beat)		They don't have meetings about		rainbows. 			(soft)		I guess they don't.	Malcolm looks down at Cole's feet.  They're almost at the	doorway.  One more step and he's there.  Cole is very still.  He	doesn't move at all. 			(whispers)		What am I thinking now?	Malcolm takes his time before speaking.  He just stares.  No	fingers to the temple.  No games.  He just stares.  Beat. 		You're thinking...			(beat)		I don't know what you're thinking,		Cole.	Cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room. 			(whispers)		I was thinking...  you're nice.			(beat)		But you can't help me.	Cole's tiny figure steps away.  Malcolm stares helplessly at the	empty doorway where his client used to stand.   	Malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian	restaurant.  He stops in the dining room and searches the many	candle-lit tables.  He finds Anna.	Anna sits alone at a corner table.  The remains of her half-eaten	dinner lay on the only place setting on the table.  A small PIECE	OF CAKE WITH A CANDLE in it sits untouched.	Anna stirs sugar in her coffee as Malcolm sits in the seat across	from her.  She gently stops stirring, but doesn't look up.  Beat. 		I thought you meant the other		Italian restaurant I asked you to		marry me in.	Anna isn't laughing.  Not even close. 		I'm so sorry.			(beat)		I can't seem to keep track of time.	Anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee. 		It didn't go well today.  Spent		some time after trying to get my		head together.	Anna looks around for the waiter. 		They're so similar, Anna.  They		have the same mannerisms.  The same		expressions.  The same thing		hanging over them.			(beat)		It might be some kind of abuse.	That makes Anna turn back.  She glances across the table, then	looks down. 		There are cuts on Cole's arms.		Fingernail marks, I think.  Looks		like defensive cuts.	Malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face. 			(beat)		Possibly a teacher, neighbor.			(beat)		I don't think it's the mother.		Just a gut thing.  The way she		deals with him.  It doesn't fit.			(beat)		Hard to say this early.  Could		just be a child climbing a lot of		trees.	Malcolm loses himself in his thoughts.  The waiter drops off the	check on the table.  Anna grabs it before Malcolm and quickly	signs it. 		I know I've been kind of out of it		for a long while and you resent it.		You do.  I know you're mad.  I know		it's put some distance between us.	Beat. 		But I'm getting a second chance		here.  I can't let it slip away.	Anna waits till he's done and rises from the table.  She pushes	her chair in hard and walks away without a word.  Malcolm sits	alone and stares at the piece of cake with a candle on it. 			(soft)		...Happy Anniversary.  	Cole is seated on the front stoop of his brownstone.  On the	steps and on the landing are his plastic soldiers in the grips of	a war.	Malcolm sits with his bag and overcoat on the step next to him.	Malcolm just observes quietly.  Beat.	Cole glances up as he plays.  Sees Malcolm's expression. 		You want to ask me a question? 		See, this is why I lose at poker.		Yes, I do have a question.	On the step are two rows of soldiers facing each other.  To one	side are a couple soldiers covered by a tissue.  Malcolm points	to them. 		What happened to those two?  Being		under tissue paper can't be a good		thing.	Cole removes the tissue. 		That's Private Jenkins and Private		Kinney.  They got killed.  Private		Jenkins has a baby girl that was		born seven pounds, six ounces.		He's never seen her.  He wanted to		get back to Blue Bell, Pennsylvania		and hold her...	Cole points to the other soldier. 		Private Kinney's wife is really		sick -- she has something called a		brain anism. 			(soft)		You mean aneurysm. 		Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get		back safe to take care of her.	Beat.  Cole's face becomes emotional.  Tears fill his eyes. 		It's sad they died, isn't it?	Malcolm falls into silence and stares at his client.  Beat.  Cole	wipes his eyes quickly. 		Don't look at me.			(beat)		I don't like people looking at me		like that.	Malcolm takes in Cole's gesture and expression. 		Stop looking at me.	Malcolm looks down. 		Where should I look then, Cole? 		Look over there.	Cole points to the corner of the street.  Malcolm slowly turns.	He sits in profile to Cole.  Beat. 		It's very unusual for someone your		age to understand the kind of		problems that Private Jenkins and		Private Kinney have or even to be		thinking about them at all...	Malcolm continues to stare at the street.  Beat. 		It is okay if I look back now?	Cole doesn't answer. 		Tap the foot once for ""No"" and		twice for ""Yes.""	Cole taps his foot once.	Malcolm sits patiently.  Beat.  They don't say anything for a	while. 		You wouldn't want to take a walk,		would you?	Cole looks up from his soldiers.  Malcolm stares at the far side	of the street.	Cole taps his foot twice.  	The two of them walk down a row of brownstones across from a park	where children Cole's age are playing. 		I walk this way to school with		Tommy Tammisimo. 		He your best buddy?	Cole almost smiles. 		He hates me. 		You hate him?	Cole shakes his head, ""No.!	Malcolm thinks for a bit. 		Your mom set that up?	Cole nods ""Yes."" 		You ever tell her about how it is		with Tommy? 		I don't tell her a thing. 		Why? 		Cause she doesn't look at me like		everybody and I don't want her to.		I don't want her to know. 		Know what? 		That I'm a freak.	Malcolm stops walking.  The words hit him hard.  He stares at	Cole. 		Listen to me.  You are not a freak.		Don't you believe anybody that		tells you that.  It's bullshit and		you don't have to grow up believing		that.	Beat.  Cole is surprised. 		You said the ""s"" word. 		Yeah.  Sorry.	Malcolm's face is filled with emotion.  Cole is suddenly hit by	Malcolm's passion.  Beat.  Cole nods slowly as he looks at	Malcolm with different eyes.	They start walking again in silence.  They turn a corner and move	down another street.  Cole spots an old man with a cane standing	at the gate of a brownstone. 		Is it okay if I do something?  I		have to do something.	Malcolm nods ""yes"" as they continue walking.  Cole slows as they	approach the old man.  As we get closer, we make out the man can	barely see. 		Hi, Mr. Marschal.	MR. MARSCHAL leans over his gate and stares at Cole for a few	seconds. 		Guten Tag, Cole.	Mr. Marschal has a thick German accent.  The old man squints down	the block with a concerned expression. 		What's wrong? 		Mrs. Marschal.  She went food		shopping.  She's running late.	Beat. 		Ich Habe Durst.	Malcolm's eyes dart to Cole. 		Wunderbar!  Where did you learn to		speak German? 		I just know a couple lines. 		Yes, you may have a drink.  What		would you like? 		Lemonade, please.	Mr. Marschal smiles at Cole before walking back inside his house.	Cole turns back to Malcolm. 			(sad)		Mr. Marschal gets real lonely. 		What about Mrs. Marschal? 			(whispers)		She died a long time ago.  	This brownstone has been home to the Marschal's for many, many	years.  It's filled with a lifetime of memories.  Memories shared	by two people.	Two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that	overlook the street...  A corner table displays fancy wooden	chess set.  The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust...	An easel stands before a piano.  The incomplete water color	painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench	sits sadly on the faded yellow paper.	Malcolm takes in the living room silently.  He stands near the	open door.	Cole walks through the room.  Tiny eyes searching carefully.  He	leans behind the sofa looking for something.  Malcolm watches	Cole with a crinkled brow.	Cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall. 		Maybe Jill will play for us when		she gets back.	Cole turns to find Mr. Marschal standing with a glass of	lemonade.  Cole takes it from his shaking hands. 		Thank you.	Mr. Marschal shuffles over to the sofa.  Takes a seat.	Cole begins surveying the room again.  Beat.  His eyes finally	come to rest on a plant seated in the corner.  He stares at it... 	Cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plant.	Cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant aside.  THE 	Malcolm calls to Cole under his breath. 		Cole-- 		What's going on there?	Mr. Marschal strains to see across the room.	Cole doesn't answer either of them.  Instead, he continues to	push the plant aside revealing AN AIR VENT.  Cole gently reaches	over and takes off the metal face.  It slips right off.	Cole's hands disappear into the darkness of the vent.  They	reemerge holding a STACK OF NOTEBOOKS.	Malcolm becomes very still.	Cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to Mr.	Marschal.  Cole carefully places them on his lap. 		Is this for me?	Mr. Marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick	glasses hanging from his neck.  He places them on the tip of his	nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his face. 		What's this?  Jill's keeping a		diary.	Malcolm takes an involuntary step forward.	Mr. Marschal starts flipping through the notebooks. 		She's full of surprises...	He gets to the last book.  His hands become still as he stares at	the final page of writing. 			(whispers)		She hasn't written anything for		some time.	Beat.  Mr. Marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks.  Looks up	to Cole.  Cole just stands quietly.	Mr. Marschal's eyes slowly fill with tears of realization.  They	gently spill down his weathered face. 		Oh no...	Cole takes a deep breath.  Trying hard not to cry himself.  The	sight of Mr. Marschal weeping shakes Cole.	Cole softly lays his hand on Mr. Marschal's silver hair.  Mr.	Marschal reaches up and clutches his small hand.	They stay like that for a while.  Beat.  Mr. Marschal lets go and	brings the notebooks tighter to his body.	Cole quietly walks to Malcolm who stands motionless.  He stares	down at Cole in a daze.	Cole turns his head, crying. 			(softly)		Stop looking at me.  	Malcolm sits still in his office chair.  His eyes are fixed at a	point in space.  He brings a slim, black tape recorder to his	mouth.  		April or March of Eighty-seven.		Two weeks into sessions with		Vincent Gray.  I was treating a		couple, Donald and Robin Wagner,		who had lost their child to		Leukemia.  They were waiting with		Vincent in the reception room of		the downtown clinic.  They were		alone together maybe fifteen		minutes.  When I entered the room,		all three were crying.  The		Wagner's progress from that		afternoon was dramatic and sudden		....  As if some door had been		opened for them.			(beat)		I'm not at all clear what happened		in those fifteen minutes.  But I		now believe Vincent tried to tell		me something, show me something and		I didn't listen.			(beat)		Cole Sear allowed me to witness		something today.			(beat)		This time I'm going to listen.	A long silence.  CLICK.  The tape recorder turns off.  	Lynn holds a laundry basket on her hip as she fiddles with the	thermostat in the hall.  The house is cold.  Lynn wears a winter	jacket in the house.	Lynn turns and moves into the shadowy hallway.  No lights.  The	house seems somewhat ominous.  Beat.	Lynn's eyes dart to an open guest room like she just saw	something.  She stares in the doorway until a SOUND TURNS HER IN 	She picks up balled-up boy's sweat socks and dirty T-shirts	laying on the carpet.  When she reaches the end of the hall, she	HITS A LIGHT SWITCH.  The hall LIGHTS UP REVEALING A WALL OF	PHOTOS.  Lynn forms a tiny smile.	Snapshots of Cole and Lynn's life hang before her eyes.	Cole's birthday parties...  Lynn and Cole at an amusement park...	Cole under the Christmas tree...  Cole on Lynn's shoulders in a	pool...  Cole with a group of neighbors at a barbecue...	Lynn takes a step forward.  Lynn's face betrays the fact that she	notices something she never noticed before.  She touches a photo	of three-year-old Cole. 	Lynn looks to the adjacent photo -- the barbecue photo --	Everyone stands with hot dogs and sodas.  Lynn searches the	picture.  Her eyes suddenly stop at the TINIEST BLUR OF WHITE  	Lynn takes it all in curiously.  	Lynn moves into Cole's room with the laundry basket balanced on	her hip.  The Walkman headphones on her head blares A MUFFLED	TECHNO DANCE BEAT.  Lynn starts picking clothes up around Cole's	room.	This bedroom is an eerie place.  The shadows seem to make shapes	and figures.  All the furniture is wood -- old fashioned.  The	lamps, the paintings on the wall -- antiques as well.	The most striking feature of the room, however, is the homemade	tent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to chairs and	bureaus.  It takes up a large corner of the room.	A sign hangs over the bedsheets. 	Lynn grabs the spiderman P.J.s that drape over the tent.	A German Shepherd Puppy sleeps on the pillow.  SEBASTIAN lifts	his head sleepily and peers at Lynn before returning to his	slumber.	Lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under	Cole's pillow.  Slides it out...  It's a VACATION PHOTO of a	couple.  Lynn and Cole and a man.  The man looks in every way a	larger version of Cole.	The picture has a visible effect on Lynn.  She lets out a shaky	breath before returning the photo to its hiding place.	Lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll	cover desk next to the bed.	The desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings.	Lynn's eyes are drawn to the papers.	Her curious gaze turns serious.  Her mouth opens a tiny bit	involuntarily.	THE PAPERS are strewn with lines of handwriting.  Countless	lines.  Thousands of words...  Some horizontal, some vertical...	The writing moves in arcs and flows in various size -- written at	great speed -- every word connected by a single pen stroke --	everything written in one continuous motion.	Lynn slowly spins the papers, taking in some of the phrases...	 ...Christ break the freaking glass oh no God no what the hell is	going on Quiet the damn baby I'll cut you I swear it someone stop	the burning I'll kill you I'll kill all you bastard... 	The words go on and on.	Lynn removes her hands from the paper.  She pulls her headphones	off slowly.   	Malcolm stares as the rain pelts the windows of the den. 		...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh		with a lady who works in a toll		booth.			     COLE (o.s.)		What if she has to pee when she's		working?  You think she just holds		it? 		I don't know.  I was just thinking		the same thing.	Beat.			     COLE (o.s.)		You ask a lot of questions about my		dad today.  How come?	Cole is playing behind the couch.  All we see is the top of his	head. 		Sometimes, we don't even know it,		but we do things to draw attention.		Do things so we can express how we		feel about issues...  Divorce or		whatever.	Every now and then we get glimpses of things Cole is playing with	peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out	what he's doing. 		One night, as an example...  leave		something on a desk for someone to		find.	The top of Cole's head stops moving. 		Cole, have you ever heard of		something called free-writing?  Or		free-association writing?	Cole shakes his head, ""No."" 		It's when you put a pencil in your		hand and put the pencil to a paper		and you just start writing...  You		don't think about what you're		writing...  You don't read over		what you're writing...  You just		keep your hand moving.	Cole has become very still.  He looks right at Malcolm. 		After awhile if you keep your hand		moving long enough, words and		thoughts start coming out you		didn't even know you had in you...		Sometimes they're things you heard		from somewhere...  Sometimes		they're feelings deep inside...			(beat)		Have you ever done any free-		association writing, Cole?	Beat.  Cole nods, ""Yes."" 		What'd you write? 		Words. 		What kind of words? 		Upset words.	Beat. 		Did you ever write any upset words		before your father left?	Beat. 		I don't remember.	Malcolm watches him carefully.  Beat.  Malcolm waves the question	off casually. 		Can you do something for me?	Malcolm smiles.  He rises and grabs his coat. 		Think about what you want from our		time together.  What our goal		should be? 		Something I want? 		If we could change something in		your life, anything at all, what		would you like that to be?	Cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully. 		You don't have to answer now.	Malcolm heads for the door, stops when Cole emerges from behind	the couch.  Cole is wearing his father's jacket, it hangs to the	ground like a dress. 		Instead of something I want, can I		have something I don't want?	Malcolm turns back to Cole.  Malcolm nods ""Yes.""  Beat. 		I don't want to be scared anymore.	Cole's sad eyes stare up at Malcolm.  	The surface of Malcolm's desk is covered with open texts.	Malcolm pours over a thick reference book.	He circles a phrase...	""...resulting bruises and abrasions on arms and legs may, in	fact, be self-inflicted.""	Malcolm appears disturbed by the thoughts running through his	head. 	His face turns up to the ceiling. 			(loud)		Are you calling me? 			     ANNA (o.s.)		What?  You don't see enough of me		at the store?	Malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches	his legs.			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)		On my way to the flea market in		Amish country.  Thought maybe you		want to come.  Show me how to buy		at these things.			     ANNA (o.s.)		I trust you...  Besides, I don't		know if I'm up for the Amish today.		You can't curse or spit or anything		around them.	Malcolm smiles at Anna.			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)		I thought you'd want to get out.		You've been kind of down.	Malcolm slowly stops smiling.			     ANNA (o.s.)		That's very sweet.  I'm okay.			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)		Do you think I should stop by on my		way back?  Show you what I got?		It's not a problem.	Malcolm shakes his head in disbelief.			     ANNA (o.s.)		You know that's probably not the		best idea.  I'll just wait to see		them in the store.			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)		Okay.  Fine.  Understood.			(beat)		I'm off then.			     ANNA (o.s.)		Don't step in the horse manure.			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)		Thanks. 	Malcolm moves to the narrow basement window. 	We see SEAN, an attractive young man in his late twenties.	He gets into his car across the street.  He just sits there for a	moment before putting his forehead to the steering wheel. 			(under his breath)		Give it up, kid.	Malcolm turns away from the window as Sean's car starts up and	pulls away from Malcolm's house.  	STANLEY CUNNINGHAM is a teacher in his late forties.  He writes a	question on the board. 		Can anyone guess what city was the		capital of the United States of		America from 1790 to 1800?	Mr. Cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine	year old private school students.  They stare back at him blankly.	Cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big	eyes. 		...I'll give you a hint, it's the		city you live in.	The class says the answer in unison. 		Philadelphia. 		Right...  Philadelphia is one of		the oldest cities in the country.		A lot of generations have lived and		died in this city...  Almost every		place you visit has a history and a		story behind it.			(beat)		Even this school and the grounds		they sit on...  Can anyone guess		what this building was used for a		hundred years ago, before you went		here, before I went to this school		even?	Stanley Cunningham looks over the class of blank faces.  He's	just about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up.	Mr. Cunningham looks surprised to see who it is. 		Yes, Cole? 		They used to hang people here.	Mr. Cunningham furrows his brow.  Beat. 		That's not correct.  Where'd you		hear that? 		They'd pull the people in crying		and kissing their families bye...		People watching would spit at them.	Beat. 		Cole, this was a legal courthouse.		Laws were passed here.  Some of the		first laws of this country.  This		building was full of lawyers.		Lawmakers. 		They were the ones who hanged		everybody.	Mr. Cunningham chuckles.  Cole's face turns cement grey. 		I don't know which one of these		guys told you that, but they were		just trying to scare you, I think.	Tommy Tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering.	Cole glances up.  Sees all the eyes on him.  He glances at the	teacher who is still staring. 		I don't like people looking at me		like that. 		Like what? 		Stop it!	Mr. Cunningham sees the traumatized expression on Cole's face and	instantly stops smiling. 		I don't know how else to look-- 		You're a stuttering Stanley!	Mr. Cunningham's face becomes still.  So does the classroom. 		Excuse me? 		You talked funny when you went to		school here.  You talked funny all		the way to high school!	The class falls into stunned silence.  Mr. Cunningham takes an	involuntary step towards Cole's desk. 		What-- 		You shouldn't laugh at people.  It		makes them feel bad.	Mr. Cunningham moves closer to Cole. 		How did you--? 		Stop looking at me.	Cole covers his eyes with his hands. 		Who have you been s-speaking to?	We see Cole's mouth under his covered eyes. 		Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering		Stanley! 		Who!	Mr. Cunningham is standing right over Cole's desk now. 		Stuttering Stanley! 		S-ssstop that! 		Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering		Stanley! 		S-ssssstop it! 		Stuttering-- 		--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!	MR. CUNNINGHAM SLAMS HIS HAND ON COLE'S DESK.  Cole's hands drop	from his eyes.  The teacher's face is burning red.	The children in the room are frozen.  Completely startled.	Cole's eyes are filled with tears.	Mr. Cunningham's expression drains of anger as Cole Sear begins	to cry.  	Cole is seated in the school library by himself.  He sits at a	long center table near the windows.  His head is laying on his	folded arms on the table.	Malcolm peeks his head in the door -- unsure if he's in the right	place.  He spots Cole and enters the room.  He silently takes a	seat across from Cole.  The eight-year-old looks up.  Cole's eyes	are hard -- filled with anger. 		Hey, big guy.	Cole stares for a second. 		I don't want to talk about anything.	Cole lowers his head.  Malcolm just sits and thinks. 	Cole turns his head and stares at the windows.  Malcolm takes in	the sad vision of this boy.  It affects him.  Beat. 		Do you like magic?	Cole's face softens a bit.  He turns from the windows and looks	to Malcolm.  Beat.  Cole nods, ""Yes.""	Malcolm pulls out a penny from his pocket.  He places it in his	right hand. 		Watch the penny closely.	Malcolm closes his hand around the penny. 		I do the magic shake...	Malcolm shakes his hand in circles.  Cole watches his hand	carefully. 		And suddenly the penny has		magically traveled to my left hand...	Cole looks to Malcolm's closed left hand.  Malcolm doesn't open	it. 		But that's not the end of the trick.		With another magic shake, the penny		travels into my shirt pocket...	Cole's eyes lock on Malcolm's shirt.  Malcolm taps the pocket but	doesn't open it. 		But that's still not the end!...  I		do a final magic shake...  and		suddenly...  The penny returns to		the hand where it started from.	Malcolm opens his right hand.  The penny sits quietly in the	center of his palm.	Cole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face.  Beat.	Cole cracks a smile. 		That isn't magic. 		What? 		You just kept the penny in that		hand the whole time... 		Who me?	Malcolm smiles a mischievous smile.  He places the penny on the	table.  Cole stares at it and then looks to Malcolm. 		I didn't know you were funny. 		I forgot myself.	Malcolm and Cole share a warm look. 	Cole's expression changes back to sadness as he looks to the	windows.  Malcolm leans across the table and whispers. 		Cole...	Cole looks at Malcolm. 		One day...			(beat)		You're going to sound just like		them.	Beat.  Cole's chin starts to tremble.  His voice cracks. 			(whispers)		Promise?	Beat. 			(whispers)		Promise.	Malcolm and Cole sit in silence and listen to THE SOUND OF   	Malcolm sorts through the many bills on the mail table.			     WOMAN (o.s.)		Malcolm, sit your cute butt down		and listen up.			(beat)		Are you listening?	Malcolm turns AT THE SOUND OF THE WOMAN, and moves into the empty	living room where the T.V. is on.  A blanket lays crumpled on the	sofa.  		No doubt about it.  Anna's like my		sister.  You better make her happy...		And I'm not talking about -- mmm		this tastes like real butter --		kind of happy...  I'm talking about		Julie Andrews twirling around like		a mental patient on a mountain top		-- kind of happy.  		You're really lucky.  She's got so		much love for you.  Don't tell her		I told you, but she said she loved		you from the first time she met you		on the street.  She'd do anything		for you.			(crying)		I love you guys.			(more crying)		My nose is running.  Why isn't		someone getting me a tissue? 	Malcolm can't help smiling as he stares at the flickering images.	He turns and looks down the hall to their bedroom.  	Malcolm moves into their bedroom. 	Malcolm moves to the bathroom door and opens it slowly.  	Malcolm steps into the bathroom quietly.  He stares at the	silhouette of Anna's body through the smoked glass of the shower.	Anna stands still, her head tilted back.	Malcolm watches quietly.  By his experience, it's clear he's	taken by his wife's beauty.	Malcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to the	sink.  Malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble	surface.	He reaches out and picks it up.  The label on the plastic bottle	reads,		""Zoloft Anti-depressant""		""To be taken twice daily""	Malcolm gently puts down the plastic bottle.  He gazes at the	still figure of his wife as the water covers her.	Malcolm leaves the bathroom.  He makes sure not to make a noise	with the door as he closes it shut.  	Colorful balloons flutter in the wind in front of an old grey	stone home. 	Cole and an overweight boy named BOBBY are seated at a dining	table covered in colorful paper.  A stack of birthday presents	are sitting on the table next to a cake.	The house is filled with the SOUND OF CHILDREN PLAYING AND 	Cole and the overweight boy are the only ones in the dining room.	Bobby watches with a dull expression as Cole moves his hand in	circles in the air. 		...Then you do the magic shake.		And now the penny moves from my		pocket all the way to the hand it		started in.	Cole smiles and holds out his hand.  His fingers open to reveal	the penny.	Bobby stares. 		That's stupid.	Cole loses his smile. 		It's supposed to be funny. 		It's stupid.	Cole and the overweight boy stare at each other. 		Give me my penny back.	Cole gives the boy his penny.  Beat.  Cole gazes at Bobby. 			(almost inaudible)		...Don't be sad.	Bobby looks up sharply. 			(hard)		What'd you say? 			(shaken)		...Nothing.	Bobby stares down at him before returning his attention to his	tattered napkin.	The two boys sit in silence.  	Cole sits alone in the corner of the living room.  The open	kitchen doorway is next to him.  Inside the kitchen are Lynn and	DARREN'S MOM speaking.  It's clear they're from different worlds.	Lynn is wearing tight clothes with hair teased to dramatic	heights.  Darren's mom is in a designer suit. 		...He doesn't get invited places. 		It's our pleasure. 		The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese		party a year ago.  He hid in one of		those purple plastic tunnels and		didn't come out. 		Chuck E. who? 		Cheese.  It's a kid's place.	Darren's mom smiles formally and turns to give the catering	people instructions on how to lay out the food on her sterling	silver trays. 		He's my whole life.	Darren's mom turns back to Lynn, the forced smile on her face. 		I work at an insurance place and at		Penny's, so Cole can go to that		good school. 		J. C. Jenny's?	Lynn nods ""Yes."" 			(bullshit)		Good for you. 		I wish I could be like my momma		though.  She always knew what was		wrong.  Knew just what to say.	Darren's mom glances at her expensive watch. 		Cole's going through something bad.		He won't talk to me.			(beat)		I'm his momma.			(emotional)		And I don't know what's wrong and		I don't know what to say.	Lynn drowns in her thoughts.  Cole moves away from the kitchen	with sad eyes.  	Cole walks past two expensively-dressed mothers eating hors	d'oeuvres as they move down the hallway. 		Did you have the Brie? 		It tasted like cheese whiz.	They pass when Cole moves down the shiny mahogany wood hallway.	The women's conversation FADES AWAY behind him.	Cole turns a corner and comes to a dead stop.  He turns white as	he stares at an open CRAWL SPACE CLOSET a few feet away.  Cole's	eyes are riveted in the darkness of the closet.  Beat. 	Tommy Tammisimo is one of the children.  He talks with the	birthday boy, DARREN, a skinny kid in a party hat. 		I even got a trailer. 		For what?  You only had one line. 		You're slow, you know that.  The		star of the commercial always has		his own trailer.  You need to think		about your character alone.	Tommy glances down the hall and sees Cole standing frozen staring	at the crawl space closet.	Tommy grabs Darren. 		Darren, check it out.	     DARREN looks down the hall to Cole. 		My dad made me invite him.	Tommy nudges Darren to move down the hall.  Cole breaks from his	trance as Tommy and Darren walk up. 		Happy birthday, Darren. 		Something you want to see in there?	Tommy points to the crawl space. 			(too quick)		--No.	Beat.  Tommy looks to Darren and then back to Cole. 		We're going to put on a pretend		play.  You want to be in it?	Beat. 		...Okay. 		It's called, ""Locked in the Dungeon.""	Tommy stares at Darren.  Darren finally gets it. 		Yeah, Cole...  you get to be the		one locked in the dungeon.	It happens too quick for Cole to react.  Darren and Tommy shove	Cole backwards.  He stumbles into the darkness of the crawl space. 		Don't!	Tommy slams the door closed.  Darren turns the lock.  They crack	smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door.	The BANGING GOES ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT JUST STOPS. 	Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl	space door.	Then THE SCREAMING BEGINS.	Darren and Tommy back away from the door as COLE SCREAMS IN	TERROR at the top of his lungs.  He CRASHES OVER AND OVER against	the door.  HIS BODY SLAMMING AGAINST THE WOOD.  The DOOR RATTLES	like it's going to break off its hinges.	The two boys are statues as Cole's BLOOD-CHILLING YELLS FILL THE 	FOOTSTEPS SPIKE THE AIR AS children and mothers come running down	the hall.  Lynn is one of them.	Darren's mother turns the corner. 		Who's making that noise?	She looks to the closet.  THE HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS CUT THROUGH  		Cole!	Lynn and Darren's mom rush to the door and turn the knob...  The	door flies open.  Lynn reaches in and pulls out Cole.  He's 	Darren's mom looks into the crawl space -- there's nothing inside	except a couple packing boxes in the back.  She looks to Lynn.	She turns around with Cole in her arms. 			(desperate whispers)		Help me get him in the car.  	Colorful murals don the curved walls of the pediatric reception	area.	A spattering of children accompanied by adults sit and wait.	Lynn and Malcolm are seated at a children's play table.  A game	made of a maze of wires sit on the table in front of them.	A young resident DR. HILL takes a seat at the table with them.	He opens up his notes. 		What's wrong with Cole?	Beat. 		The tests indicate he did not have		a seizure.  In fact he's doing fine.		After some rest, he could go home		tonight.	Lynn closes her eyes.  Lets out a tense breath.  Beat.  Malcolm	eyes the doctor as he glances back to an academic-looking woman	standing at the reception room door. 		There's something else going on,		Lynn.	Lynn opens her eyes and catches the doctor's expression. 		What is it? 		There are some scratches and		bruises on your son that concern me. 		Oh, man. 		Those are from sports, from playing.		He's not the most coordinated kid,		but I don't want him to stop trying,		you know what I mean?	Doctor Hill gestures to the woman standing near the doorway. 		Mrs. Sloan over there is our social		worker at the hospital.  She's		going to ask you some procedural		questions. 		You think I hurt my child?			(emotional)		You think I'm a bad mother? 		At this point it's just procedure.		And you should probably calm down. 		How do you expect her to react? 		You want me to answer your		questions? 			(sarcastic)		I'm sorry if I was being vague --		yes, I do. 		Who's going to answer mine, you		dick.	Dr. Hill stares at her before closing up his files. 			(raising voice)		What happened to my child today?	Dr. Hill gets up. 		Something was happening to him --		physically happening.  Something		was very wrong.	Dr. Hill hands his files to MRS. SLOAN and exits the reception	room without looking back.	Everyone in the reception room stares at Lynn.  Mrs. Sloan walks	up to the table and waits.	Lynn takes a second.  Wipes her eyes.  Gathers her considerable	strength.  Beat. 		How long will these questions take?  	Cole lays rigid in the hospital bed.  Blankets bundled around him	as if to shield him.  Cole's eyes fixed out the window.	Malcolm quietly enters through the half-opened door to the room.	Cole spots him.  Visibly relaxes. 		I've decided we shouldn't schedule		sessions anymore.  I'll just follow		you around.	Cole smiles weakly as Malcolm takes a seat on a rolling metal	chair.	Malcolm notices Cole's legs emerging from under the hospital	gown.  Cole is wearing A MAN'S DRESS SOCK.  The baggy folds ride	up all the way to his knees. 		Your father ever tell you bedtime		stories? 		Yes.	Malcolm looks at Cole.  Malcolm makes a decision.  He rolls in	the chair across the room as he thinks.  Beat. 		Once upon a time there was a prince,		who was being driven around...  He		drove around for a long, long time...		Driving and driving...  It was a		long trip...  He fell asleep...			(beat)		When he woke up, they were still		driving...  The long drive went on-- 		Dr. Crowe. 		Yes. 		You haven't told bedtime stories		before? 		No. 		You have to add some twists and		stuff.  Maybe they run out of gas. 		No gas...  Hey, that's good.	They sit in silence.  Malcolm works on a new plot in his head. 		Tell me a story about why you're		sad.	Beat. 		Do you think I'm sad?	Cole nods, ""Yes."" 		What makes you think that? 		Your eyes told me.	Beat.  Malcolm's affected by his client. 			(rote)		I'm not supposed to talk about		stuff like that.	Cole smiles softly.	Malcolm stares at the tired child sitting before him in the	hospital bed.	Malcolm rolls his stool away from his client as he thinks.	Beat.  He slowly moves the rolling chair closer to Cole's bed. 		...Once upon a time there was this		person named Malcolm.  He worked		with children.  Loved it more than		anything.			(smiles)		Then one night, he finds out he		made a mistake with one of them.		Didn't help that one at all.  He		thinks about that one a lot.  Can't		forget.			(beat)		Ever since then, things have been		different.  He's become messed up.		Confused.  Angry.  Not the same		person he used to be.			(beat)		His wife doesn't like the person		he's become.  They don't speak		anymore.  They're like strangers.	Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole who watches	him with unwavering attention.  Malcolm smiles. 		And then one day this person		Malcolm meets a wonderful boy who		reminds him of that one.  Reminds		him a lot of that one.  Malcolm		decides to try to help this new boy.		He thinks maybe if he can help this		boy, it would be like helping that		one too.	Malcolm leans forward, whispers with emotional eyes. 		I don't know how the story ends.		I hope it's a happy ending. 		Me too.	Cole looks at Malcolm's caring eyes.  Cole stares at Malcolm a	long time.  		I want to tell you my secret now.	Malcolm blinks very slowly. 		Okay.	Cole takes an eternal pause.  A silent tension engulfs them both. 		...I see people.	Malcolm just gazes quietly. 		I see dead people...  Some of them		scare me.	Beat. 		In your dreams?	Cole shakes his head, ""No."" 		When you're awake?	Cole nods, ""Yes."" 		Dead people, like in graves and		coffins? 		No, walking around, like regular		people...  They can't see each		other.  Some of them don't know		they're dead. 		They don't know they're dead?	Beat. 		I see ghosts.	Malcolm becomes completely motionless.  Works to hide his shock.	He and Cole stare at each other a long time. 		They tell me stories...  Things		that happened to them...  Things		that happened to people they know.	Beat.  Malcolm's words are extra-controlled.  Revealing nothing. 		How often do you see them? 		All the time.  They're everywhere.			(beat)		You won't tell anyone my secret,		right?	Beat. 		...No. 		Will you stay here till I fall		asleep?	Malcolm nods, ""Yes.""  Cole pulls the covers up to his chin and	turns to the window in the room.  Malcolm is very still and	stares at Cole.	MALCOLM'S EYES -- slowly turn and survey the room.  They find	nothing.  Malcolm returns to watching Cole. 	Beat.	And then we see what he's staring at.  Through Cole's hospital	room window we see the adjacent wing of the hospital building.	Rows of hospital room windows are visible.  In the windows are	patients...  SOME OLD, SOME YOUNG...  SOME ARE DRESSED IN MODERN    	Malcolm hails a cab.  He steps off the sidewalk lost in his	thoughts. Steam rises from a street vent.  HEADLIGHTS.  A CAR 	Malcolm jerks out of the way.  His briefcase falls to the ground.	His tape recorder falls to the sidewalk.  Beat.  Malcolm reaches	down and picks it up. 		Cole...			(beat)		His pathology is more severe than		initially assessed.			(beat)		He's suffering from visual		hallucinations, paranoia --		Symptoms of some kind of school age		Schizophrenia.			(beat)		Medication and hospitalization may		be required.	CLICK.  Malcolm's hand with the tape recorder drops to his side. 			(whispers)		I'm not helping him.	Malcolm stares into the night.  He stands alone as thoughts crash	like thunder in his head.  	The STREETS TURN RED as Lynn drives home from the hospital in	silence.  She glances down to her right.	Cole is curled up asleep on the passenger seat, back in his	regular clothes, a tiny party hat clutched in his hand.  He looks	like a four-year-old.	The sight of him exhausted and still, hits Lynn hard.	Lynn's face drowns in deep concern.  She lays a hand on Cole's	head as she drives.  	The front door opens, Lynn carries Cole in.  He's asleep on her	shoulder.  She carries him down the hall to his BEDROOM.	Lynn lays Cole gently on his bed next to his German Shepherd	Puppy.  Cole curls up with Sebastian.	Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment.  Cole is	curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands.  He	looks like a four-year-old.  Lynn has been carrying Cole's	sweater from over her shoulder.  She pulls it off and begins to	fold it.  Her attention is drawn to the sweater.  She fingers the	fabric of the back.  IT'S RIPPED.  Her eyes move to Cole.  In the	middle of the back of his T-shirt are THREE SMALL TEARS.  Lynn	pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees DEEP FINGERNAIL	LIKE SCRATCHES on his skin.	Lynn looks around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes.  	Lynn emerges from Cole's room.  She turns OFF THE HALL LIGHTS as	she moves into her room and closes the door.	WE HEAR LYNN PICK UP A PHONE AND DIAL.  Beat. 		Hi, this is Lynn Sear, Cole's		mother.  I wonder if we could		talk about your son and his		friends keeping their goddamn		hands off my boy?	The thermostat on the wall reads seventy-eight degrees.  	A few hours later.  The house seems threateningly still.  Too	still.  	An unnatural silence fills each room of the house.	The thermostat on the wall now reads, fifty-two degrees. 	The door opens a crack.  Cole's tiny face peeks out.  Eyes scan	the darkness.	The door opens a little bit more.  Cole's knees are pressed	together.  His body dances a little.  Cole has to pee.  He moves	cautiously into the hall.	Cole moves briskly to a door halfway down the corridor.  Opens	it.  Cole turns on the LIGHT IN THE BATHROOM.	He checks behind the shower curtain, before he turns his back and	pees into the toilet. 	Cole instantly stops peeing.  His body becomes very still.  He	slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes.  He closes his	pants and turns.  He doesn't come out of the bathroom at first.	He just stands there and stares into the darkness of the hall. 	Beat.  Cole finally steps out into the hallway.  His eyes catch a	SLANT OF LIGHT now coming from the kitchen.	Cole hesitates before being drawn to the kitchen.  He moves down	the hall and turns the corner -- coming to a stop in the doorway	of the kitchen.  	Cole stares at the back of a person cooking food on the stove.	Cole's fear slowly fades away.  Beat. 		Momma?			(beat)		Dream about daddy again?	The person turns.  It's not Lynn.  It's a strange woman.  The	woman's face is demented.  A purple gash cuts across her	forehead.  ALL THE CABINETS AND DRAWERS ARE OPEN BEHIND HER. 	Cole's face turns the color of ash. 		What are you going to do?	Cole backs up to the doorway. 		You can't hurt me anymore!	The woman smiles menacingly as she thrusts her wrists forward...	They've been savagely cut.  	Cole turns and runs down the hall.  	Cole runs across his room.	He heads right for the homemade tent seated in the corner with	the ""DO NOT TOUCH"" sign on it.  He scurries in.  His legs	disappear as the bedsheets flap closed behind him.	The crazed woman stands at the end of the hall.  Doesn't come any	closer.  	Cole is curled up in the tent.  He lays still for a moment	reaching over and FLICKING ON A FLASHLIGHT.	The red interior of the tent gets LIP UP.	It's a striking sight.  The bedsheet walls of the tent are lined	with religious pictures taped to the walls.  Tiny statues of	saints surround the interior perimeter.  We see the statue Cole	stole from the church is in here...  This tent is a sanctuary	made by an eight-year-old to hide in.   	A sign to the side of the stage reads, ""The third and fourth	grade presents -- Rudyard Kipling's ""The Jungle Book.""	The parents APPLAUD AS TOMMY TAMMISIMO WALKS OUT ON STAGE in a	villager's outfit. 			(Decent British accent)		There once was a boy, very		different than other boys.  He		lived in the jungle, and he could		talk with the animals.	BACKSTAGE, Mr. Cunningham cues the rest of the children. 	Some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and animals.	Cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey.   	The arched halls of the private school are lined with posted	drawings and test papers.	Cole and Malcolm walk down an empty hall. 		Did you think the play sucked big		time? 		What? 		Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough		syrup commercial.  He thought		everybody was self-conscious and		unrealistic.  He said the play		sucked big time. 		I know every child is special in		their own way, but Tommy sounds		like a punk.			(Cole smiles)		I thought the play was excellent.		Better than Cats. 		Cats? 		Never mind.	Beat.  They continue down the hall in silence.  Malcolm takes his	time. 		Cole, I was really interested in		what you told me in the hospital,		I'd like to hear more about it.	Malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall --	realizes Cole is no longer next to him.  Malcolm turns to find	Cole frozen about ten feet back.	Malcolm walks to him.  He notices Cole's expression as he gets	closer. 		What's wrong?	Cole points to the doors. 		Is something in there?	Cole doesn't say anything.  Beat.  	It's a large shadowy GYM.  Climbing ropes hang from the wood	beamed ceiling.	Cole is trembling slightly as he stands next to Malcolm. 		What is it?	Malcolm follows the child's gaze to the ceiling of the gym. 		I don't see.	Beat. 		Be real still.	Malcolm looks to Cole and then turns back to the ceiling.	Malcolm's body becomes very still.  Beat. 		Sometimes you feel it inside.		Like you're falling down real fast,		but you're really just standing		still.	Malcolm looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes. 		You ever feel prickly things on the		back of your neck?	Beat. 		Yes? 		And the tiny hairs on your arm.		Are they all standing up?	Malcolm glances at Cole.  Surprise on his face. 		-- Yes.	Beat. 			(whispers)		When they get mad, it gets cold. 		Them?	Malcolm looks at the empty stairwell and then back to Cole.	Nothing is said for a few moments. 		I don't see anything.			(beat)		Are you sure they're there?			(beat)		Cole?	Malcolm turns back to Cole, he finds the child with tears in his	eyes.  Cole looks at Malcolm desperately. 		Please make them leave.	Malcolm stares helplessly. 			(whispers)		I'm working on it.	Malcolm gently leads Cole away from the stairs. 	COLE'S P.O.V. -- The ropes and school banners dangling at the top	of the stairs sways a little...  But so do THE THREE BODIES 	It's a truly horrific sight.  A BLACK MAN in britches and no	shirt, face beaten to a pulp, hangs in the center.  A WHITE WOMAN	in a torn white frilly dress -- tears soaking her face, hangs to	the right.  A small MIXED RACE CHILD in half pants, hangs to	their left.  The family stares at Cole.  They follow Cole with	their tortured eyes as he exits the stairwell.  	Malcolm walks from the bus stop over the cobblestone streets in	front of Head House Square.  The streets are quiet and dark.	Night time has fallen over the city.	He slowly comes to a stop in front of an old building.  He holds	his arm up.  Uses his other hand to gently touch his hairs on his	arm's surface.	Malcolm looks up slowly.  Looks around.  The dark shadows fill	the corners of the historic building...	Malcolm stares into the darkness...  Beat. 			(whispers)		...Is anyone there?	A long moment as he waits.  The shadows seem to move, then	becomes still.	Malcolm shakes off the moment.  He returns his hands to his	pockets as he moves through the dark streets of Philadelphia to	his home.  	The doorway to Malcolm and Anna's bedroom is open.  STRAINED 			     MALCOLM (o.s.)		Look, he's an eight-year-old child.		He's my only client.  If he invites		me to his play, I'm not thinking		about how late I get back...  I go.		I have to go.  You know that.		That's the only way I know how to		work.			(beat)		Vincent said I failed him.			(raising his voice) 	Beat.  THE PORTABLE PHONE RINGS OUT IN THE HALL.			     MALCOLM (o.s.)		Please let it ring.	WE HEAR MOVEMENT.  Anna emerges from the bedroom.  Eyes raw.  She	wipes her tears.	She picks up the phone and moves down the stairs.	Malcolm walks out into the hall.  Stops at the top of the stairs.	ANNA'S VOICE CAN BE HEARD SPEAKING ON THE PHONE from downstairs. 		I can't talk now.	Malcolm doesn't hear anything as Anna listens to the person on	the phone.  She smiles as she wipes her tears.  He starts for the	basement door again. 			(whispers)		I thought about you too.	Malcolm turns.  He stands frozen at the top of the stairs.	Anna's HUSHED WORDS RISING IN THE AIR LIKE A GUN BLAST.  	Lynn adjusts the thermostat as she tries to keep herself warm. 		I don't care what they say, this		thing is definitely broken.	Lynn fiddles with the dials.  Cole is standing before the beat-up	twelve inch kitchen T.V.	ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN is Tommy Tammisimo.  He stands in his	pajamas in a doorway.  He coughs. 			(on T.V.)		Mommy, my throat hurts.	Cole watches as Tommy's T.V. mother and father give him a	spoonful of medicine. 			(on T.V.)		Pediaease Cough Suppressant...		gentle, fast, effective.	Cole watches Tommy running around in his T.V. background, the	very next T.V. morning.  He's not sick anymore.  Tommy waves to	the camera smiling and healthy.  The T.V. goes BLACK as Cole	throws his shoe at the power button.	He moves to the dinner table where Lynn is seated.  Cole sits.	His hands go on the table.  He's wearing a pair of his father's	extra large LEATHER GLOVES.  Cole's small hands don't even fill	the palm area.  Cole has difficulty trying to pick up his milk	glass with the gloves. 		Take 'em off.	Cole removes the gloves from his hand and places them next to his	plate. 		I don't want them on my table.	Cole moves them to the floor.	Lynn is irritated, this is a sore point between them.	Lynn and Cole eat quietly.  Beat. 		I saw what was in your bureau		drawer when I was cleaning.	Cole looks up.  An anxious expression on his face.  Beat. 		You got something you want to		confess?	Cole just stares. 		The bumble bee pendant.  Why do you		keep taking it?	Cole looks down at his lap. 		It was Grandma's.  It's not for		playing.			(beat)		What if it broke?  You know how sad		I'd be. 		You'd cry.  Cause you miss grandma		so much. 			(soft)		That's right.  So why do you take		it, sweetheart? 		Sometimes people think they lose		things and they didn't really lose		them.  It just gets moved. 		Did you move the bumble bee pendant?	Cole shakes his head, ""No.""  Lynn just stares. 		You didn't take it before.  You		didn't take it the time after that.		And now, you didn't take it again? 		Don't get mad. 		So who moved it?	Cole doesn't answer. 		There's only two of us.			(beat)		Maybe someone came in our house --		took the bumble bee pendant out of		my closet, and then laid it nicely		in your drawer?			(beat)		Is that what happened? 			(soft)		Maybe.	Lynn just stares at Cole. 		I'm so tired, Cole.  I'm tired in		my body.  I'm tired in my mind.		I'm tired in my heart.  I need a		little help here.			(beat)		I don't know if you noticed -- but		our little family isn't doing so		good.	Lynn folds her napkin quietly. 		I'm praying for us, but I must not		be praying right.			(beat)		It looks like we're just going to		have to answer each other's prayers.		If we can't talk to each other --		we're not going to make it.			(beat)		Now baby, tell me...  I won't be		mad, honey...  Did you take the		bumble bee pendant?	Beat.  Cole's eyes start to water up. 		No.	Lynn goes cold. 		You've had enough roast beef.  You		need to leave the table.	Cole just stares at his mother's expression. 			(yells)		Go!	Cole gets up -- never taking his eyes off his mother -- and	leaves the room.  	Cole enters the DARK HALLWAY.  He gets startled by the SOUND OF 	Sebastian comes racing down the hall and scurries past Cole.	Cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a	couch.	Cole slowly turns back and looks down the hall.  	Cole stops breathing.    		Come on...  I'll show you where my		dad keeps his gun...  Come on. 	Cole is too terrified to move.  	Lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy	out of the broom closet.			     COLE (o.s.)		Momma.	Lynn turns -- surprised to hear her son's voice.  Lynn's eyes are	red from crying.  She wipes them quickly with the back of her	hand.	Mother and son look at each other.  Beat. 		If you're not very mad...  Can I		sleep in your room tonight?	Lynn fights back some tears. 		Look at my face, Cole.	Cole does.  Lynn smiles at her son. 		I'm not very mad.	Lynn hugs him.  Beat. 		Baby...  Why are you shaking?	Cole doesn't answer. 		Cole, what's wrong?	Cole just closes his eyes and holds his mom tight. 			(desperate)		...Please tell me.	Cole doesn't say a word. 			(crying)		Please.  	We are in an antique store.  Filled floor to ceiling with	furniture and knickknacks.	Anna stands with a YOUNG COUPLE.  All three lean over and peer	into a glass cabinet.	An antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand. 		It's Edwardian.  Beautifully worked.		Entirely platinum with a mine cut		diamond and an actual color Burmese		Sapphire...  It's timeless. 		You got anything a little plainer?	The young woman looks at her beau. 		Plainer?  You want a plain ring to		go with your plain fiance.  Is that		how it is? 		No, baby.  Don't get in a tizzy.		It's just...  you're so beautiful...		you're like a Burmese Sapphire all		by yourself.  You don't need all		that. 			(disbelief)		Uh-huh.	Anna smiles as she takes the ring out of the cabinet. 		Why don't you two hold it?	She places it in their hands. 		Do you feel longing? 		Excuse me? 		When I touch this piece I feel a		longing.  I imagine the woman who		owned this, loved a man deeply she		couldn't be with.	The young woman looks at Anna with great intrigue. 		Did he have wavy hair and broad		shoulders?	The young man throws an odd glance at his fiance. 		I don't know...  But maybe...			(beat)		A lot of the pieces in this store		give me feelings.  I think maybe		when people own things and then		they pass away -- a part of		themselves gets printed on those		things -- like fingerprints.	Beat.  The young man and the young woman gaze at Anna silently.	They look down at the ring.  They place their hands on it	reverently, delicately -- like checking for a pulse.	Anna can't hold back her sweet smile.  	Anna moves to the back desk where SEAN comes out.  He's carrying	an antique bench in his arms. He places it down and takes a much	needed seat. 		You don't need someone with a		masters.  You need a wrestler guy		whose neck is larger than his head. 		I need a wrestler with a masters.	Anna fills out the paperwork for the ring. 		What's this?	Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a	BIRTHDAY PRESENT sits on his tabletop.  Sean looks at her. 		From you?	Anna nods, ""yes."" 		Is it wrestling tights?	Anna smiles as she moves to his desk.  Sean begins to tear off	the wrapping paper like a kid at Christmas.	Anna laughs.  Sean holds up a weathered hardback copy of ""THE	GREAT GATSBY.""  Beat. 		It's a first edition. 		Wow, this is too much.  It's		perfect, Anna.	Sean puts down the book and hugs her.  He pulls back a little,	still holding her.  They smile at each other.	Beat.  The moment goes on just that crucial fraction of a second	too long.  Their smiles slowly melt away as they continue to hold	each other.  Nothing happens for the longest time.	CRASH!  A SHATTERING DOOR SLAM ECHOES THROUGH THE STORE.  Anna	and Jeffery pull apart.  They rush past the young man and the	young woman to the front of the store.  They find the glass front	door cracked in a spider web pattern.	They carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk.	Look around.   No one in sight.	Anna stares down the empty street.  A concerned expression on her	face.  	Malcolm walks angrily down the sidewalk.  He stops as his hand	goes to his side.  He winces with pain as he keeps walking.  	Lynn and Cole emerge from the supermarket.	Cole rides inside the shopping cart tucked between bags of food.	Mother and son are quiet as they move towards their car.	Beat.	Lynn leans over, looks at the side of her son's pensive face.	She starts pushing the cart faster.  Cole wakes from his thoughts	as his hair flutters in the wind.  He looks back.  Lynn is	smiling as she pushes.  Cole turns and raises his hands in the	air like he's on a roller coaster.	Beat.	They slow and come to a rest at the bumper of their car.  Lynn	leans over -- sees the side of Cole's face smiling.	Lynn's face shows a little happiness for the first time.  A	little hope enters her eyes as she starts to load the groceries	into the car.  	Cole and Lynn ride home with a back seat full of groceries.	Cole finishes off a cherry popsicle as he watches out the window.	Lynn looks over. 		Let's rent a movie.	Cole bites off the last of the popsicle and glances at his mom. 		Your pick.	Cole stares at his mom quietly. 		It can even have Jean Claude Van		Damme in it if you want.	Cole smiles at that.  He nods, ""Yes"" joyfully.	His smile fades away as he notices his mother fiddling with the	HEATER controls.	Cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home.	Suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield.  It's a page	from a Playbill.  A 1941 Playbill.  It flies away revealing a	woman in a flowing flowery dress from the 40's suddenly walks	into the middle of the street as the pages of her Playbill swirl	in the air. 			(yells)		Momma, look out!	The woman in the flowery dress turns.  Her hand rests on her	stomach.  WE SEE SHE IS PREGNANT.	Playbills stick to the windshield obstructing the view.	Lynn slams the brakes...  Too late.  	The line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and swerve	to one side avoiding a mass collision.  After a few seconds, the	entire intersection has come to a halt.	Cole who has shut his eyes...  slowly opens them.	He looks around fearfully.  His eyes move to the windshield.  No	broken glass.  No blood.  And no woman.  Cole looks out through	the pristine windshield onto the street where cars are stopped	and staring all around them.	Cole slowly looks over to his mother.  He finds her staring at	him in complete and utter disbelief.  Her hands clutch the wheel.	The whites of her knuckles showing her fear.  She has no idea why	he screamed.  	The den is very quiet.  Cole and Malcolm sit around the multi-	colored table.  Malcolm leans back in his small plastic chair --	arms folded over his chest.  Cole sits slumped over the table --	eyes peering out over his arms.	They both look like shit. 		You don't wanna ask me questions		today?	Malcolm nods, ""No.""  Beat. 		Can I ask you then? 		Yes. 		What do you want more than anything? 		I don't know. 		I told you what I want. 		I don't know, Cole. 		Why don't you think about it for a		while?	Malcolm doesn't respond.  Cole watches him.  Beat. 		I know what I want.			(beat)		My goal is to speak to my wife.		The way she and I used to speak.		Like there was no one in the world		but us.	Beat. 			(soft)		How are you going to do that?	Beat. 			(whispers)		I can't be your doctor anymore.			(beat)		I haven't given my family enough		attention.  Bad things happen when		you do that.  Do you understand?	The room falls into silence again.  Cole speaks extra soft. 		You want to go home?	Malcolm stares across at Cole. 		I have to. 		When? 		Soon.  One week.	Malcolm looks down at his eyes full with emotion. 		I'm going to transfer you.  I know		two psychologists that are		exceptional-- 			(whispers)		Don't fail me.	Malcolm looks up sharply. 		--What? 		Don't give up.  You're the only one		who can help me.  I know it.	Beat.  Malcolm tries to stay composed.  It doesn't work. 		You want to know a secret?...  I		was a paper champion.			(beat)		Do you know what that means?	Cole shake his head, ""No.""  Tears fall down Malcolm's cheeks. 		Don't cry. 		I means I wasn't what everyone		thought I was...			(beat)		I was a fake. 		You weren't a paper champion. 		Someone else can help you.  Someone		else can make you happy.	Cole is crying now.	Cole wipes his eyes with his sleeve.  They sit quietly and stare	at each other.  Beat.	Cole whispers. 		Dr. Crowe? 		Yes. 		You believe me, right?	A long pause. 		Dr. Crowe, you believe my secret,		right?	They both just stare. 		I don't know how to answer that.	Cole searches for the answer in Malcolm's eyes...  He finds it.	It's not the one he wanted.  Malcolm looks down. 		How can you help me if you don't		believe me?	Cole reaches into his pocket.  Pulls out a PENNY.	Cole pushes it across the table.	Malcolm gazes at it, then looks up at Cole's pained eyes.	Beat. 			(whispers)		Some magic's real.  	Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement.  His eyes	gaze at the dusty FRAMED CERTIFICATE FROM THE CITY OF	PHILADELPHIA shoved between two packing boxes.	Malcolm leans his head back against the chair.  Stares into the	shadows.  Drowns in his thoughts.	Beat.  THE CHAIR CREAKS as he slowly sits up again.  Malcolm's	eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the	label...   	A tape slides into the tape player seated on Malcolm's desk.	Malcolm hits play.  			(on tape)		Sorry about that.  Hope I didn't		leave you alone too long...  Wow,		it's cold in here.	WE HEAR A CHAIR MOVE AS MALCOLM SITS DOWN.  And then SILENCE.	Beat. 			(on tape)		Vincent...  Why are you crying?			(beat)		Vincent?  			(on tape crying)		Yes? 			(on tape)		What happened?			(beat)		Did something upset you?	Beat.  VINCENT SNIFFLES. 			(on tape)		You won't believe. 			(on tape)		I won't believe what?	Beat. 			(on tape)		I don't want to talk anymore.  I		want to go home, okay?  I want to		go home.	Beat. 			(on tape)		Okay, Vincent, you can go home. 	Malcolm just sits in the shadowy basement.  He doesn't move for a	while.	Then he hits the rewind button.  Stops it.  Presses play. 			(on tape)		--about that.  Hope I didn't leave		you too long...  Wow, it's cold in		here--	Malcolm hits the rewind button again.  Lets it rewind for a	while.  Presses play. 			(on tape)		--like needles either.  When I was		a kid, I had this blood test down --		threw up chill cheese fries all		over this male nurse.   			(on tape)		Excuse me, Doctor Reed is on line		two. 			(on tape)		Vincent, I have to take this.  Give		me a minute. 			(on tape)		Okay. 	Nothing happens for a long time.  AND THEN WE HEAR A SUDDEN CHAIR  	Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins	in the player.	Malcolm's fingers move to the volume dial.  He turns it way up. 	Malcolm leans closer to the tape player.  Closes his eyes and	listens...  Beat.   			(on tape)		Familia...  No dejen que esto me		pase...  Mi familia...  Yo no		quiero morir...  Familia...	Malcolm's mouth opens in disbelief. 		...Jesus Christ.  	Malcolm stands on a familiar sidewalk.  He stares into the bay	window of Mr. Marschal's brownstone.	Inside the window we see Mr. Marschal seated with a group of	older gentlemen his age.  They sit around a table eating	sandwiches and talking.  Malcolm watches as Mr. Marschal tells a	story to his friends.  WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING, but when	he finishes everyone at the table laughs.  Mr. Marschal smiles.	Malcolm can't help smiling as well.  This is not the same man he	saw before.  Life has returned to this house.  Beat.	Malcolm turns and moves down the street.  Each step faster than	the next.  	Malcolm moves to the front of the church down the center aisle.	His eyes scan the empty seats.  No one in sight in any direction.	Malcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath.  He holds his	hand to his side as he winces a bit.	Malcolm's eyes float up to the balcony where toy soldiers sit on	the bannister.  Cole's head pops up. 		Hello again.	He looks down and studies Malcolm. 		You been running around?	Malcolm nods, ""Yes."" 		It makes you feel better?	Malcolm nods, ""Yes"" again. 		I like to run around.  It's good		exercise.			(beat)		You want to ask me questions now?	Malcolm shakes his head, ""No."" 		You want to be a lance corporal in		Company M, 3rd Battalion, 7th		Marines?  We're being dispatched to		the Quang Nam province.	Cole holds up his plastic rifleman.  Malcolm's eyes show he	understands now. 		Maybe later.	Beat. 		Something happened, didn't it? 		Yes, it did. 		Are you wigging out? 		Yes, I am. 		We're not gonna start crying again,		are we? 		No, we're not. 		What happened?	Beat.	Malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up to	Cole. 		These people...  People that died		and are still hanging around.		Maybe they weren't ready to go.	Cole studies Malcolm's passionate face.  A new face. 		You really look better. 		 Maybe they wake up that morning		 thinking they have a thousand		 things to do and a thousand days		 left to do them in...  And then		 all of a sudden, it's all taken		 away.  No one asked them.  It's		 just gone... 		You have nice red in your cheeks now. 		Do you know what 'Yo no quiero		morir' is?	Cole shakes his head, ""No."" 		It's Spanish.  It means...  'I		don't want to die.'			(beat)		Not all the ghosts are scary, are		they?  Like Mrs. Marschal? 		No. 		What do those ghosts want when they		talk to you?  Think real careful		now, Cole...	Cole stops moving.  He looks over the balcony railing at Malcolm. 		Just help. 		Yes!  I think that's right!...  I		think they all want that.  Even the		scary ones... 		You believe now?	Malcolm's stare is unwavering. 		I believe both of you now.			(beat)		And I think I might know how to		make them go away. 		You do?	Malcolm nods ""Yes."" 		I think they know you're one of		those guys rare people can see them.			(beat)		You need to help them.  Each one of		them.			(beat)		Everyone wants to be heard.		Everyone.	Cole takes a big sigh.  Fiddles with his riflemen. 		What if they don't want help?  What		if they're just angry and they want		to hurt somebody? 		I don't think that's the way it		works, Cole.	Cole looks nervous. 		How do you know for sure?	Malcolm's eyes are drawn to Cole's arm.  Peeking out from under	his shirt sleeve are a set of cuts.  Malcolm gazes at them. 		I don't.	Cole and Malcolm stand silently in the center aisle of the back	of the church.  	Malcolm moves around the corner on his street.  His mind surges	with thoughts.  And then he glances up.  His steps slow to a	complete stop.	Further down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his	house is SEAN.	Malcolm's face turns to stone.  He watches as Sean comes down the	front stairs and starts across the street.	A sudden rage surges up.  Malcolm moves towards Sean fast.	Sean reaches his car and enters it.  He doesn't notice the figure	closing in on him.	THE ENGINE STARTS.  Malcolm reaches the car a second late.  Sean	pulls away into traffic almost hitting another car as he does.	Malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street.  Beat.	Malcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and	overwhelming pain erupting his eyes.  	Malcolm stands in his foyer.	Anna is sitting on the stairs, phone in her hand.  She faces away	from the front.	Malcolm's a ball of tension as he listens to Anna talk into the	phone. 		...You just walked out.  You're		probably on your way home.  I'm		leaving this message...  I just		didn't get to say what I meant...			(beat)		I know you're confused.  It's just...		I'm not prepared to do this, Sean.			(beat)		I don't want to be ashamed of that.		I don't want to have to make		excuses for that.			(beat)		And I wanted to tell you...  I		bought your present wholesale from		a friend.  I didn't even pay tax on		it.  You don't need someone cheap		like that.			(beat)		By the way, it's a non-refundable		item, it's scratched on the bottom.			(beat)		Are you smiling?...  I hope you're		smiling.			(beat)		I'll see you at the store.	Beat.  A long silence.  Then WE HEAR ANNA GENTLY HANG UP.	Malcolm leans back against an old radiator.  Beat.	His eyes close as the SOUND OF HIS WIFE'S FOOTSTEPS RISES UP THE   	The house is silent.  No movement.	Cole is in his pajamas asleep on the floor of the TENT.	Curled up next to him is Sebastian.  They sleep surrounded by	statues and pictures.	Cole's eyes open as he hears HIS MOTHER'S DISTANT VOICE. 		Cole...			(beat)		Cole, what's happening...	Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent.  His foot	catches one of the chairs the tent is fastened to.  He stumbles	out.  He doesn't realize one of the bedsheets comes loose.  It	folds to the ground.  	He doesn't stop as he moves through the shadowy hall and pushes	open his mother's bedroom door.  	Cole stands in the doorway to his mother's bedroom.  He looks	over the room carefully.  Everything is still.	Lynn's room is sparse.  No paintings, no accessaries.  A bed	without a frame sits in the corner.  A table with a sewing	machine fills the other side of the room.	HIS MOTHER'S VOICE turns his attention back to the bed. 		Cole, what's happening to you?	Cole looks down and finds his mother laying in her bed.  Her face	contorted in deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep. 		Is someone hurting you?...  I'll		beat their asses.	Cole smiles at his mother as he moves to her side.  Touches her	face with his tiny fingers. 			(whispers)		Momma, you sleep now.	His touch seems to have an effect.  Lynn becomes still in her	sleep.  Cole watches her carefully.  	Cole closes the door to his mother's bedroom shut.  He stands	still in the hallway.  Lets out a heavy sigh... 	Cole's brow furrows.  He breathes again.  This time	intentionally.  Watches as his breath materializes in the	suddenly ice cold air.	Every muscle in Cole's eight-year-old body becomes rigid.  He	takes a second before moving through the inky darkness of the	hall.  	Cole hurries to fix his tent.  He ties the collapsed bedsheet in	a knot on the edge of the chair.  He checks it carefully before	entering the tent.  	When Cole turns around, he stops breathing.	AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL VOMITS ON HERSELF IN HIS TENT.  She	finishes and looks up at Cole with drawn eyes. 		I'm feeling much better now.	The girl reaches out with her withered and emaciated hands --	tiny tubes hang from her wrists.  She scratches Cole as he	tumbles back terrified out of the tent.  The whole tent collapses --  	Cole runs hard out of his bedroom and down the hall to the living	room.  He gets down to the ground and slides under the wooden-	legged couch.	Sebastian is already huddled in fear under the couch.  Cole	presses as far back as he can and waits.	COLE'S P.O.V. -- is of the living room floor.  Chair legs.	Coffee table base.  Rugs...  Everything is still.	Cole holds his breath.  He waits.  Beat.  Nothing happens.  He	takes his first short breaths and watches the room for any sign	of movement.  	A few minutes later.  Cole is now standing in his doorway.  He	stares at the hunched figure covered by the collapsed tent.	BEAT.  Cole makes a decision.  He looks like he is going to cry --	fights it back.	He walks towards it.  Reaches down and slowly pulls the sheet off	the figure.  The girl vomits one more time before looking up at	Cole. 		I'm feeling much better.	Cole and the little girl stare silently at each other.  Cole	holds her stare with trembling eyes.	He opens his mouth -- it takes a while before the words come out. 		Do you want to tell me something?  	A downtown Septa public bus.  Malcolm and Cole are among the	spattering of passengers.	They're both wearing suits.	Cole leans his head against the glass of the scratched window.	Cole's large eyes drink in the passing scenery.	COLE'S P.O.V. -- A dark, abandoned building stretches for an	entire block on one side.  A MAN IN A GREY, FULL-BODIED UNIFORM  		My name's not Sullivan! 	Cole jerks back from the window.	The bus quietly drives past THE OLD PRISON BUILDING.	Cole stares down at his lap and tries not to look up anymore.	Beat. 		She came a long way to visit me,		didn't she? 		I guess she did.	Cole falls into deep thoughts as he stares down at his dress	shoes.  Malcolm slips back into silence.	The city bus slithers through the old Philadelphia streets	working its way downtown.  	A modest home sits on a corner.  Its small lawn, groomed	carefully.  Rows of parked cars spill out from the driveway onto	the streets.	People in suits and dark dresses move somberly in and out of the	front door of the home.	Cole and Malcolm join the visitors as they walk slowly towards	the doors.	A frail, little girl about four years of age sits in a dark dress	on the swings in front of the house.  Visitors say hello to her	as they pass.  She doesn't say anything back. 		Her little sister?	Cole nods, ""Yes.""	Malcolm and Cole watch her for a moment before following others	into the modest corner home.  	The home is packed with people.  The gathering of mourners is	standing room only.  The AIR IS FILLED WITH DOZENS OF HUSHED  		...can you imagine being a child in		a bed for two years?	We move to. 		...I think it was six.	We move to. 		...Six separate doctors?	We move to. 			(whispers)		...the little one's falling ill now...	We move to. 		...God help them...	A FAMILY PORTRAIT HANGS NEAR THE FRONT DOOR.  Two girls, one	bigger, one smaller sit on the ground in front of their mother	and father.  Their smiling faces welcome the mourners.	Malcolm and Cole are standing at the bottom of a staircase.	Waiting.	The front door opens as another group arrives.  Malcolm nods to	Cole as the foyer fills up.  The two of them quietly disappear	upstairs.  	The narrow hall is lined with boxes of medical supplies.  I.V.	stands, sterile needles and pads are in the process of being	taken away.  The boxes are piled outside a closed bedroom door.	Cole stares at the shut door like he doesn't want to go in.  His	eyes move to the large, colorful map of the world that dons the	hallway wall.  He gazes at the many countries and continents.	Beat. 		I wish I were somewhere else. 			(soft)		Where will you go, where no one has		died?	Cole stares at the map and then turns to Malcolm. 		Don't go home, okay? 		I definitely won't.	Cole turns and stares quietly at the door.  He waits a long time	before reaching for the doorknob.  	Cole closes the door behind him.  He turns and gazes at the	girl's bedroom.  There's a hospital bed near the window.  The	walls are covered with get-well cards and drawings from family,	friends, and school children.	Her shelves are filled with puppets.  All shapes and sizes of	puppets.  Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on	a mini tripod sitting next to it.	Cole walks to the shelf and picks up a FINGER PUPPET DANCER.  He	places it in his pocket.	On the girl's desk, is a large collection of video cassettes.	The labels read, ""Puppet Show Christmas 96,"" ""Puppet Show	Birthday party,"" ""Puppet Show class trip""...	Cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the	closets.  He passes the bed. 	Cole jerks back startled.  He watches as the girl's hand slips	back under the bed.  Cole stays very still.  Waits.  Nothing	happens.	He slowly bends down.  His hands touch the floor.  He tilts his	head and looks under the bed.	The emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the	floor.  Her bulging eyes glare at Cole.  She moves suddenly.	Thrusts a jewelry box forward.  It slides across the wooden floor	and stops just before Cole.  Cole and the sickly girl stare at	each other.  Neither of them say a word.  	The room is thick with mourners.  Most are gathered around the	GIRL'S MOTHER, a young woman in her late twenties.  As she moves	through the room to the kitchen, she receives the many cards,	hugs, and flowers that are offered as condolence.  Mrs. Collins	leaves the living room.	Malcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as Cole moves	through the many adults across the room.	The girl's father, MR. COLLINS, a thin man in his late twenties,	is seated on the reading chair next to a T.V.  His face is	granite.  No one in the room dares to talk to him.  He stares	statue-like at an abstract point in the room. 		Mister?	The man doesn't react.  Some of the guests look oddly at the	little boy standing before the man. 		Excuse me, Mister.	Beat.  The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing	next to him.  Cole is very shaky.	Malcolm watches everything anxiously.	Cole stares at Mr. Collins. 		Are you Kyra's daddy?	The man's face begins to crumble.  Beat.  He nods, ""yes"" softly.	Cole holds out the jewelry box.  It trembles with his hands.	The father just stares at it.  Beat. 		It's for you...			(beat)		She wanted to tell you something.	The father becomes very still.  His eyes fill with a storm of	confusion and pain.  After the longest time, the father reaches	and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands.	Cole begins to back away...	The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd.  Cole	reaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house.	The father looks down in a daze.  He goes to open the jewelry	box.  His movements are slow and strained.  He lifts the latch	and open the box.	Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette.  	People in the room start to turn as the T.V. comes on.  Mr.	Collins is seated now. 	Her father's face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he	watches the performance.	The entire room has stopped what they were doing. 	WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS.  The puppets go limp.	The entire stage gets lifted up.  We see it carried away by Kyra.	We can view the whole bedroom now.  The camera is seated on her	desk in the corner.	Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door	opens.  It's Mrs. Collins.  She carries in a tray of soup and a	sandwich. 	The crowd watches in riveted silence.  The father never takes his	eyes off of the screen.	The image of the mother prepares the meal.  She uncovers the	fruit and the soup.  Places a straw into the drink.	And then it happens.	The image of the mother walks to a closet.  Opens it.  An	assortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside.	She pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner.  Reads the label for the	ingredients.  Walks back to the food tray, where she unscrews the	cap on the floor cleaner.  The mother pours some into the cap.	Checks it. 			(video tape)		That's too much.	The mother pours some into the bottle.  The remainder goes into	the child's soup.  She replaces the cap and puts the bottle back	in the closet.	The image of the mother turns to the bed carrying the tray.  She	places the food on a metallic rolling table and swings it over	the bed. 			(video tape)		Kyra, time for lunch.	Kyra pretends to wake from a deep sleep. 			(video tape)		I'm feeling much better now.	The image of the mother smiles. 			(video tape)		I'm glad, honey.			(beat)		Time for your food. 			(video tape)		Can I go outside, if I eat this? 			(video tape)		We'll see.  You know how you get		sick in the afternoon.	Kyra picks up the spoon and takes a sip.  Her face crinkles at	the taste.  She looks up at her mother. 			(video tape)		Don't say it tastes funny.  You		know I don't like to hear that.	Kyra slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another	spoonful.	The father SHUTS OFF THE TELEVISION with his trembling hands.  He	presses his hands to his eyes like they're burning.	The ROOM IS UTTERLY SILENT.  	Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends	and family.  She fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the	table.  It takes her a beat before she feels the stare.	She looks up.	Standing in the doorway to the dining room is Mr. Collins.  A	group of ashen faced guests stand in the distance behind him.	Husband and wife's eyes meet.  Mrs. Collins smiles softly.	Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears. 			(soft)		You were keeping her sick...	The whole world stops.	The mother's face registers confusion at first.  Then slow	realization.  Her eyes glace at the many faces around her.	She looks back at her husband.  His glare is painful.  Rage	filling every cell of his body.  Tears falling faster down his	cheeks.	Mrs. Collins turns her attention back to the flowers.  She	concentrates with all her strength.  Beat.  Her hands begin to	shake. 			(to no one)		I took care of her...	Her words are met with ice cold stares.  The first tears stream	down her face.  The pretty flowers of consolation in her hand	tumble to the floor.  	Cole sits on the swings next to Kyra's four-year-old sister.  She	doesn't look up.	Malcolm waits in the driveway.  Watches them from a distance.	Cole reaches into his pocket and pulls out the little FINGER	PUPPET.  He holds it out. 		You liked it, she said.	The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes	it in her small hands.	The two children don't say anything for a while.  Malcolm glances	to the house, where all movements in and out of the home has	ceased.	Cole turns to the four-year-old. 		She watched out for you.	The little girl finally looks up.  She has the saddest eyes. 		Kyra's not coming back.	Beat. 		Not anymore.	The little girl stares down at the finger puppet.  Cole lightly	places a hand on her shoulder.	Nothing else is said.  Nothing else is done.	Malcolm looks across the two children on the swings.  One	mourning.  One consoling.	Malcolm takes it in, overwhelmed.  	Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop	room door in the back.  He puts an ear to the door, listens and	then knocks.  After a second, he enters.	Mr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a	FEMALE TEACHER kneels next to him and makes final adjustments.	Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham. 		They're calling for the stable boy.	Mr. Cunningham looks around the room and then directly at Cole. 		Who were you talking to?	The Female Teacher looks to Cole and nods. 		Poor Stanley.	She stands up.  The entire left side of her face has been burnt	horribly.  Grotesquely disfigured. 		My favorite student. 	Cole puts on his tattered hat. 		Thanks for giving me this part, Mr.		Cunningham.	Mr. Cunningham smiles. 		You're welcome, Cole.	They share a look before walking out of the prop room and	entering the hall.	We see them walking away. 		You know when I was in school,		there was a terrible fire in this		section of the theater.  They		rebuilt the whole thing.	Beat. 		I know.  	It begins to rain.  Malcolm pulls his jacket over his head as he	scurries up the stairs of the school.  	Malcolm stands and catches his breath in the corridor of St.	Anthony's Academy.	A teacher rushes in the hall with an armload of costumes. 		Has the play started yet?	The teacher hurries past Malcolm and down the hall without saying	a word. 		Is that a yes?	The teacher scurries around a corner.  Malcolm watches her	curiously.  	Malcolm moves quickly to a set of double doors and opens them.	He steps into the DARKNESS OF THE AUDITORIUM.	The play is in full swing...  Cole and a large group of costumed	children are on stage.  Cole holds a broom and wears a worn-down	costume.  He stands to the side -- hidden by others.	A boy in a shiny-armored costume walks to the center of the stage	where a large cardboard stone is seated.  A sparkling HANDLE	sticks out of the top.	The armored boy tries to lift it.  It won't budge.	Bobby, the chubby boy from the party, is dressed in a magician's	costume.  He is Merlin.  He steps forward. 		Only he who is pure of heart can		take the sword from the stone.	Merlin looks to the group on stage.  Looks right at Cole. 		Let the boy try.	The group of villagers on the stage LAUGH AND MOCK THE SUGGESTION.	Tommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume -- he hops	around, clearly embarrassed. 			(half-heartedly)		But he's the stable boy.  He cleans		after the horses. 		Silence village idiot!  Let the boy		step forward.	Tommy turns a deep shade of red and hobbles off the stage.	Merlin looks to Cole.  He smiles a true friend's smile. 		Arthur...	Cole hesitates.  Not because he's acting.  He really hesitates.	It takes him a moment before he steps forward.	Cole steps up to the stone.  He places his hand around the	handle.  Begins to pull.  The sword starts to come out.	The villagers GASP.	Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his	head.	Merlin and everyone on stage bows.  A SILENCE FILLS THE 	Malcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spot light	for the first time.	The villagers rise and rush to Cole.  They scoop him up and carry	him around the stage in celebration.  Cole chuckles and then	starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try	unsuccessfully to keep him up.  They slowly sag and then	collapse.  All the students are laughing as they try to untangle	themselves.	Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable	among of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying	themselves on stage.  	The rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass	window.	Malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby.  Cole walks back and	forth in front of him.  Cole still holds the sword from the play. 		How come we're so quiet?	Malcolm shrugs his shoulders. 		I think we said everything we		needed to say.			(beat)		Maybe it's time to say things to		someone else?  Someone close to you? 		Maybe.	Cole keeps moving.  Beat. 		I'm not going to see you anymore,		am I?	Malcolm doesn't respond for a while.  He shakes his head, ""No.""	Beat. 		You were great in the play, Cole. 		Really? 		And you know what else? 		What? 		Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.	Cole smiles huge.  Beat.  Cole's sword drags on the tile as he	continues to circle around the hall.  We get the idea he doesn't	want to be still. 		...Maybe we can pretend we're going		to see each other tomorrow?	Cole glances at Malcolm. 		Just for pretend.	Beat.  Malcolm exhales very slowly as he gets up. 		Okay, Cole, I'm going to go now...		I'll see you tomorrow.	Cole watches as Malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance.	Cole stops moving. 			(soft)		See you tomorrow.	Malcolm's face shows his losing battle against his emotions.  He	doesn't turn to look back.  	A rain-soaked bridge.  A two-lane road merges to one lane around	a severe car accident.  A rear-ended car has jumped the sidewalk	and hit the guard rail of the bridge.  The driver is helped out	by police.  He's shaken but okay.  Police flares guide the cars	as they crawl by.	Lynn and Cole are standing still in bumper-to-bumper traffic.	Lynn leans her chin on the steering wheel.  She tries to stare	through the layer of water on the glass.  She hits the windshield	wipers. 		I hope nobody got hurt.	Beat.  Lynn glances over to Cole who sits in his seat silently. 		You're very quiet.			(beat)		You're mad I missed the play,		aren't you?	Cole shakes his head, ""No."" 		I have two jobs, baby.  You know		how important they are for us.	Beat. 		I'd give anything to have been		there. 		I'm ready to communicate with you		now.	Beat. 		Communicate? 		Tell you my secrets.	The way he says the words gives Lynn a chill. 		What is it?	Cole takes a long time. 		You know that accident up there? 			(confused)		Yeah. 		Someone got hurt. 		They did? 		A lady.  She died. 		Oh my God.	Lynn leans over the steering wheel.  She wipes the windshield	with her palm to see better. 		You can see her? 		Yes.	Lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights.	Beat. 		Where is she? 		Standing next to my window. 	Lynn looks over slowly.  She doesn't see anything outside his	window.  She eyes Cole. 		Cole, you're scaring me. 		They scare me too sometimes. 		They? 		Dead people. 		Dead people? 		Ghosts.	Beat. 		You see ghosts, Cole? 		They want me to do things for them. 		They talk to you?	Cole nods, ""Yes."" 		They tell you to do things?	Cole nods ""Yes"" again.  Lynn becomes upset.  She nods with grave	understanding.  Cole watches her. 		What are you thinking, Momma? 		...I don't know. 		You think I'm a freak?	Lynn's eyes moves to Cole. 		Look at my face.	Cole gazes at her intense expression. 		I would never think that about you		...  ever... Got it? 		Got it.	BEAT.  Cole smiles a tiny smile.  Lynn glances down. 		Just let me think for a second.	She drowns in her thoughts.  Beat. 		Grandma says hi.	Lynn looks up sharply. 		She says she's sorry for taking the		bumble bee pendant.  She just likes		it a lot. 		What? 		Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.	Lynn becomes still.  Her face is unreadable.  When she speaks,	her words are extremely controlled. 		Cole, that's very wrong.  Grandma's		gone.  You know that. 		I know.	Beat. 		She wanted me to tell you-- 			(soft)		Cole, please stop. 		She wanted me to tell you, she saw		you dance.	Lynn's eyes lock on Cole's. 		She said when you were little, you		and her had a fight right before		your dance recital.  You thought		she didn't come to see you dance.		She did.	Lynn brings her hands to her mouth. 		She hid in the back so you wouldn't		see...  She said you were like an		angel.	Lynn begins to cry. 		She said, you came to her where		they buried her.  Asked her a		question...  She said the answer is		""Everyday.""	Lynn covers her face with her hands.  The tears roll out through	her fingers. 			(whispers)		What did you ask?	Beat.  Lynn looks at her son.  She barely gets the words out. 			(crying)		Do I make her proud?	Cole moves closer to Lynn.  She cradles him in her arms.  Mother	and son hold each other tight.    	Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home.  	Malcolm enters the living room and smiles at what he sees.	Anna is asleep in a chair.  She's curled up in a ball.  In a way,	she looks like a little girl.	Their WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS SOFTLY ON THE TELEVISION.	Malcolm watches himself and Anna cutting their wedding cake.  THE 	Malcolm turns from the television and takes a seat next to Anna.	He gazes upon his wife softly. 			(whispers)		Anna, I've been so lost.			(beat)		I need my best friend.	Silence.  Malcolm gazes for a beat before looking down. 		I miss you.	Malcolm's eyes move back up.  He looks at his sleeping wife. 	Malcolm can't believe it. 		I miss you.	Beat.  Her lips move again.  Eyes never open. 		Why, Malcolm? 		What, Anna?  What did I do?  What's		made you so sad?	Beat. 		Why did you leave me? 		I didn't leave you.	Beat.  She becomes silent.  Anna falls back into deep sleep, her	arm slides down.  SOMETHING SHINY FALLS OUT AND ROLLS ON THE 	Malcolm's eyes watch as it comes to a stop...  Beat.  He gazes	curiously at a GOLD WEDDING BAND laying on the wood floor.	Confusion washes over his face.  He looks to Anna's hand...  An	identical gold wedding ring sits on her finger.	Beat.  Malcolm looks down at his own hand...  HIS WEDDING RING IS 	Malcolm is completely lost.  He takes a couple steps back.  Looks	around in confusion...	His eyes come to rest on the door to his basement office.  He	looks in disbelief at the set of DEAD BOLT LOCKS on the door.	Malcolm doesn't know what the hell's going on...  His eyes are	drawn to the dining table...  Only ONE PLACE SETTING is out on	the tabletop.	His eyes search again -- they finally lock on the WEDDING VIDEO	PLAYING.  Malcolm watches images of himself on the screen...  His	eyes fill with a storm of emotions...	Malcolm looks to Anna's face and becomes very still.  Beat.  			(like he's falling			 down a deep hole)		No...   	Anna rushes across the room to a crumpled Malcolm laying on the	floor.  Malcolm's hands are clutched at his side.	Anna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his	shirt.  Anna's eyes catch something dark -- moving...  A POOL OF	BLOOD IS FORMING UNDER MALCOLM.  She slowly turns him over on his	side...  A horrific sight...  An enormous exit wound on his lower	back pours out blood uncontrollably.	Malcolm's jaw is locked open.  His breaths are long and strained. 	Malcolm's open jaw releases a long strained breath and then	becomes silent.  Anna tries to cover the wound with her hands	desperately.   			(screaming)  	Anna just sleeps.	Malcolm staggers back.  His breathing erratic.	He takes a seat across from her.  He looks at his wife and	suddenly becomes very still.	Anna's still curled up asleep, but tears are falling from her	shut eyes.	Beat. 		Don't cry.	Anna doesn't move, but her tears seem to fall a little faster. 		I think I have to go.	Malcolm's mind is racing. 			(realizing)		I just needed to do a couple of		things.			(beat)		And I needed to tell you something. 		Tell me.	Beat. 		You were never second...  Ever.	Malcolm gazes at his wife.  Tears fall from both their eyes. 		You sleep now, Anna.  Everything		will be different in the morning.	Anna lays still. 		Goodnight, Malcolm. 		Goodnight, sweetheart.	The room falls into silence.  Malcolm sits still across from his	wife.  He drinks her in with his eyes.	Malcolm leans back in the chair.  Slowly closes his eyes.  They	close shut.   	WE PULL BACK to reveal Anna alone in the living room.  			(on tape)		...I think I've had too much to		drink.	Malcolm smiles as he takes a sip.  The guests chuckle as they	watch.  Beat. 			(on tape)		I just have to say, this day today		has been one very special day...		I wish we all could stay and play.	The crowd erupts in LAUGHTER. 			(on tape)		What?	Malcolm looks around at everyone's smiling faces.	Beat.  Malcolm takes his time.  He looks just past the camera. 		Anna, I never thought I'd feel the		things I'm feeling.  I never		thought I'd be able to stand up in		front of my friends and family and		tell them what's inside me...		Today I can...	Malcolm's eyes fill with water. 			(softly)		Anna Crowe...

Do not be conformed          to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,          that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what          is good and acceptable and perfect. -Romans 12:1-2                                                                                      A perfect suburban house with bay windows and a front lawn.          The SHAW family. Caucasian and warm - RICHARD, 34; NANCY, 30;          JOSHUA, 6; and MAY, 4 - eat dinner inside. Richard reads          something on his tablet illuminating his face.                                             Which one are we going to?                                             The one in Orlando.                                             Disney World.

He listens to jazz on his phone. The music stops. He          stops running and checks his phone.                                             Damn.                                   He's right in front of the Shaw's house. He glances inside.          The Shaw's seem normal and content. Andre smiles.                                   A motion detecting security light floods the lawn.                                                                                      Richard looks up from his table to see Andre standing there.          The rest of the family doesn't notice. Nancy tends to May, who          SQUIRMS in her chair.

Also, Tony said he saw a chef                   Mickey and a normal Mickey.                                             He must have changed his clothes                   for work.                                                                                      Andre walks on. It's getting dark. He is suddenly very alone.                                   A vintage creme-colored Porsche Boxter with tinted windows and          a roof CREEPS up on the street behind Andre. It's following          him.                                                                                      Driver's POV watching Andre. His BREATH ECHOES deep and tinny          as if it were into a coffee can. Through the car's system we          hear an English to French language tutorial recording.                                             Pardon me. Where is the nearest                   restaurant? Pardonnez-moi. Ou est                   le restaurant le plus proche?                                   The driver doesn't repeat.                                                                                      Andre, feeling followed, stops to tie his shoe. The car also          stops. Andre waves at the unseen DRIVER. There is no response.          The ENGINE PURRS.                                   Andre begins walking again. The car begins slowly too. Andre          stops again. The car does too. Andre peers through the          windshield but can't see through the tint.                                             Can I help you...?                                   No response.                                             I'm new to the area. I just moved                   here... Down on Evergreen...                                   Nothing. Did I do something wrong? 'Cause--                                                              Driver's POV. Andre continues to talk, but isn't heard.                                             Can you show me the nearest                   bathroom? Pouvez-vous me montrer                   la salle de bain la plus prouche?                                                                                      Andre hears nothing from inside.                                                 (under his breath)                   This is some shit right here.                                   Andre begins walking. The car creeps alongside him. After a          few steps, Andre stops again. The car stops. Andre laughs.                                             Wait a minute. I know you? You                   messing with me right?..Come on.                                   No response. He realizes it's not a friend.                                             You know this could be considered                   stalking and harassment. Plus,                   you're sitting in a deadly weapon                   so that's some felony-type shit                   right there.                                   No response.                                             What?!? Say something then.                                   No response. Andre can't hide his anger anymore. He starts          walking the other direction. The car backs up, following Andre          in reverse.                                             Calm down, Andre. Don't do it.                   Don't let him get to you.                                   After a few more steps...                                             Fuck.                                    Andre, fed up, stops. He approaches the passenger's side          window and bangs on it.                                             I'm from Brooklyn, man. If you                   wanna do something, then let's do                   something. I'm ready..! Hey, I'm                   talkin' to you!!!                                                                                      Driver's POV. Andre bangs on the window.                                                                                      Andre bangs harder on the window three times. The car's          passenger-side window rolls down.                                             Can you help me find a hotel?                   Pouvez-vous m'aider a trouver mon                   hotel?                                   Andre's expression goes from anger to terror. The driver wears          a tubular metal medieval knight's helmet with slanted          rectangular eye holes.                                             Shit.                                   The driver raises a gun with a silencer on it. Andre turns to          run but is shot in the back. Stunned, Andre stumbles towards          the Shaw's house. The driver exits the car and follows him.                                                 (From inside the car)                   Can you please call the police?                   Pouvez-vous s'il vous plait                   appelez la police?                                                                                      Andre falls in front of the Shaw's lawn. A dart sticks out of          his back. He reaches towards the Shaw family. The masked          driver approaches calmly Andre drags himself toward the house          as everything blurs around him.                                                             Andre passes out as the security light floods the lawn again.                                                              The Shaw family eats while Andre lays on their front lawn.          This time Richard, buried in his tablet, doesn't notice. the          driver lift Andre's limp body and carries him to his car.                                                Tony said Mickey's face doesn't                      move.                                                That's right. Mickey's always                      happy.                                                                                      The driver carries Andre to the car.                                                Why?                                                Because he hasn't aged in 100                      years.                                   The driver plops Andre in the padded trunk. He gets in his car          and drives off.                                                                                                                                          The sun rises over the city. Autumn. Beautiful.                                                                                      We move slowly through the small but clean apartment. The          walls are decorated with fascinating urban photography.                                                                                      CHRIS WASHINGTON, 26, a handsome African-American man shuts          the medicine cabinet. He's shirtless and naturally athletic.          He scrutinizes his reflection with a touch of vanity.                                                              ROSE ARMITAGE, 28 - Caucasian, brunette with freckles - cool          and beautiful like an old Summer Camp crush. Rose looks at          pastries through the glass. She can't help but smile.                                                                                      Chris spreads shaving cream onto his face and shaves. He          postures a little then nicks himself on the neck. He smirks;          deserved that.                                                                                      Chris, clothed, looks out his window through a professional          camera. He flips through some striking urban images on the          digital display much like the ones framed around his          apartment. He is a very talented photographer.                                   Sid, a small black dog, watches him. The BUZZER RINGS.                                                                                      Chris opens the door. Rose stands outside the apartment with          her hands full. She has two coffees and two bags of pastries.          Chris smirks.                                             I couldn't decide...                                   He takes the coffee tray and pulls her inside. They kiss.                                                                                      Rose and Chris have coffee and sweets by the window. The small          mound of pastries sits on the coffee table. SID lays on her          lap. She strokes him. It's a perfect morning.                                             Poor thing. Do you even pet him?                                             Are you kidding me? When you're                   not here that dog gets the best                   fuckin' pets of his life.                                              So, how come whenever I come over,                   he acts like he's been totally                   neglected.                                             `Cause he know he's got you                   wrapped around his little paw.                                             oh, really?                                             Yeah.                                   Chris picks up her foot sweetly and massages it. She melts.                                                                                      Chris packs a small bag of luggage. Rose lays on the bed.                                             Toothbrush... Deodorant...                                             Check... Check....                                   Chris puts a cigarette in his mouth. Rose pops up and grabs          the cigarette from his mouth and breaks it. Chris tries to          feign incredulousness but is amused.                                             I'm not gonna have one the whole                   weekend.                                             You quit, remember?                                             I'm nervous.                                             Why? They're going to love you.                                             Yeah? How do you know?                                             Let's see, you're smart, sweet,                   handsome, creative... You're you.                                             Good answer.                                    Chris packs in silence for a moment.                                             Do they know I'm black?                                   Rose is taken aback by the question.                                             I don't think so. Why? Should                   they?                                             Seems like you might give them a                   heads up.                                             Really? Like ""Mom, Dad, my black                   boyfriend is coming up for the                   weekend""?                                             You said, I'm the first black guy                   you'd ever dated.                                             Yeah...?                                             So this is uncharted territory for                   them.                                   Rose embraces him.                                             Baby, it's fine. My dad would                   legit vote for Obama a third time                   he could. Yes, he will want to                   talk to you about it, and that                   will be embarrassing, but they're                   gonna love you. I promise.                                   Chris nods. She kisses his neck and pulls him to the bed.                                                                                      Chris turns on the TV for Sid. He and Rose stand by the front          door about to leave.                                             Bye.                                             See you soon.                                    Rose blows Sid a kiss and they leave.                                                                                      Chris puts his luggage in the trunk and enters the passenger's          side of a shiny white BMW X5.                                                                                      Rose sits in the driver's seat. Chris gets in the passenger          seat. Her car is a mess.                                             How do they even let you in a                   hospital?                                             Shut up. I'm very sanitary at                   work.                                   She moves some fast food wrappers to the back seat.                                             You ready?                                             Yeah. You?                                             Oh, wait.                                   She raises her phone and takes a selfie of the two of them.                                             Ready.                                   Chris puts his hand on her leg, and they drive off.                                                                                      The car leaves the city.                                                                                      We soar over the car as it drives through the beautiful          countryside; a road flanked by woods.                                                              Rose hums. Chris, in the passengers seat, looks through his          camera at the passing trees. He snaps a test shot.                                             How long has it been?                                             10 months, so a year basically;                   longest I've ever been away.                                   Chris takes out another cigarette. Rose promptly grabs it and          opens the window.                                             Whoa... whoa!! Come on! I'm a                   grown man. If a man says he wants                   a cigarette, a man should be able                                    She throws it out the window.                                             Okay, so that's like a dollar. You                   basically just throwin' dollars                   out the window.                                             You shouldn't have bought them.                                             I didn't buy them. Rod... Shit.                                             What?                                             I almost forgot Rod.                                                                                      ROD WILLIAMS, 26, African American, a stocky TSA agent smokes          a cigarette. His cell phone rings.                                             `Sup?                                                                                       Chris sits in the passenger seat and talks on the cell phone.                                             Hey. You at work?                                             Yeah. How I'm gonna get in trouble                   for following standard procedure?                   Fuckin' Gary out here thinkin'                   just because a bitch old, she                   can't hijack an airplane.                                   Chris laughs.                                             Like you can't hide a bomb in a                   wheelchair? Watch, Chris, the next                   9/11 is gonna be on some geriatric                   shit.                                             Look, man, real quick.

She's good.--                                   Rose takes the phone.                                             Hi, Rod.                                             Whattup babygirl? You better bring                   my boy back in one piece.                                              I don't even know what that means                   but yes I promise.                                             You know you picked the wrong guy                   though right?                                             It's not too late for us is it?                                   Chris takes the phone back.                                             Okay, get your own girl.                                             Damn, I never seen you like this.

What the fuck is wrong with                   you?                                             That's it! First girl licks your                   ass and you done. Just...                                   Rod makes a WHIPPING SOUND.                                             You need help.                                             Yeah I do. I need your girl to                   introduce me to one of her freaky                   deaky boarding school friends.                                             I'll see what I can do. Oh, and                   I'll kick you some cash for                   watching Sid.                                             Come on, son! I don't need your                   money. I got you!                                             Thanks, man.                                             You better not come back all                   bougie on me tho--                                    Chris hangs up. He gives Rose a look.                                             What..? Settle down. You know I'm                   yours.                                   After a beat he puts another cigarette in his mouth.                                             No!                                             Last one!                                   She goes for it. He dodges playfully and tickles her causing          her to cackle.                                   A shadow darts across the road in front of the hood of the          car. It's hind legs SMACK the hood of the car with a loud          THWAT-THWAT. It's propelled into the woods at an awkward          angle. The CAR SCREECHES to a halt.                                   Chris and Rose breathe hard for a few moments of shock.                                             Fuck!                                             You okay?                                             Yeah. You?                                             Yeah. That scared the shit out of                   me.                                                                                      Rose gets out of her car and inspects the damage. Chris gets          out as well. There's a small bloody dent in the hood.                                             Fuck!!!                                   Chris looks back in the direction of the collision.                                             Stay here.                                             What are you doing?                                              I don't know... See if it's okay?                                   Chris walks a few more steps then stops. He rethinks.                                             Maybe it's gone--                                   A guttural, almost human, MOAN OF PAIN comes from in the woods          behind them. They watch the woods in horror.                                   Chris walks back towards the haunting wail. It stops.                                             Chris...?                                   Chris motions for Rose the stay. He keeps walking towards the          thicket about 60 ft behind the car.                                             Be careful!                                   Chris gathers his courage and takes a step toward the thicket.          The Moan starts again, but much loader and closer than Chris          realized. He's startled.                                   Chris peers through the bushes. The deer lays there gasping          for breaths and watching him with a black wet eye. Chris is          transfixed.                                             Do you see it?                                   Chris snaps to. He nods and takes out his phone.                                                                                      A cop car is now pulled up to where the deer was hit. OFFICER          FROSTIE - Caucasian - 33 stands near the deer. Another          officer, OFFICER CROW - 40 - Caucasian with a patronizing          smirk, stands by the driver's side window of Rose's car which          Rose and Chris are both back in.                                                                                                So in the future the number to                   call is Animal Control Services.                                   Rose doesn't like the way he's looking at them.                                              Right. That makes sense.                                             You two coming up from the city?                                             Yeah.                                             And what brings you up--                                             I'm from here. The Lake Pontaco                   area? We're going home.                                             You got a driver's license?                                             Oh... yeah.                                   Chris gives Rose a ""see?"" Look as he gets his license.                                             I mean, I don't have a driver's                   license, I have a state I.D.                                             I was driving.                                             I didn't ask who was driving. I                   asked him for his I.D.                                             My boyfriend shouldn't have to                   show you his I.D. because he                   hasn't done anything wrong.                                             Ma'am, any time there is an                                              No, fuck that!                                             Baby. It's okay--                                             It's bullshit, and you know it.                                    There is a tense silence. Officer Crowe's walkie chimes in.                                             Everything alright up there                   Crowsie?                                   Officer Crowe stares Rose down. After a moment he presses his          walkie button.                                             Yeah, I'm all good.                                   He hands Chris his I.D.                                             You guys be careful.                                                                                      The car winds through a thickly wooded road.                                                                                      Chris sits in the passenger's seat deep in thought. He watches          Rose with a new awe. Rose notices. She shrugs.                                             What? I'm not gonna let anyone                   fuck with my man.                                             That was some ride or die shit,                   baby. I like that.                                   Rose smiles at him.                                             We're here.                                                                                      The woods give way to an huge front lawn. A large mansion sits          in the middle. Thick forest surrounds the estate except for          one side which is the edge of a lake. The property feels          expensive and isolated; no other houses in sight.                                   As they drive through the large front lawn, Chris sees WALTER,          African American 35 in the distance facing away. Walter wears          a gardening hat and trims hedges. He works slowly and          methodically.                                              That's the grounds-keeper... I                   think his name is Walter.                                   Rose parks in front of the house, and. He has a pleasant          smile. Rose gets out of the car and waves.                                             Hi!                                   Walter turns and waves back. Chris gets out and waves too.                                             Hey! What's up?                                   Walter waves silently. Odd.                                   As Chris gets the luggage from the trunk, Rose runs to the          front door and RINGS the DOORBELL. FOOTSTEPS. The door swings          open revealing...                                   DEAN ARMITAGE, 59, a tall, balding, barrel-chested, bear hug          of a man. Though clearly smart, Dean has an endearing          cockiness and a bad case of Dad humor. He is the kind of guy          who pronounces garbage, Gar-bahge.                                   And... MISSY ARMITAGE, 56, A beautiful beacon of intellectual          patience. She is poised and warm; relaxed and in control. They          stand in the shadows of the doorway smiling. Rose hugs her          parents.                                             Hi!!!                                             There's my girl! Hello sweetheart.                                             I miss you guys.                                             We miss you, Ro Ro.                                   Chris approaches with the bags.                                             Hi.                                             Chris, these are my parents. Mom,                   Dad, this is Chris.                                              Good to finally meet you...                                   Chris holds his hand out.                                             Mr. Armitage will do.                                             Sure.                                             I got him.                    Come here.                                   Dean grabs Chris' arm and pulls Chris in tight.                                             Call me Dean. We hug around here,                   Fella.                                             Alright.                                             My wife Missy.                                             I've heard so much about you guys.                                   Missy holds Chris' shoulders and examines his face and chest.                                             Yes, you'll do just fine. So                   handsome.                                             Can we get inside before you guys                   start embarrassing me?                                             Of course, come inside, make                   yourself at home.                                             I'm fine with the embarrassing by                   the way; go ahead.                                   Missy and Dean laugh. The four enter the house. Missy shuts          the door behind them.                                   Outside, Walter watches as his smile fades away. He slowly          turns and goes back to work.                                                              A wonderful house looms ahead. The interior is worldly and          interesting; clean and homey. Several paintings of castles and          medieval battles accent the walls. Taxidermy. One wall is all          bookshelf, and there is a fireplace.                                   Above the fireplace is a large hauntingly beautiful portrait          an old man and woman.                                             Wow.                                             ""Wow"" is good. We'll take wow.                                             I grew up in a one bedroom, so for                   me, this is ridiculous.                                             It ought to be. Lord knows we've                   done enough work on it through the                   years...                                                 (To Rose and Chris)                   How was the ride in?                                             We hit a deer.                                             Oh no! Where?                                             I don't know. Down around Lyons                   road?                                             It came out of nowhere.                                             Are you guys okay?                                             Yeah. Yeah. It just fruck us out.                                             I bet.                                             You know what I say. One down... a                   few hundred thousand to go.                                   Dean snickers.                                              Dean. So awful! Dad.                                             What?! Those things are everywhere                   up here, Chris; like rats. The                   damage they've done to the ecology                   alone... Anyway, are we ready for                   the grand tour?                                             Let them unload their bags first.                                             Leave `em. Walter will get `em.                                             I think we'll manage, Dad.                                                                                      Rose and Chris take their bags upstairs.                                                                                      Rose's old room is preserved in the state of a young-minded          teenage girl. Lots of pink and dated boy band posters, a          stuffed lion. A window overlooks the front lawn.                                   Rose and Chris place their bags down.                                             You think they wish I was still a                   kid?                                             I cannot believe they kept it the                   same.                                   Chris looks at some pictures posted on her dresser.                                             So...                                             They're great.                                             Yay.                                              No, they're totally sweet.                                             I told you they'd love you.                                   He sees a picture of Rose in high school on stage in a          production of `The Crucible.'                                             What?! Is this you?                                             ""The Crucible."" I was Abigail.                                             I didn't know you acted.                                             There's a lot you don't know about                   me.                                   Rose grabs Chris by the belt and pulls him to the bed on top          of her. They kiss. She goes for his fly.                                             Wait, what about the tour?                                             ""The tour?"" Are you serious?                                             We just got here. I don't wanna be                   disrespectful...                                             Who gives a fuck? Be                   disrespectful.                                   He stops her.                                             I'm serious. Later.                                                                                      Dean and Chris walk and look at pictures on the wall. Rose and          Missy catch up in the living room.                                             Frankenstein's monster. Only                   pieces of the original structure                   remain; I like to think the soul                   is in tact though.                                    They keep walking.                                             There are seven bedrooms, ten                   bathrooms, three indoor dining                   areas, two study's, two main                   kitchens. There's an observatory                   wing on the top floor. And you'd                   be hard pressed to find a room                   that doesn't serve as library.                                   Chris zones in on a photograph taken in the 90's in front of          the Armitage house. Dean and Missy are younger, and Rose and          her brother Jeremy are kids.                                             That's Jeremy. Rose's brother.                   He's in Med school.                                             I've heard stories.                                             He went through a couple dark                   spots but came out the other side.                   You'll meet him later.                                             Oh, cool.                                   Dean points out the older couple in the picture, the same from          the portrait in the living room; GRANDPA and GRANDMA.                                             Mother and Father lived here till                   the end. They died a few years ago                   now. Passed away within weeks of                   each other...                                             I hear that happens a lot.                                             ""Love"" is a powerful thing.                                   They move down the hallway to a black and white framed picture          of a 25 year old man posing in the starting position for a          race.                                             My Dad was a runner. A good                   runner; great sprinter.                                              Oh, In fact, you might find this                   interesting, he was just beat out                   by Jessie Owens in the qualifying                   round for the `36 Olympics in                   Berlin. That's the one where--                                             --Owens won in front of Hitler.                                             You know your history.                                             Not really. That one always just                   stood out in my mind.                                             Of course. One of those perfect                   moments. There's Hitler on his                   high horse with his perfect Aryan                   race, and here comes this black                   guy to prove him wrong on the                   world's stage. What a moment.                                             Yeah, tough break for your father                   though.                                             He almost got over it.                                   Dean winks.                                                             Dean opens the door to the office. He and Chris stand outside          the door as Dean reaches in to turn on the lights. In front of          the desk two comfortable-looking chairs face each other. Books          line the walls, and are stacked everywhere. Dean and Chris          don't enter. A white cat laying next to a teacup wakes up on          the desk.                                             Okay Snowbell just looking.                    Missy's office. This is where she                   takes appointments.                                             She's a Therapist right?                                             Yeah. One of the best in the                   world. Not a tidy woman.                                              Like mother like daughter.                                   Dean Cackles.                                                                                                And you're a surgeon?                                             A neurosurgeon; was. I retired                   early. Now, I pretty much focus on                   the house and twiddle my thumbs.                                   Dean and Chris pass a closed door.                                             Oh, downstairs is the wine cellar,                   the games room, some storage.                   Apparently a black mold issue down                   there. Almost everything needs to                   get thrown out; shame.                                                                                      Dean and Chris continue their walk-through. The kitchen is          large, homey and pristine. Large windows overlook the          backyard. GEORGINA, African American, 30 stands facing a wall.          She is still.                                             My mother loved her kitchen.                                   Upon hearing them, Georgina comes alive. She resumes cleaning          the kitchen.                                             That view.                                             Oh, Georgina, this is Chris;                   Rose's boyfriend.                                   Georgina turns to them. She has the same eerie smile as          Walter. Like she's masking something.                                             Hi.                                             Hello.-                                              Ah ha! But now for the piece de                   resistance...                                   Dean opens the glass back door.                                                                                      The yard is huge and the woods beyond it ominous. The wind          RUSHES through the trees. Dean leads Chris out through the          yard towards a gazebo.                                             Badminton and bocce ball, croquet;                   we're a family who loves games.                   Two other families have properties                   on lake Pontaco, and they're way                   on the other side. Total privacy.                                   Chris is distracted by Walter who prepares the lawn mower in          the distance.                                             I know what you're thinking.                                             Yeah?                                             Well-to-do white family; black                   servants...                                             I wasn't gonna go there.                                             You didn't have to. We hired them                   a few years ago to help care for                   my parents; they became part of                   the family. Couldn't bear to let                   them go. I hate the way it makes                   us look though...                                             Hey. People need work.                                             Yeah.                                   They arrive at an outdoor patio. Dean stops Chris from          stepping on a dead sparrow.                                              Well, crap.                    Walter!                                   Walter turns to face them. He has that same eerily mild smile.          Vacant in its sincerity.                                             Another dead bird!                    Damn things fly into the patio                   from time to time; break their                   necks.                                   Walter nods slowly. Dean gently kicks the bird's carcass out          of their way.                                             Iced tea?                                                                                      Dean, Missy, Chris and Rose sit with iced teas.                                             Rose tells us your parents aren't                   with us.                                             My Dad was never really in the                   picture. My mom passed away when I                   was 11; She was hit by a car.                                             Oh, that's awful; so young. I'm so                   sorry to hear that.                                             Yeah. My aunt raised me, with my                   cousins. We didn't have a lot of                   money or anything, but she's a                   good person; kept me off the                   streets. She gave me my first                   camera.                                   Rose holds Chris' hand.                                             You two seem like you've been                   together for years. How long has                   it been now?                                              4 months? 5 months.                                             5? She's right; I'm wrong.                                             `Atta boy Chris. Get used to                   saying that.                                             Not a lot of time, anyway. So...?                   You guys in love or what?                                             Mom.                                             I mean, we've been trying to take                   it slow but...                                             Yep. You're in love. I can tell.                                             Can't resist the inevitable.                                   Walter mows past them in the distance.                                             And how did you meet, again?                                             At the blood drive.                                             Remember when I volunteered at the                   community center?                                             Ah, yes.                                             And he really is so good looking,                   isn't he? You'd have beautiful                   babies.                                             I know!                                             Uh oh. Get out of here before it's                   too late!                                              Now, all you have to do is just                   quit smoking.                                             Oh no! A smoker!?                                             And we were just beginning to like                   you.                                             No. I'm quitting.                                             You should have Missy take care of                   that for you.                                             Oh God.                                             How?                                             Hypnosis. Works like a charm.                                   Missy watches Chris' reaction intently. He is uncomfortable.                                             Oh.                                             I thought the whole thing was B.S.                   too. I smoked for 20 years. She                   puts me under once, now the sight                   of a cigarette makes me wanna                   vomit.                                             Of course, I'd give you the                   service for free. You are family                   after all.                                             Wow. I don't... Thank you. Um, I                   don't know.                                   Chris looks to Rose for help.                                             You guys, normal people don't want                   strangers fiddling around in their                   heads.                                              If you change your mind... We're                   just glad you could join us for                   the big get-together.                                   Georgina brings the pitcher of iced tea around and refills          everyone's glass. Chris tries to thank her with a look. She          smiles and avoids eye contact.                                             The get-together?                                             The party tomorrow? I told you.                                             I must have forgot.                                             Oh, well we host a shindig once a                   year for our friends.                                             A tradition. Some of my Dad's old                   social club. Some old patients.                   Some just friends...                                             Drinks, good food, good people...                                             Sounds fun.                                   Georgina has been pouring Chris' drink too long and his glass          has overflown.                                             Georgina!                                   Georgina snaps out of her daze. She realizes what she's done          and starts to clean.                                             It's fine George, I'll get it.                   Maybe you need a nap.                                   Georgina nods, smiles and walks away. Chris and Rose look at          Dean. That was odd. Dean shrugs.                                   A CAR HORN HONKS in front of the house.                                             Jeremy's home.                                   JEREMY, 29, rounds the house with open arms.                                    He's ""Rich kid intense""; handsome and strong with an          unpredictable wildness behind his eyes.                                             Who answers the door around here?!                                                                                      Everyone laughs.                                   Dean pours the remainder of a bottle of wine into Chris'          glass. Their meal is done and they are tipsy. Jeremy pops the          cork on a new bottle of wine as he energetically holds court.                                             One more... So, let me set the                   scene. I'm a junior; Ro's a                   freshman and she has a crush on                   this guy Connor--                                             --No. Mom.                                             Jeremy...                                             No, no... These are good. I wanna                   hear this.                                             Manners, Rose. Give the guest what                   he wants.                                             Yeah, Rose.                                             I hate you.                                             Connor Garfield was on my lacrosse                   team. Huge guy, like 6'3"", and                   crazy, just like ""Looney Tunes,""                   right? We had thrown a party--                                             You did.                                             I think my parents were in Greece                   or something. We had gotten into                   their liquor cabinet and we're all                   shit-faced.                                              No you weren't. Were you?                                             We put water in the bottles so you                   wouldn't know. Let me finish.                   Okay, so I'm upstairs in my                   parents' bathroom hooking up with                   Jenny Richardson. Hottest girl in                   our class.                                             Uch.                                             You realize you're coming off like                   a total douche right now, right?                                             Thanks. All of a sudden Connor                   starts banging on the bathroom                   door, right? I open it, and he's                   got blood gushing out of his mouth                   and he's screaming ""Your thith-ter                   bit my fuckin' thongue off!!!!""                                             Whoa, what?                                             Sure enough, there is a centimeter                   of tongue meat missing right here.                                   Jeremy demonstrates and Chris winces.                                             Ahhhh! You bit him?                                             He cornered me and shoved his                   tongue in my mouth, so yeah.                                             Damn. That's badass, Bae.                                             I'm going to see how dessert is                   coming along.                    Maybe we can change the                   conversation to something a little                   lighter.                                              Yeah, great story. Thanks for                   making it totally uncomfortable.                                   Missy walks out of the dining room into the kitchen. The door          swings open and Chris gets another glimpse of Georgina who          stands with a kitchen knife and wears an intense and wicked          little smile. The door swings shut.                                             Okay, new subject. Chris, Yanks or                   Mets?                                             Ah, Orioles. My mom was from                                              You an MMA fan?                                             Oh God.                                             What?                                             She's right. Let someone else talk                   for a bit.                                             You've had your chance. He's                   dating my sister. I can't bond                   with the guy?                                   Dean exhales.                                             You mean like UFC? Yeah, nah. Too                   brutal for me. I'm a lover, not a                   fighter.                                             You ever get into street fights as                   a kid?                                             Not really. I did take Judo for                   after-school in 1st grade.                                             Awww.                                              Cause, with your frame, your                   genetic make-up? If you pushed                   your body, I mean really trained,                   you'd be a beast.                                             Cool... Thanks?                                   The kitchen door swings open again, and Missy walks back in          with a perfect carrot cake. Georgina is gone.                                             What'd I miss?                                             More ramblings from King Awkward.                                             We're talking about sports.                    Stand up. Let me show you                   something.                                             No karate at the dinner table.                                             It's not karate, it's jiu-jitsu.                                   He stumbles a little towards Chris and tries to put him in a          headlock. Chris stands.                                             I've got a rule. I don't play-                   fight with drunk dudes.                                                                       --Alright, enough Jeremy!                                             I wasn't going to hurt him.                                   Dean is loud and stern for the first time. Jeremy's eyes          flutter, DRUNK and embarrassed. He grabs a wine bottle and          goes upstairs`.                                             And that's my brother.                                                              Full moon. CRICKETS.                                                                                      Rose and Chris make hushed love in her bed. A stuffed lion          seems to watch Chris. He turns it away.                                                                                      Rose sleeps, but Chris is wide awake. There's a buzz in his          ear. He smacks his own head and sits up. A soft HOWL of WIND          rushes through the room. The CLOSET DOOR CREEKS open.                                   Chris' eyes drift to the pack of cigarettes sticking out of          his camera bag pocket draped on the desk chair.                                                                                      Chris leaves Rose's room and walks down the dark hallway. A          floorboard creaks under his feet. He turns down the stairs.                                                                                      Chris gets to the bottom of the stairs. He hears the          floorboard creek upstairs. He stops and turns, expecting          someone to follow him down. Nothing. Chris continues to walk          down the hallway past the pictures towards the kitchen.                                   The basement door is open a crack. Chris peers into it          curiously. A stairwell leads down into pitch darkness. Chris          shuts the door. A figure now stands at the end of the hallway          behind him. He doesn't notice. He just keeps going into...                                                                                      Chris walks through the kitchen. He bumps into a bar chair          moving it slightly. He keeps walking. He continues out the          sliding back door of the house.                                                              Chris steps out the back door and takes a cigarette out. Chris          looks into the vast night around him. The CRICKETS are          deafening.                                   Suddenly, something DARTS FAST across the yard in the          distance. Chris peers out into the darkness. The thing RUNS          across the lawn again. A moment of terror comes over Chris. He          makes out a shape. It's now running towards him. Chris backs          up in fear just as the figure emerges from the shadows and          into the moonlight. It's Walter, the grounds keeper. He passes          Chris without noticing. Chris gathers his breath.                                   The kitchen light turns on and floods the backyard. Chris          drops the cigarette and stomps it out. He turns back towards          the house and finds himself face to face with Georgina, who          glares through the window dead in Chris' eyes. He's caught.                                   Georgina doesn't react. Chris it still. Georgina suddenly          exposes her teeth in a frightening grimace. Chris backs away          slowly.                                                                                      Georgina sucks her teeth. She doesn't actually see Chris at          all. She's looking at her teeth in the reflection in the          window which, front lit, reflects her and the room around her.          Outside is invisible.                                                                                      Chris realizes he's not caught. Close call. Inside Georgina          notices the bar chair has been moved. She moves it back into          its original position, and begins cleaning the kitchen          cabinets. Chris quietly sneaks around the house.                                                                                      Chris sneaks in through the door in the dark dining room.                                                                                      Chris moves through the living room towards the stairs, the          lamp in the middle of the room turns on startling Chris. Missy          sits near him; cat in lap; almost seductively. He's caught;          for real this time.                                              Quick fix?                                             Yeah. Nerves got me I guess.                                             Come. Let's nip this in the bud.                                                                                      Missy sits in a chair and directs Chris to sit across from          her. She pours them both some tea. Chris sits.                                             I still don't know if this is                   right for me.                                             There really is no need to be                   nervous.                                             I'm good. The dude was running out                   there. Scared me.                                             Walter starts early every day.                   He's borderline obsessive                   compulsive. Tea?                                             Nah, I'm good. It'll keep me up.                                   Missy puts two sugar cubes in her cup. She begins to stir          slowly, CLINKING the SPOON softly and rhythmically against the          sides of the cup.                                                                       How's the bed. Good?                                             Yeah.                                             Comfortable enough?                                             It's perfect, thanks.                                              Enough sheets?                                             Yep.                                                                       So, how does this work? Are you                   going to swing a pocket watch in                   front of my face?                                             You watch a lot of Television.                   Now, you are feeling very                   sleeepy...                                   They share a smile.                                             We do use focal points sometimes,                   but just about any object or                   simple motion can guide someone to                   a state of heightened                   suggestibility.                                             Heightened suggestibility. Okay,                   where do we start?                                             Your childhood.                                             Yeah, my memory sucks.                                                                       Wounds get locked in your heart                   and they fester and grow into ugly                   little things like depression and                   addiction. But, they are all in                   there somewhere. All we need to do                   is find the key.                                                             The world around Chris slowly goes out of focus.                                             I guess if it makes me quit...                   Wait... Has it started--?                                              --we're going to go back to a                   place that might be uncomfortable                   for you. Your Mother's death to be                   specific. Were you there when she                   was hit?                                             I was home. I was watching TV.                                             Let's go back there. Hear this                   place. Let the vibrations rush run                   through your body and ears. Hear                   it... Find it... Tell me when you                   find it.                                   The sound of RAIN AGAINST a WINDOW slowly fades up along with          the MUFFLED sound of a SITCOM ON TELEVISION.                                             Okay... Yeah, I found it.                                                                       Good. How did you find out she                   died?                                             I knew it. She was never late                   after work. When she didn't come                   home, I just knew something was                   wrong.                                             Good. Now touch. Feel your                   surroundings. Feel every part of                   your body and what you touched.                   Feel it. Find it... Tell me when                   you find it...                                                             Close on 11 year old Chris' hands scratches the bed post          nervously.                                             Tell me when you find it.                                             I found it.                                   His toes brush the carpet as his dangling legs swing off the          side of his bed.                                                                                        Chris' feet try to swing but are too long. He scratches the          arm of the chair in Missy's office.                                             You said `you knew something was                   wrong.' What did you do?                                             Nothing.                                             Nothing?                                             I just sat there. Watching TV.                                             You didn't call someone? Your Aunt                   or the police?                                             No.                                             Why not?                                             I don't know. I thought if I did,                   it would make it real.                                             Next is smell and taste. Breathe                   in and let the scent fill your                   nose. Smell that place. Taste it.                   Find it.                                   Chris is getting emotional. He breathes deep through his nose.                                                             Young Chris finishes inhaling. The rain hits the window sill.                                             Tell me. Tell me when you find it.                                   Young Chris takes sip of a juice box.                                                             26 year old Chris sips from an invisible straw.                                              I found it.                                                                       Good. Now lastly, you must see it.                   Let the light flood into your                   eyes. Every color, every detail.                   See it. See it. Find it.                                   Chris' eyelids flutter. He continues to scratch the armchair.                                                                                       11-year-old Chris scratches through the wood on his bed,          splintering the wood. He watches TV from his bed next to some          action figures.                                             Tell me when--                                   11-year-old Chris nods.                                                                                       Chris nods and cries.                                             --Found it.                                             You think it was your fault.                                   Chris nods.                                                                       I want you to feel that fear                   again, Chris.                                             I don't want to.                                             It's okay. I'm here.                                   Chris trembles anxiously.                                              Are you afraid now? Paralyzed like                   that day?                                   He nods. Her empathetic expression turns into a sick smile.                                             Good. Now sink into the floor.                                                                       Sink! Now!                                                             Chris' hand has compulsively scratched open the arm of the          chair. His hand stops. His mouth drops and eyes open, frozen.                                                                                       Suddenly, 11-year-old Chris falls through the bed and floor.                                                                                                                Terror. Chris, 26 again, breathes fast but falls in slow          motion though darkness as if through water.                                                             He flails towards a pitch black abyss. He's illuminated by the          fading blue flicker of a large downward facing TV-like screen.          On it Missy sits Speaking to him and clinking her teacup.                                   Missy's voice is everywhere.                                             Good. Good. Sink. Sink.                                                             Chris' body sits in his chair motionless. He can't move. His          eyes are wide open, staring strait at Missy.                                                              Chris continues to slowly fall backwards. Missy approaches on          the screen above him. It shows what his eyes are seeing.                                             No! NO!!! I'm done! Bring me back!                   Please!!!!                                   There is no response. Chris cries. Eventually he slows down          and comes to a stop. He lands feet first on a soft ground.          This place sounds like it's crawling with insects. He looks          up. He can still see the screen above but it is far away, like          the mouth of a deep and expansive well.                                             Mrs. Armitage!!!                                   On the screen, Missy stands. She walks towards Chris' body and          looks down at him through his own eyes.                                             Now you are in the Sunken Place.                                   Missy reaches towards the screen and shuts his eyelids. The          abyss goes almost completely dark. Now he's alone in the dark.          He cries in terror.                                   Chris hears a DEEP HULKING BREATHING in the darkness.                                             Something's down here...                                   No response.                                             Bring me back. Bring me back.                   Bring me back. Bring me back...                                   In the darkness, the SOUND OF HOOVES CRUNCHING ON SOFT GROUND          approaches.                                                                       Bring me back. Bring me back.                   Bring me back.                                   The sounds get louder and louder.                                                             An antlered thing emerges from the shadow. It's head is that          of a deer, but with the flesh stripped off and with mostly its          skull exposed.                                                No!                                   Its eyes glow and flicker faint blue in its sockets. It MOANS          A WRONG SOUNDING MOAN; in hateful anguish. It charges Chris...                                                             The bloody deer impales Chris on its antlers. They both MOAN.                                                                                      Chris wakes up with a start in Rose's bed sweaty and heaving.          He's alone and confused. Bad dream? Headache.                                   The SHOWER RUNS inside Rose's bathroom. SHE HUMS.                                                             He's gotten a message. It's a picture of Rod pretending to          pour beer in Sid's mouth. Chris smiles. The batteries are low.          He plugs his phone in and puts it on the dresser.                                                                                      It's Golden hour. Beautiful. Chris walks through the yard to          the edge of the forest with his camera.                                   Chris keeps walking. He looks through a long-zoom lens into          the wilderness. He sees a bird and snaps a picture.                                   He turns to the house. Georgina can be seen through an          upstairs window knitting. He raises his camera. She's          beautiful. She stands and begins to remove her wig. Then as if          aware she's being watched, she turns towards him. Chris turns          away, taking a picture in another direction. He glances back          at the window. Georgina is gone.                                   BANG. A sparrow slams against the gazebo and falls to the          ground. Startling Chris.                                                Damn.                                   He turns away and is startled even more by Walter smiling          serenely at him about 50 feet away in the yard. Embarrassed,          Chris gathers himself. He walks towards Walter.                                              What's up?                                   No response.                                             They working you good out here,                   huh?                                   Walter's voice is soft and methodical. His eyes remain distant          as though he his looking through Chris. Chilling. There is a          hidden anger behind his pleasantness.                                             Nothing I don't want to be doing.                                             Ha!                                   Walter isn't joking.                                             Yeah... yeah. No, I can tell. I                   never really got to meet you                   actually, up close. I'm Chris.                                             I know who you are. You're Rose's                   friend.                                   Chris stops walking about 15 feet from Walter. Something          doesn't feel right.                                             Yeah. That's one way to put it.                   So, where you from originally?                                             She is lovely isn't she?                                             Rose? Yeah, she is...                                             One of a kind; a real doggone                   keeper.                                   Chris is weirded out.                                             Sorry if I scared you last night.                                             Oh, yeah. Actually, I guess I was                   pretty drunk.                                              I don't remember much.                                             And the hypnosis? Did it work?                                             Hypnosis? No, I didn't...                                   Chris remembers.                                             Well, I should get back to work.                                   Chris raises his hand in a timid `black power fist.' Walter          raises his hand in an open wave.                                             There's another bird...                                   Walter nods. Chris turns and walks to the house. Chris makes          pops a cigarette into his mouth. He is repulsed by the taste          of it. He looks at it. More of last night seems to come back          to him.                                                                                      Chris enters as Rose finishes blow drying her hair. He's          worked up.                                             Hi. Where have you been?                                             Out. Taking pictures. Hey, so I                   think your mom hypnotised me last                   night.                                             Wait, what?                                             I think I snuck out for a smoke,                   and she caught me and offered? I                   don't know. I must have agreed to                   it `cause the thing just made me                   nauseous.                                             Okay. Well then that's good,                   right?                                              No, not good. I can barely                   remember any of it even happening;                   I don't like that. Plus I had                   these fucked up dreams.                                             That happened to me too.                                             What did?                                             The nightmares. When I was a kid.                   She hypnotized me once for stage                   fright, and I had the craziest                   nightmares, but it worked...                                   She wraps herself up in Chris' arms. Chris thinks.                                             And, what's the deal with the                   help?                                             Like... The iced tea thing? Yeah                   that was weird.                                             That, but also the lawn-mower guy                   creepin' me the fuck out too.                                             Why? Did he say something?                                             It's not what he says, it's how he                   says it. You know?                                             Yeah, something about them                   seems... different.                                   Out the window, A CAR DRIVES onto the front yard. Rose hears          and looks.                                             They're here.                                   Chris looks as well. A car parks on the front lawn. A Chauffer          gets out and opens the backseat passenger door. A well-trained          Husky service dog exits the car followed by JIM HUDSON, 57.          Jim is blind and has slicked back grey hair.                                                              Bird's-eye view. Walter helps direct 12 expensive cars onto a          makeshift parking lot on the front lawn. Wealthy guests emerge          from each one.                                                                                      The party is in full swing. The 30 or so guests mingle          excitedly. They are all white except for one Japanese man.                                   Through the kitchen window, Georgina fixes food and helps          occupy four white children by helping them make Hors          d'oeuvres.                                   Rose and Chris get a drink at the bar. They walk through the          party. Missy mingles with some guests. She makes eye contact          with Chris and winks. He looks away.                                   Chris and Rose are stopped by GORDON GREENE, 68, and his wife          EMILY GREENE, 67. Gordon is a cute man with a cane and impish          excitement. Emily is pretty and birdlike. They watch Chris          intently and smile from ear to ear. Gordon shakes Chris' hand          thoroughly.                                             Nice to meet you, Chris. Nice to                   meet you indeed.                    Good grip.                                             Thanks. You too.                                             You ever play golf?                                             Once, actually; a few years ago. I                   wasn't very good.                                             Gordon was a professional golfer                   for years.                                             Oh? No kidding.                                             Can't quite swing the hips like I                   used to though. You know, I met                   Tiger.                                    Rose and Chris share a subtle smirk.                                             Wow, that's great. Cool.                                             Gordon loves Tiger.                                             Best I've ever seen. Ever, hands                   down. Let's see your form.                                             Me? I could barely hit the thing.                                             Show me...                                   Chris does.                                             If I knew what I know now at your                   age? Now then I could really play.                                             It'd be kind of a waste of time                   travel though.                                   They laugh.                                                                                      Chris and Rose speak to NELSON DEETS, 82, who's smiles in a          wheelchair with his jaw hanging, and LISA DEETS, 54, a loose-          lipped trophy wife smiles at Chris in a predatory manner. They          have Dutch accents.                                             How handsome is he?                                             Extremely.                                   Lisa squeezes Chris' bicep. A bit too familiar.                                             Not bad huh, Nelson?                                             Eh?                                              So, is it true? The love making.                   Is it better?                                   Rose cackles at the bluntness of the question. Chris almost          chokes on his drink. Lisa continues to size Chris up.                                             Wow. Um..                                             I'm being too forward?                                             We'll talk later.                                             Oh, will you now?                                                                                      Chris and Rose talk to PARKER DRAY, 60, and APRIL DRAY, 57.          They are an overweight, rose-cheeked tipsy wasp couple. Chris          and Rose try to mask boredom and annoyance.                                             Who even cares about skin color?                   My God.                                             Right. I mean--                                             The world cares, April. But it's                   not a question of physical                   superiority, it's ""What skin color                   is more culturally advantageous?""                                   As Parker drones on Chris looks around the party. Dean          schmoozes animatedly with two couples. He quickly scans the          party, finds Chris and points him out. The two couples wave          and smile giddily. They had all just been talking about him.          Chris pretends to not see this.                                             ""Advantageous?""                                   Suddenly, Chris sees another black guy walking through the          crowd. Relief. It is Andre, the jogger from the first scene,          but he's very different than before.                                    He seems glazed-over with the same frozen smile as Walter and          Georgina, and wears a particularly square ascot and golfing          hat.                                             Fairer skin is has been in favor'                   the last couple of thousands of                   years, but the pendulum has swung                   back again hasn't it..?                                             I'm sorry. I'm going to get                   another drink.                                   Chris walks away.                                             I didn't mean to offend him.                                             Really? `Cause you have yet to say                   anything that's not a blanket                   statement about race.                                             Now, Rose.--                                                                                      Andre stands by the bar and makes himself a Martini. Chris          approaches him.                                             It's good to see another brother                   around here.                                   Andre turns to face Chris neatly. Andre's voice is completely          different from the first scene. There is no longer any trace          of an urban dialect. He speaks in a lower pitch and slow,          enunciating his words precisely.                                             Yes, of course it is.                                   Chris expects Andre to engage more. He doesn't. He just stares          at him smiling.                                             Who do you know?                                             Why, the Armitage's of course.                   We're friends of the family.                                    PHIL, 65, a craggy effeminate man with manicured eyebrows,          cuts between them.                                             There you are. Here, put this                   somewhere.                                   Phil hands his napkin to Andre who pockets it obediently. Phil          places his hand on Andre's back possessively.                                             Oh, hello. I'm Phil... and you                   are...?                                             Chris. Rose's boyfriend.                                             Fantastic. Logan and I know Rose                   very well.                                             I'm sorry, where are my manners.                   Logan, Logan King.                    Chris was just telling me that he                   felt more comfortable with my                   being here.                                   Chris is let down. Andre isn't what he had hoped.                                             That's nice. Logan, I hate to tear                   you away, dear, but the Wincott's                   were asking about you.                                             Ah, well it was nice meeting you                   Chris.                                             Sure.                                   Chris holds out his fist for Andre/Logan to bump. Andre/Logan          shakes Chris' fist and then, realizing his error fist bumps          him like it's the first time.                                   Andre/Logan and Phil laugh and walk away. They join a small          group of people who applaud Andre's arrival. Andre does a          little spin showing off his clothes.                                                              Chris comes back to Rose. He is more creeped out and agitated.                                             Where's your drink?                                             What? Oh, I forgot.                                   Dean projects over the crowd.                                             Hello!                                   Everyone applauds and gives Dean their attention.                                             Achem! Once again, I want to thank                   you all for coming. Words cannot                   express how much it means to us                   that after all these years we can                   all still get together and share.                   I'm reminded of stories of how the                   knights of old would gather in                   honor of a new crusade...                                                                                      During Dean's speech, Chris wanders away from the group.                                             Ignorant shit...                                   Chris hadn't seen Jim Hudson, the blind man, who sits in the          gazebo with his seeing eye dog. He is close to Chris, but far          enough away from the group that no one else hears them.                                             Who?                                             All of them. Ignorant assholes.                   They have no idea what real people                   go through.                                             I guess people only see what's in                   front of them.                                   Chris notices his faux pas.                                              I mean...                                             Heh. No, you're right. And usually                   not even that much. That's people.                                   Jim holds a glass up. Chris fist bumps the glass.                                             Jim Hudson.                                                                       I know who you are. I'm an admirer                   of your work; you have a great                   eye...                                             Wait. Jim Hudson... of Hudson                   Galleries?                                   Jim smiles.                                             The irony of being a blind art                   dealer isn't lost on me.                                             How do you do it?                                             I have an assistant describe work                   to me. You've got something... The                   images you capture... so brutally                   melancholic. Powerful stuff.                                             Thank you. Yeah, I just like                   finding the beauty in abandoned                   things.                                             I used to dabble myself.                   Wilderness mostly. I submitted to                   Nat Geo 14 times before realizing                   I didn't have ""the eye"" for it;                   Began dealing. And then, of                   course, my vision went to shit.                                             Damn.                                              I know. Life can be a sick joke.                   One day you're working in a dark                   room, and the next day - BAM. You                   wake up in the dark. Genetic                   disease.                                             Shit ain't fair, man.                                             Yeah.                                   Jeremy comes over with his preppy friend, Derrick, 29.                                             Chris, we need you...                                             Yeah, sure.                    Nice to meet you.                                             Stop by the gallery some time.                   Bout time you had a solo show.                                             Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That                   would be a game changer.                                             I think we could do wonderful                   things together.                                                                                      Chris and Rose play badminton against Jeremy and Derrick. A          gaggle of party guests watch, entertained. Chris is actually          having fun. He swings big but misses the shuttlecock.                                             HA! Come on. You can do better                   than that!                                             Not my game, what can I say.                                             Yeah, I see that.                                             Shut up Jeremy.                                              I'm just saying, if your boy isn't                   gonna bring his `A' game, we might                   as well bring Mom up here.                                             Whoa, whoa, okay. Now we talkin'                   smack huh?                                   Chris serves the shuttlecock hard. The following rally is          long, captivating the crowd. Chris ends it with an impressive          diving swat. Derrick misses the return and the crowd goes          wild. Chris throws his arms up in celebration.                                             Boom!                                             Yay, baby!                                             See, that's what I'm talking                   about!!! Okay, again!                                   Chris is about to serve. He scans the crowd of beaming faces.          Everyone is rooting for Chris. They love him. Chris scans the          crowd. It's too much.                                             Hold up. Here.                                             Where are you--                                             I'm gonna go to the bathroom.                                   Chris gives his racket to Gordon Greene.                                                                                      Chris walks through the kitchen.                                                                                      Chris slips past several small groups of guests mingling. He          goes up the stairs to the second floor.                                   As soon as he are out of sight and earshot, the mingling          guests stop in mid-conversation. Everyone in the room waits          and listens to CHRIS' FOOTSTEPS above.                                   It is now clear that their conversations have been fake. They          are all hanging on Chris' actions.                                                              Chris walks to Rose' room.                                                                                      Chris exits the bathroom in Rose's room. The bed is made. He          picks his phone up from the dresser. It's unplugged and out of          batteries. That's odd. He plugs it in again as he hears a          CREAK down the hall.                                                                                      Chris leaves Rose's room. A door at the end of the hallway is          a crack open. Chris slowly walks down the hall, and peers          inside. A couple lacrosse trophies and one for ju-jitsu.          Jeremy's room. Movement inside. It's Georgina making the bed.          The door creaks alerting her of his presence, she turns          slowly. Before she sees him he walks quickly back to Rose's          room just as she comes upstairs.                                             Hey! You okay?                                   Chris waves for her to join him back in her room.                                                                                      Chris speaks quietly and frantically to Rose.                                             The housekeeper unplugged my                   phone.                                   Rose sighs. ""Not this again.""                                             I'm trying to check in with Rod,                   and I got no juice.                                             I'm sure it was an honest mistake.                                             Yeah, or maybe not. Maybe she                   doesn't like the fact that I'm                   with you.                                             Chris...                                              What? It's a thing.                                             You think my family's housekeeper                   gives a shit who you're with?                   That's crazy bae.                                   Chris sits on the bed and rubs his forehead.                                             Forget it. Nevermind.                                             Look, I get it. This whole thing                   is stressful. I mean, they're                   circling you like hyenas down                   there. I just don't get why you're                   taking it out on George and                   Walter.                                             You're right. I'm being paranoid.                   I just need a minute and I'll be                   down.                                             Fine.                                   Rose leaves a little annoyed.                                                                                      Rod eats a cheeseburger and watches a true crime show on          Chris' couch with Sid the dog. His PHONE RINGS.                                             Hey.                                                                                                                Chris is alone in Rose's room. He peers out the window.                                             Bruh. What's up?                                             Not much. Sid's chillin'. We                   eatin' burgers. What's up with                   you?                                              Yeah...                                             Uh oh. That doesn't sound good.                                             They just got me over here meeting                   all the family friends. It's like                   they never met a black dude that                   doesn't work for them or some                   shit.                                             Oh, they got you on display?                                             Exactly. Also, I got hypnotised                   last night...                                             Nigga, what the fuck? Oh, Hell no!                                             Yeah, to quit smoking. Rose's mom                   is a hypnotherapist--                                             --Nope. I don't give a fuck if                   she's Dr. Drew up in this bitch.                   You ain't getting in my head.                                                 (Seeing Rod's point)                   Right.                                             Who knows what they'll make you                   do. You know white people into                   some crazy sex slave shit.                                   Chris laughs.                                             Yeah, I'm like 99% sure they're                   not a kinky sex family, but-                                             Why not? Jeffery Dahmer ate                   niggas' heads, but that was after                   he fucked the heads.                                             You think they saw that shit                   coming? Hell no.                                              One second they think they just                   gonna suck some dick, next second                   they sucking dick but their head                   isn't on their body Chris.                                             And thanks for that image, right                   there.                                             I saw that on A&E, so that's real                   life.                                             It's the black people out here                   that are the weirdest. The help.                   It's like they're possessed or...                                             Hypnotised.                                                                       I'm just connecting the dots you                   presenting me with. The mom                   puttin' trances on niggas and                   fuckin' them. It's clear as day                   and that's fucked up. She hot?                                             What's fucked up is: You're the                   first line of defense against                   terrorism.                                             This is good shit tho.                                             Oh, and the one other black guest                   is like the whitest-most dude at                   the party.                                   Rod laughs.                                             I mean Rod, if you could see what                   this dude is wearing.                                             Send me a picture. You are a                   photographer.                                              You should be documentin' this                   shit.                                             Aiight. I'll try.                                             And yo, don't say I didn't warn                   you `cause my ass sure as Hell                   ain't coming up to the country to                   save you from no fuckin' witch                   coven... Unless the mom's hot. She                   hot?                                             Thanks Rod, bye.                                   Chris hangs up and brings his phone with him. He opens the          door. Georgina stands right outside it, eerie smile and all.          Chris is startled.                                             Hello.                                             Hi.                                   Georgina's voice is shaky and careful.                                             I owe you an apology. I shouldn't                   be touching things that don't                   belong to me.                                             Oh, no. It's cool. I was just                   confused.                                             I lifted your cellular phone this                   morning to wipe down the dresser                   and it accidentally came undone,                   see?                                             Yeah, I--                                             Rather than meddle with it                   further, I left it that way.                                              Really, it's okay. I didn't mean                   to rat you out.                                   Georgina eyes get lost for a moment. There's a pain behind her          smile.                                             ...get you in trouble.                                             Oh no, no, no, no, no, no...                   Aren't you the sweetest thing? Not                   at all. The Armitages are so good                   to us; They treat us like family.                                                                                      Chris walks back into the back yard where Dean entertains          seven people Chris hasn't met. They turn as Chris approaches          smiling eagerly. They all seem to share a private joke.                                             Chris! There you are. I wanted to                   introduce you to some old friends.                   We'll do it quickly. Down the                   line: David and Marcia Wincott,                   Ronald and Celia Jeffries, Hiroki                   Tanaka, and Fredrich and Jessika                   Walden.                                   Each couple - DAVID and MARCIA, RONALD and CELIA, HIROKI,          FREDRICH and JESSIKA - waves as they are named.                                             Too many names to remember but...                                   The couples all laugh nervously.                                                 (to Dean in Japanese)                   Can we ask him questions?                                             Of course.                                             Do you find that being African                   American has more advantages or                   disadvantages in the modern world?                                   Chris pans the crowd who all give him their undivided          attention. The silence is long. Chris sighs. He looks for          Rose. She is off talking to someone.                                              Yeah, I don't know, man.                                   They all smile like hungry vampires. Chris is very          uncomfortable with this unprovoked group interrogation. Andre/          Logan and Phil approach.                                             That's actually a great question.                   Logan! They were asking me about                   the African American experience.                   Maybe you could take this one.                                   Andre/Logan is a little caught off guard but dives in.                                             My life as an African American has                   been, for the most part, very                   good. It's hard to be too specific                   as I haven't much desired to leave                   the house in a while.                                   The crowd chuckles. Chris takes out his phone.                                             We've become homebodies...                                             But recently, even when you go to                   the city, I've just had no                   interest.                       (To the group)                   The chores are my sanctu--                                   With the attention on Andre/Logan, Chris subtly backs away          from the conversation. He raises his phone toward Andre/Logan          and the group and snaps a picture. The FLASH POPS.                                             Shit.                                   Everyone turns to Chris. Andre/Logan steps forward and looks          at Chris oddly; His head cocks a little and his peaceful          expression drifts slowly to maddened horror. Some of the party          guests gasp.                                             Logan?                                   Andre/Logan drops his glass and stumbles towards Chris. Chris          backs up, but Andre is already up in his space.                                              Get out.                                   Andre/Logan's voice is higher and scratchy, like it was in the          first scene.                                             Hey, man, I'm sorry, I--                                   Andre/Logan grabs Chris by the shoulders and screams shrilly.          Blood trickles out of his nose.                                                             Phil and Jeremy grab Andre. They have to pry Andre/Logan's          grip off of Chris. When they do Andre/Logan screams          bloodcurdlingly. It takes all their strength to bring him into          the house. Missy and Dean follow.                                                                                      Rose sits on the couch. She's been crying. Chris comforts her          but is clearly traumatised. A few other concerned guests mill          around. Dean enters everyone gives him their attention.                                             What the Hell was that?                                             It was a seizure.                                             A seizure?                                             Yes. Logan's okay. Missy's with                   him now. Are you okay Chris?                                             Yeah. Why did he come at me like                   that?                                             Yeah seizures don't make people                   attack people, I'm sorry.                                             It was an abnormal manifestation                   but yes, actually, sometimes they                   do. The flash on your phone must                   have triggered it.                                   Andre/Logan enters with stands with Missy and Phil to a          smattering of concerned applause.                                    He addresses a group in his lower pitched ""Logan"" voice.                                             Well, I do believe I owe you all                   an apology.                                   The group grumbles.                                             We're just glad you're feeling                   yourself again.                                             Well yes I am. It's quite like                   being trapped in a dark room and                   watching my experiences through a                   window. Thank God you and Dean                   were here to calm me down.                                             It's a simple glitch of the brain.                   Nothing to be afraid of.                                             I know I scared you all quite a                   bit.. especially you Chris.                                             No, I'm sorry about the flash. I                   didn't know.                                             Of course. How could you have?                                                 (to Andre/Logan)                   You shouldn't have been drinking                   either.                                   The group chuckles.                                             As I said I'm feeling much better                   now, but you'll all have to                   proceed without the aid of my                   marvellous wit; the whole thing                   has left me a quite a bit                   exhausted.                                             Of course.                                             It was nice meeting you.                                              Yeah, you too.                                   Chris is skeptical. Missy shows Phil and Logan out. Andre and          Phil leave.                                             Let's do sparklers shall we?                   Brighten the mood?                                   He gives Chris and Rose sparklers and to other people who          light them.                                             Let's go.                                   Rose takes Chris' hand.                                             Anybody need a drink?                                             We're going on a walk.                                   Rose grabs Chris' hand and leads him out the front door. The          party guests in the living room, Dean and Missy included, go          silent. As their sparklers burn they approach the window,          watching Rose and Chris leave the front yard.                                                                                      Rose and Chris walk by the lake. Their sparklers fizzle.                                             My cousin is epileptic. That                   wasn't a seizure.                                             Honestly? That was one of the                   strangest things I've ever seen in                   my life.                                             Also, this is gonna sound weird,                   but when he got up in my face like                   that, I got the feeling like I                   knew that guy.                                                              With Chris and Rose are away, the party guests have all          gathered in the back yard facing Dean who stands by a large          picture of Chris on an easel. Everyone is silent.                                   Dean raises his hand and makes numbers with his fingers:          ""Three and three."" Several party guests raise their hands.          Dean points to the Waldens.                                   This is an auction.                                                                                                Let's go back home tonight.                                             What? Wait, no.                                             I'm just... Something doesn't feel                   right.                                             You mean with us?                                             No. With this whole situation! I                   just... I can't explain but I need                   you to trust me. Let's just go. It                   doesn't even have to be a big                   deal.                                             It is a big deal. It's my family.                   I wouldn't even know what to tell                   them.                                                                                      Dean raises his hand again making more numbers with his          fingers: ""4, 5.""                                   Gordon Greene raises his hand. Dean points to him accepting          his bid.                                                                        Yes, it's weird. There are a lot                   of ways I wish this was going                   different. I wish my brother                   wasn't a cock. I wish my parents                   friends were chill; but just                   because it's tough, it doesn't                   mean you run away...                                   Rose cries.                                             Baby, I--                                             ...I'm late.                                             Late?                                             I should've got my period like                   last week.                                             Oh.                                             I mean, I did change my birth                   control, so it could just be that,                   but...                                   Chris thinks silently.                                             So...?                                             I don't know what to say.                                             Okay... Try any emotional response                   whatsoever.                                   He's silent. Rose wipes her tears.                                             If you wanna go then go. I'm not                   going to force you to stay but I'm                   not leaving.                                                              The auction is flying now. Dean's hand signals are going fast.          It's down to three couples.                                   Dean signals ""5, 6."" Mr. Greene raises his hand. Dean points.                                   Dean signals ""5, 8."" Mrs. Deets raises her hand. Dean points.                                   Dean signals ""6."" Jim Hudson raises both his hands and signals          ""10."" His chauffeur stands beside him whispering in his ear.          Dean points at him.                                   Dean scans the crowd signalling ""10, 2?"" ""10, 2?"" The crowd          looks around. No one is challenging. Dean smiles. Finally Dean          bangs his fist onto his open palm and points to Jim Hudson.          Jim's chauffeur whispers in his ear.                                   The guests clap in a mixture of delight and disappointment.                                                                                      Chris and Rose sit watching the sunset over the lake. Chris          kisses her hand. He hears the faint APPLAUSE in the distance.          He looks in the direction of the house.                                             I told you about the night my mom                   died. How I didn't call 911;                   didn't go out looking for her.                                                                       One hour went by, then two,                   three... I just sat there... I                   just watched TV.                                             It wasn't your fault--                                             I found out later she had survived                   the initial hit.                                             She laid there bleeding by the                   side of the road all night, cold                   and alone. And that's how she died                   in the early morning... Cold and                   alone. And I was watching TV.                                              There was time. If someone was                   looking for her, there was time.                   But no one was looking.                                   Chris cries. Rose embraces him.                                             You were just a kid.                                             Yeah... yeah. So, I'm not gonna                   leave here without you. I`m not                   going to abandon you. Never.                                   They share a moment of pure love.                                             Fuck it. Come on. Let's go back                   home.                                             Yeah?                                             Yeah. I mean, you're right. This                   sucks. I'll go back with you. I'll                   make something up.                                             I love you.                                             I love you too.                                   The two get up and walk back toward the house.                                                                                      Chris and Rose approach the house as the last of the guests          get into their cars and drive off. The fireflies are out.                                             That was fast.                                             Yeah.                                   The guests wave to Dean and Missy, who stand at the front          door, and then to Chris and Rose. Lisa Deets, the trophy wife,          is tipsy. Nelson is in their car.                                              Bye Chris! It was a pleasure                   meeting you. I hope you--                                   Chris and Rose wave.                                             Come on, Lisa. Before you say                   something stupid.                                   Chris laughs. Walter shuts the car door behind Lisa. Walter          stands pleasantly watching the cars leave. He turns to Chris          with the same `ol smile. Chris and Rose enter the house.                                                                                      Sink running. Chris washes his hands and looks in the mirror.                                   His phone SIGNALS a text message from Rod. It's picture from          the internet of witches in a circle around a man being          sacrificed followed by the text message. ""You dead yet?"" Chris          texts back. ""Bruh, you have no idea."" He finds the picture he          took of Logan/Andre on his phone and sends it.                                   Moments later, his phone vibrates.                                                                                                                Rod is on the phone.                                             That's Dre.                                             Dre?                                             Andre um... Hayworth! Yeah! He                   used to kick it with Veronica.                                             Veronica from...                                             ...Teresa's sister! Worked at the                   movie theatre on 8th;                                             got us into the movie a couple of                   times; Rush hour 2 and, um Usual                   Suspect.                                              Yeah. That is him. But...                                             ...But what?                                             This is so fuckin' crazy. He's                   different now.                                             Different? How?                                             Different. Slower... I mean he was                   street; now he's all like...                   white- seeming. Oh, plus he's gay!                                             No, he ain't.                                             I'm telling you: He's gay, I met                   his man. He's--                                             Chris, you in a fucked up Eyes                   Wide Shut situation. You need                   to--.                                   The phone goes dead. No batteries.                                                                                      Chris' phone lays on the dresser plugged in. He's in a hurry          now. He packs his small bag and looks out the window. One car          remains parked in the designated parking area. It's the first          to have arrived for the party: Jim Hudson's. The driver brings          the dog to the back seat. He gets a green envelope from the          glove compartment and brings it to Missy at the front door.          She accepts it silently.                                   The driver drives away without Jim.                                   Chris goes to leave Rose's room. Her closet creaks open. Chris          sees a framed picture of Rose inside. Not quite knowing what          he's looking for, he goes to the closet. The picture is a          frightening one. Rose is one of the witches in a high school          production of Macbeth. It's on top of a red shoebox that has          the drama/comedy masks drawn on top of it.                                   He takes it off of the shelf. Inside is a pile of pictures. On          top is one of Rose dressed as Juliet in a high school play.                                    The next one is of Rose at 13 playing Ms. Hannigan in Annie.          Chris flips through a few more pictures of Rose at different          ages in different class plays.                                   Finally Chris comes upon a photo printed from a computer. It's          a selfie of her and some other black guy. The picture is          almost identical to the one she took with Chris before the          ride up. Under the image are written the words. ""X-mas 2014""          Stunned, Chris flips to the next picture. It's another          romantic selfie, this time with a different black guy.          Underneath, the caption ""Memorial Day 2013""                                   He continues flipping through the stack of pictures of Rose          with 8 different black guys. The last one is a picture of Rose          with Walter. In it she kisses Walter's cheek intimately.          ""Thanksgiving 2009"" Walter looks different in the picture. He          isn't smiling vaguely; he's got swagger.                                             What are you doing?                                   Rose stands there in the doorway behind him. Chris subtly          drops the pictures back in the shoebox.                                             Um... Looking for my camera.                                   Rose points to her desk. He grabs his bag and the camera.                                             Where are the keys..? I gotta put                   our bags in the trunk.                                             Walter can do that.                                             Nah, I'll do it.                                   Rose is truly distant for the first time. A different person.          She is methodical and emotionless. The jig is up, and now she          is now phoning it in.                                             I was just looking for them. I'm                   such a mess, will you help me?                                   Chris walks out the door, leaving Rose.                                                              Rose follows Chris down the stairs.                                             Chris... What's wrong?                                             Nothing.                                   Jeremy stands near the front door twirling his lacrosse stick.          Dean and Missy sit in the living room.                                             Where are you going? The party's                   just getting started.                                             I'm going to the car; see if we                   left the keys in there.                                             I just made tea.                                             I'm good.                                   The family is silent. Missy's glare pierces Chris. He avoids          eye contact.                                             Oh, I know where they are. In my                   bag. Duh.                                             You're leaving us.                                             Yeah.                                             Is something wrong?                                             No. Well, yeah... Um.                                             His dog is not well. He needs to                   go to the vet first thing in the                                    Dean hits play on the sound system. Darkly valiant classical          music begins. He standing in front of the fireplace.                                    Lost in the fire, Dean begins conducting the music.                                             What is your purpose, Chris?                                             What?                                             In life? What is your purpose..?                                             Right now, it's finding the keys.                                             We've been looking for our purpose                   for such a long time. Fire has                   mesmerized man since the Stone                   Age. It is a reflection of our                   impermanence in the world. Fire is                   born, it breathes and then it                   dies.                                             Rose...                                   Rose lamely rummages through her bag.                                             I'm looking.                                             Rose, what is this shit?!                                             There's a reason we worship the                   Sun, Chris. He who lights the way                   through the darkness of life. He                   in all his glory was around long                   before us and will be here long                   after we are gone, but he too will                   die some day! That's right even                   the Sun God will die. It is no                   less mortal than we, but it                   inspires us to defy it! So what do                   we do?--                                             --Rose.--                                             --What do we do?! We baptize                   ourselves in the firewater!                                              We bathe in his reflection, for                   one chance to emerge having defied                   death!                                             You'd take that baptism wouldn't                   you, Chris? The baptism of                   immortality?                                             I was raised Episcopalian.                                   Chris starts toward the door, but his path is blocked by          Jeremy swinging at air.                                             Whoa! Be careful, bro.                                             Don't hurt him, Jeremy.                                             What? I'm not doing anything.                                             Listen, Chris--                                             --I don't know what you're saying!                                                 (Through tears of joyous                    I'm saying that we've found OUR                   PURPOSE!!! There must be a                   sacrifice! Sacrifice is essential                   for the righteous to achieve our                   true potential. A vessel must be                   comprised. A host must be born!!!                                             Rose! The keys!!!                                   Rose backs away.                                             Oh baby... You know I can't give                   you the keys.                                   Chris makes a run for the door. Missy CLINKS the cup with her                                                              The world instantly blurs around Chris. He begins to fall. He          sees a flash.                                                                                      Chris falls through the abyss towards `The Sunken Place' again          just like when he was hypnotized. The blue screen above him          shows what his open eyes see. It's his own perspective falling          to the floor. CRASH! The screen now shows the living room          ceiling. Jeremy leans over him.                                             Oh shit!                                             Is he hurt?                                             What the fuck?                                             Did you see him drop?                                             He hit his head pretty good.                                             It's just a bump. He's fine.                                             Rose!!!                                             Why do you push them, Dean?                                             It's important to me that they                   acknowledge the purpose.                                             Why do you think he ran?                                             Rose gave it away.                                             He already knew.                                             Take him to the games room.                   Jeremy, get the legs. Dean, help                   him.                                              I can take him alone.                                             No. We've already damaged him                   enough. Dean, please.                                   Chris continues to fall slowly further from the screen above          which continues to show his body's POV as it is being lifted          by Dean and Jeremy and carried out of the room.                                             Rose!? No, no, no, no. Shit,                   shit...                                             You're going to drop him.                                             No I'm not.                                             Be careful what you say, everyone.                   He can hear every word.                                             Rose!!!!                                             It doesn't matter any more does                   it?                                   A DOOR CREAKS open. Chris' body is taken downstairs into the          darkness. The screen in the abyss goes dark.                                             No!! Help!!! Help!!!!! Help!!!!!!                                   Chris sinks, his screams are enveloped by the pitch back.                                                                                      Rod sits by the bag x-ray but stares into space distracted by          thought. GARY (40) a condescending supervisor snaps his          fingers in Rod's face.                                             Hey... two strikes. Go take 10;                   get it together.                                                              Rod smokes a cigarette and dials Chris.                                             It's Chris. I'm away from my phone                   or I just don't want to talk to                   you.                                             Sup? Making sure you good. I                   thought you were coming back                   yesterday, so hopefully you home                   already and just sleeping or some                   shit. Aiight. Let me know.                                                                                      Rod opens the door. Sid wags his tail hungrily.                                                                                      Rod opens dog food while he calls Chris.                                             Hey, it's Chris. I'm away from my                   phone or I just don't want to talk                                    Rod hangs up. He places Sid's bowl down. Sid doesn't eat.          Instead Sid looks back up at Rod and WHINES.                                             Yeah... me too.                                                                                      Rod sits at Chris' desk in front of his laptop. Sid sits on          Rod's lap. Rod types ""Andre Hayworth"" into the search engine.          Images of Andre come up.                                   Rod finds an article entitled: ""What Happened to Andre          Hayworth?"" under in bold ""Brooklyn Native Goes Missing In          Evergreen Hallow.""                                   Rod's eyes go wide.                                             Oh shit.                                                              Chris wakes up with a bump on his head. In front of Chris, a          deer's head is mounted above an old-school floor-standing          television. Behind him, a goat's head is mounted under a          taxidermy owl, wings spread.                                   His arms and legs fastened to a leather upholstered chair in          the middle of a small dark room full of board games.                                   Chris pulls at the straps that bind his arms and legs.                                             Hey. Hey!!!! Rose!!!!                                   Chris tries to gnaw at the harnesses, but they are too thick.                                             Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh                   shit. The fuck?!?!! Y'all are                   psycho!? Is that it? Let me out of                   this chair.                                   Chris looks around.                                             People know I'm here. I told a                   bunch of people where I was going!                   You don't know me!!! You don't                   know me!!!! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!!!                                   The television screen turns on. Chris watches intently. The          image of deer walking through woods comes on. The words                                   ""YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND by James Taylor"" comes up as the song          starts to PLAY. It's a forest-themed karaoke video.                                   Chris is confused. He tries to slip out of the binds again          drawing blood on his wrists.                                                                                      Sid wakes Rod up with a lick to the face. He's on the sofa.                                                                                      Rod sits at a desk with Sid on his lap.. DETECTIVE LATOYA 50,          African American enters. She looks like she's been doing this          way too long. She speaks to someone outside her office.                                             ...Then he should've gone back up                   there and made sure everything was                   accounted for.                                              `Cause hey, look; how about this?                   If you record the evidence, you're                   responsible for it.                                   Latoya shuts the door and sits at her desk. She begins opening          and eating a bag of cashews.                                             Hello Mr...                                             Williams... Rod Williams...                                             From the TSA?                                             Yes Ma'am.                                             You know that TSA issues should be                   brought to your authorizing                   officer, right?                                             It's not TSA business, ma'am.                                             Please don't call me ""ma'am,"" or                   we're not gonna get along. How can                   I help you, Rod Williams from the                                              Here it is: My boy Chris has been                   missing for two days.                                             Your son is missing?                                             No, sorry, not my son, my boy.                   He's my friend. He's 26. His name                   is Chris... Washington...                                   He gives her time to write the name which she doesn't do. She          just stares at him.                                             He left town on Friday with his                   girlfriend Rose... Armitage...                   She's white.                                              That's four days ago.                                             Yeah, I mean he's only been                   MISSING for two days. He was                                              --I'm gonna stop you right there.                   Now you know the minimum amount of                   time without contact before you                   can file a missing persons report                                              --Three days I know, but I have                   reason to believe he's been                   abducted.                                             Go on.                                             Chris was set to come back home on                   Sunday. I was watching his dog                   Sid.                                   Latoya points to Sid                                             That's Sid.                                             Yup. Cute right? Now look...                                   Rod takes out his phone and scrolls to a photo of Andre.                                             Chris sent me this which he took                   at the girlfriend's parents house.                   That's Andre Hayworth, a guy we                   knew from back in the day. Come to                   find out he went missing 6 months                   ago in an affluent suburb upstate.                                             Don't look too missing to me.                                             Well that's the thing. We found                   him and now, according to Chris,                   he's gay with a different                   personality.                                              Gay?                                             But he didn't used to be.                                             I think he might just argue with                   you on that one.                                             I know what I'm about to say is                   gonna sound crazy.                                             Try me.                                             You ready for this...? I think                   this family is abducting black                   people and brainwashing them to                   work for them as sex slaves and                   shit... Sorry.                                             ...Brainwashing?                                             Yeah.                                             Hold on one second.                       (over her intercom)                   Garcia, Frostie, get in here a                   second.                    I want you to tell these officers                   exactly what you just told me.                                                                                      Two detectives, Garcia, 37, and Drake, 43, stand behind          Latoya.                                             ...See, I don't know if the                   hypnosis makes you a slave or if                   just turns you gay or what, but                   they already got two brothers that                   we know of, and who knows how many                   more there could be.                                   The officers are all riveted... Then... All three detectives          laugh. Rod is not being taken the slightest bit seriously.                                                  (to her colleagues)                   So, I don't want none of you                   sayin' I don't do nothin' for                   you... White girls'll get ya every                   time!                                   They laugh even harder.                                                                                      The SONG PLAYS Over and over. Chris is too weak to struggle.                                             Is this the only song you got?                                                                                      The SONG ends. It BEGINS again.                                             Okay. Okay! What do you want? You                   tryin' to break me? I won't say                   shit!! I'll just... I'll do what                   you say, just answer me!                                                                                      Rod sits by the window with Sid. He looks out over rooftops          and thinks. He picks up his phone and calls Chris again. He          knows Chris won't answer. Then--                                             Hello?                                   Rod is taken off guard. He almost drops his phone.                                             Chris?                                             Yo. Um, Rose? It's Rod.                                             Hi.                                             Where's Chris?                                                                                       Rose stands by the dining table on Chris' phone. Rose starts          to cry.                                             He left like two days ago.                                             He left?                                             We got in a fight. He got all                   paranoid and flipped out; He took                   a cab home. He forgot his phone.                   Wait... You haven't seen him?                                             No. He never made it back here.                                             Oh my God.                                             I've been calling. I went to the                   police and everything.                                   Rose is silent.                                             Hello?                                             What did you say?                                             I told them he was missing.                                             Uh huh...                                             So... What cab company did he use?                                             I don't know. A local one I'm                   guessing. Maybe uber? Wait, I'm so                   confused...                                             Hold on a second.                                   Rod knows she had something to do with it.                                    He opens up `Garage Band' on Chris' computer and puts the          phone on speaker, recording her.                                             So, last time Chris and I talked,                   he told me your mom hypnotized                   him?                                   Rose is silent. Then...                                             Rod, just stop.                                             Huh?                                             I know why you're calling.                                             Why is that?                                   We now see Rose's family standing in the living room behind          her. They watch her operate.                                             Come on. I mean, it's kind of                   obvious.                                             What?                                             That there's something between us.                                             No. I'm calling about Chris.                                             We'd all go out drinking... I                   remember you looking at me.                                   Rod is put on the spot. He becomes extremely uncomfortable.                                             That's my best friend. If you did                                              I know you think about fucking me,                   Rod.                                             --No. You crazy... No.                                    Rod hangs up in a panic. He looks at Sid helplessly.                                   Rose's flirtacious smile goes blank. She places the phone on          the dining room table and looks back at her family. They watch          in approval.                                                                                      ""You've Got A Friend"" plays.                                   Chris, still strapped to the chair, hangs his head in          resignation. Eyes shut, he sings along.                                               ...Winter, Spring, Summer and                     Fall, all you need to do is call.                     And I'll be there. You got a                     friend. Ain't it good to know                     you've got a friend. Ain't it good                     to know you've got a friend. Oh,                     yeah, yeah, you've got a friend.                                   The song is over. After a moment. Chris begins to sing the          opening guitar lick. He gets a couple notes before realizing          he's singing alone.                                   The television in front of Chris flickers off and then back on          to the image of a tea cup comes into focus on the screen. A          spoon comes into the shot and clinks the side of the cup.                                                                                       Before he can react, Chris falls asleep.                                   Later...                                   Chris wakes up bald. Static snow clicks fills the TV lighting          the room. The image clicks to that of...                                                                                      Jim Hudson, also shaven, sits on a hospital bed. And faces          Chris through the television.                                               Hello Chris. How's it going...?                     You can answer. There's an                     intercom in the room; I can hear                     you.                                     I need water.                                    Yeah, sorry about that. If it          makes you feel any better, I'm          thirsty too.                                    I need to get outta here.                                    Right. So, the reason I am talking          to you now is so you can          understand what is happening to          you. I guess your `understanding'          it raises the success rate of this          whole thing. Not even sure I          `understand' it.                                    Where's Rose?                                    Hot isn't she? Hot voice anyway,          you dirty dog. You're one of the          lucky one's. The son Jeremy's          wrangling method sounds way less          pleasant.                                    Is this some kind of a game to          you?                                    They asked me for my favorite          song, which was hard; I like all          types of music. Turns out they          really just needed one I knew all          the words to: I went with James          Taylor's ""You Got a Friend."" I          hope it hasn't been too torturous;          that wasn't the point. The point          is that you learn it, and for us          to have that knowledge in common.                                    Who the fuck are you people?                                    Oh right. Okay, let me back up and          give you the cliff notes. The          Armitages and I are a part of a          society. A pretty extraordinary          society actually.                                              One whose sole purpose for many                   many years has been a search for a                   very powerful object. Armitage                   lineage redefined the nature of                   that search. They proved that the                   power didn't just exist in that                   object; You see, with science the                   Armitage's created a miracle.                                             You hypnotize me? Break my will..?                   Make me a slave like the others?                   This is some crazy racist shit.                                             No. Not racist, Chris. We don't                   hate you. We want to be you... You                   are not going to be a slave.                   You're going to be a vessel.                                             Wait, what?                                             Missy's hypnosis was merely to                   sedate you. Oh, that and to                   prepare you psychologically...                                             For what?                                   Jim smiles.                                             For the procedure.                                             What's the procedure?                                             Are you ready...? Drum roll                   please. Brain transplantation.                   Some say it could never be done;                                             They experimented for centuries,                   but it turned out re-linking the                   brain to a foreign central nervous                   system was impossible. The nerve                   connections are far too intricate                   and delicate.                                              What the fuck?                                             Dean's the only guy who really                   gets the science. He's the one who                   discovered that full brain                   transplantation isn't actually                   necessary to transfer the soul,                   and that partial brain                   transplantation solves the little                   nerve ending problem.                                             No.                                   Jim holds up a Color coded diagram of the human Brain. There          is a big red part that takes up 80% of the image. The other          20% is blue and located near the lower back of his skull.                                             Okay so... You see the blue part?                   That's the piece of your brain                   that's all rooted in the nervous                   system. So that stays; keeping                   those tricky little connections                   intact. The rest is discarded.                   Then they'll remove the red part                   of my brain from my skull and put                   in yours. Your ""blue"" and my ""red""                   basically absorb each other. And                   apparently the brain heals                   surprisingly fast, so assuming                   everything goes as planned, we                   should be up and functioning in a                   couple weeks.                                             And my brain?                                             Your red part? It'll be discarded,                   but don't worry. You wont be gone.                   Well not completely. You'll still                   be in there somewhere; limited                   consciousness of course;                                             you'll still be able to see and                   hear but your existence will be as                   a passenger... an audience. You                   will live in...                                              ...The Sunken Place.                                             Yes. That's what she calls it.                   Good! So you understand, I'll                   control the motor functions, the                   will of our body, effectively                                              Me... You will be me.                                             As far as the world is concerned.                   It's still a pretty new operation.                   Some kinks. We're supposed to stay                   away from flashes of light for                   example. They can trigger a                   ""momentary lapse in control of                   motor functions...""                                             Why black people?                                   Jim is disappointed in the question.                                             Well, because you get the highest                   bids. For the last decade or so                   anyway. I wish it was less simple                   than that, but it's not. You're in                   fashion, baby!                                   Final hope sinks from. Chris shoulders.                                             Honestly though, personally..? I                   couldn't give two shits about                   race. I don't care if you're                   black, brown, green, purple...                   whatever. What I want is so much                   deeper: Your eye, man. I want                   those things you see through.                                             That's crazy.                                             Take it as a compliment.                                             You're not going to get away with                   this.                                                We have and we will. We'll be                     together soon, brother.                                   The television turns off. Chris clenches his body trying to          pry free from his restraints, before his shoulders collapse          with exhaustion. He lifts his head to a rip in the leather arm          of the chair revealing its cotton stuffing. He looks at the          cotton. We see Chris make a difficult decision.                                                             We hear nothing except a HEART BEAT.                                   Chris' head hangs, asleep. His lips are dry. Chris wakes up.                                   The Television turns on. On the screen, a woman's hand holds a          tea cup. With a spoon, she clinks it. We don't hear it though.          We still hear nothing but the HEART BEAT.                                               No, No--                                   Before Chris can finish SCREAMING, his eyes widen. He goes          limp -- unconscious again.                                   Rose enters wearing a white and black nurse's outfit with a          red cross on the chest. She rolls a medical table into the          room. She draws a dotted line across his forehead and around          to the back of his scalp. Then she unstraps his arm and          prepares it for an IV. She inserts the needle.                                   She goes to put earbuds connected to an ipod in his ears but          sees the arm of his chair has been stripped open. She looks at          Chris. Cotton makeshift earplugs have been stuffed in his          ears!                                   He's not really hypnotized!                                   Rose tries to scream but Chris grabs her throat with his free          hand and squeezes. The HEARTBEAT quickens. Rose pleads, but we          don't hear her.                                               Wait. Wait. Chris!.... Chri-                                   Chris chokes her. Tears stream down his face.                                               Shhhh.                                   Rose convulses. She scratches his hand and cheeks. He's too          strong. She stares at Chris' eyes as her consciousness fades.          Then, through the agony, her face curls into a twisted smile.          She's having fun. Psycho. Rose goes limp in Chris' hands.                                    Chris takes the cotton out of his ears. We can hear again.          ""You've got a Friend"" plays on the earbuds of the ipod.                                                                                      Earbuds also rest in Jim Hudson's ears playing the same song.          He lies unconscious on one of two operating beds in the center          of the room connected to an IV and heart monitors.                                   A bright medical light shines on Jim's shaved head which also          has a dotted line around it. The other bed is empty and has a          light shining on it as well. This bed is for Chris.                                   Dean stands in a black and white robe with a red cross in the          middle, his palms upwards in silent prayer near some          ceremonial candles. Jeremy watches his father. They are          unaware of what's happening in the Medical room down the hall.          Dean finishes his prayer.                                             Saw...                                   Jeremy hands Dean a circular surgical saw.                                             The vessel.                                   Jeremy leaves as Dean begins to saw into Jim's cranium.                                                                                      Chris finds an old badminton set.                                   Jeremy exits the room briskly and walks down a dark hallway.          He turns into the games room and finds Rose's body.                                   Jeremy's eyes go wild. He turns as Chris emerges lunging from          the darkness with a badminton racket. Before Jeremy can          scream, Chris slams him in the face with the metal side of the          racket. He pulls Jeremy inside and shuts the door cutting off          the sound from outside. Jeremy wilts in pain.                                   Chris whips him over and over warping the racket to a crumpled          bloody mess.                                                                                      Dean finishes sawing the top of Jim's skull off. He removes          the cranium preciously exposing Jim's brain.                                               Jeremy...?                                   Dean walks to the doorway. Dean scans the dark hallway. It's          quiet.                                              Ro Ro...?                                   Chris emerges charging from the darkness with Deer's head in          his arms. He punctures Dean through his neck and shoulder with          the antlers. Dean and stumbles back into the operating room,          deer's head attached.                                                             His call to Missy devolves into gargles. Dean falls knocking          the unused bed over along with some candles. The bed has          caught fire. The fire grows fast.                                                                                      Missy takes a whistling tea pot off the stove and pours          herself a cup. Georgina sits nearby knitting. The window, like          before reflects the room around them.                                   She sniffs the air. She is suddenly afraid. She turns off the          light illuminating the back yard. Walter runs back and forth          in the distance. She turns the light back on again. Chris'          reflection is now behind hers. He looks savage; covered in          blood. Georgina screams and runs out the back door.                                   Chris heads to the door, but sees his phone on the dining room          table. He goes for it.                                                                                      Chris runs through the dining room and finds his cell phone on          the dining room table.                                   Chris picks up his phone and presses the power button. The          loading screen comes up.                                   Chris grunts with frustration as he hears a creak behind him.          It's Missy, now in the kitchen doorway behind him holding her          teacup and spoon. She begins clinking her tea cup...                                                             Chris knocks the cup out of her hand spraying hot water on her          chest and face. She screams.                                    The cat bounds off the dining room table at Chris' face. Chris          punches it out of the air. This has given Missy enough time to          grab a knife. She lunges at Chris screaming psychotically.          Chris can't pin her down. She slices his hands. Chris grabs          the tea pot and cracks her in the head with it. She falls. He          hits her one more time. Done.                                   The cat slinks out an open window.                                                                                      Chris runs towards the front door. Before he can open it, he          hears a footsteps running upstairs from the basement followed          bloodcurdling scream from back in the kitchen:                                             Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!                                   Jeremy bursts though the dining room and pounces on Chris'          back. The two roll around.                                   Chris throws his elbow back at Jeremy who blocks it and uses          it to put Chris in a choke hold from behind. Chris slams the          back of his head into Jeremy's face. He does it again, and          again, and again. Jeremy squeezes tighter.                                   Chris, about to pass out, reaches into Jeremy's pocket and          pulls out his keys. He scrapes them deep into Jeremy's eye.          Jeremy screams in pain and Chris wriggles out of his grasp          tripping him with an improvised Judo throw. Jeremy lunges at          Chris again but slips on his own blood banging the back of his          head on the coffee table. He's out.                                                                                      Chris begins to run but then sees the beige sports car we          recognize from the opening scene. He looks at Jeremy downed in          the doorway and then at the keys in his hand.                                   Moments later...                                                                                      Chris is in the driver's seat. The tubular metal helmet sits          next to him in the passengers seat. His phone finally turns          on. There is a very small amount of batteries. He turns the          ignition. The English to French tutorial comes on.                                             I seem to have misplaced my                   passport. Je crois avoi egare mon                   passeport.                                    Chris peels off, driving fast through the field into the          night. He dials 911.                                             911 emergency, I'm at the home of                   Dean and Missy Armitage--                                   Chris looks in the rearview mirror as the house gets smaller          behind him. All of a sudden, BAM! The car slams into and over          Georgina, who, in the night, seems to come out of nowhere. The          phone falls.                                             Ahhhh!                                             Can you direct me to the nearest                   hospital? Pouvez-vous me diriger                   vers I'hopital le plus proche?                                   He drives on a few more seconds on a flat tire but then stops          the car. Chris breathes heavy.                                             No... no... Don't do it... Just                   get the fuck gotta here... Just                   go! Just... Fuck!                                   Chris puts the car in reverse and drives backwards beside the          motionless bloody heap that is Georgina.                                             Where is the nearest train                   station? Ou est la gare la plus                   proche?                                   He looks back at the house which is now filling with smoke.                                   Chris quickly gets out of the car and lifts what's left of          Georgina's mangled unconscious body into the passenger's seat          of the car. He shuts the door and gets in the driver's seat.          He floors it.                                   After a moment of driving, Georgina's eyes open and she rises.          The wig slides off her head revealing an old surgical scar          around the top of her head. Chris hasn't noticed her yet. He          reaches for his phone.                                             Can you please call the police?                   Pouvez-vous s'il vous plait                   appelez la police?                                   Annoyed, Chris turns off the sound system just before Georgina          grabs his face and scratches it.                                              Ahhhhh!!                                             Ahhhhhhhh!!                                   Chris, veers the car into a tree. Georgina`s head hits the          windshield hard and bursts open. She's dead. So is the car.                                   A bullet hits the rear view mirror. Jeremy stands in front of          the smoking house with a hunting rifle. He's soaked in blood.                                             Grandma!!!!                                   Chris looks at Georgina's body. Georgina was Grandma.                                             Grampa!                                   Walter, the grounds keeper, rounds the house at top speed.          Walter is grandpa and he's so fast.                                             Get him!!!                                   Chris crawls out of the car as Walter/Grandpa sprints across          the front lawn strait at him. Walter's hat flies off revealing          the surgical scar around his head like the others.                                   Jeremy shoots again, and it grazes Chris' side. Chris runs          through the trees. Walter/grandpa closes the gap quickly.          Another shot hits a tree. As Chris reaches the road, Walter/          Grandpa pounces like a jaguar and rolls him over on his back.          He pushes his thumbs into Chris' eyes.                                             Damn you to Hell!!!                                   Jeremy arrives behind them crying.                                             Kill him, Grandpa.                                             The gun, Jeremy.                                   Jeremy tosses the rifle. Grandpa catches it and holds it up to          chris' head.                                             You ruined everything!!!                                   Chris, blinded, raises his phone to Walter/Grandpa's face. He          takes a picture, flashing strait into Walter/Grandpa's eyes.                                    Walter/Grandpa doesn't shoot. Instead he looks up. Jeremy is          confused as to why Walter/Grandpa has stopped.                                             What...? Grandpa--?                                   Walter/Grandpa spins and gathers his bearing. His eye is          cocked and blood trickles out of his nose. He let's out a          PAINED MOAN reminiscent of the deer's.                                             Ahhhhhhh!                                   Walter/Grandpa shoots Jeremy in the chest. He falls. Chris, on          his back, pushes himself away. Walter/Grandpa sees Chris'          scurry. He turns looking mad.                                             Wait.                                   Walter/Grandpa raises the gun under his own chin and shoots          himself through the head. He falls. Approaching sirens blare          in the distance.                                   Chris lays in shock. It's over. Just then a hand grabs Chris          face! Jeremy's still alive! Blood pours from his mouth.                                             Ahhhhhh!                                   They both go for the gun, grabbing it at the same time. They          roll around in the grass. Chris ends up on top. He bludgeons          Jeremy over and over with the butt of the gun into the ground.          Chris is lost in violence.                                   2 police cars pull up. He drops the gun.                                             Hands! Hands! Get away from the                   weapon/ Show me your hands!/                   Hands! Hands!! Get on your Knees!/                   Hands! Hands!/ Goddamn Hands!!!                                   Chris, covered in blood, raises his sliced hands.                                             Look in the basement!                                   He is violently swarmed by officers. The house burns.                                                              Rod sits down opposite Chris who wears a prison jumpsuit and          smokes a cigarette. Both of them look like shit. Rod is gaunt          with circles under his eyes. Chris' hair and beard have grown          in.                                   There's a long silence.                                             I really need to...                                             ...I don't remember...                                             ...impress on you the importance                   of remembering some of those                   names. The fire didn't leave                                    They've clearly had this conversation many times before.                                             I don't remember.                                             You gotta help me out, Chris.                   Secret societies doesn't get you                   very far on Google. I'm over here                   feeling like I'm playing connect                   the dots on a fucking football                   field. One name...                                             I don't remember.                                             Well, try again please.                                             Rod.                                             Let's start at the beginning; walk                   me through it again.                                             Rod.                                   Rod knows he's been defeated.                                               I'm good, man. I stopped it. You                    know? I stopped it.                                   Chris is at peace. He takes a long good drag of his cigarette          then gets up and leaves.

Lashing a windowpane. A PIANO PLAYS somewhere off          screen. Beethoven's Fur Elise.                                                                                      A little boy gazes out into the storm. Nervous, eager, sweet.          Meet GEORGE DENBROUGH (9).                                               You sure it's not too bad out                     there?                                   Will (13), his older brother,   sits up in bed propped against          a pile of pillows, surrounded   by tissues and sheets of          newspaper. HEADLINES and TOYS   tell us this is the late 80's --          October, 1987 to be exact. He   puts finishing touches on                                                                         Don't be such a wuss. I'd come if I                     weren't dying. Now get the                     paraffin.                                               In the cellar?                                               You want it to float or not,                     Georgie? Go on. Storm's not gonna                     last forever.                                               Okay, Willy.                                   George jumps up obediently and goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          George hurries downstairs. He catches a glimpse of their          mother, SHARON DENBROUGH (30s) in the parlor playing piano,          an earthy beauty transported to another world while she          plays.                                                                                      George's stomach sinks as he comes face to face with THE          CELLAR DOOR -- the only thing between George and the monster          in the basement of his imagination -- IT.                                                                                      A WALKIE-TALKIE SQUAWKS next to Will. The sarcastic walkie-          talkie filtered voice of RICHIE ""TRASHMOUTH"" TOZIER (12), his          neighbor, filters through the plastic speaker.                                              Willy-boy.                                   Will, annoyed, picks up the walkie-talkie.   While looking          through his rain blasted window.                                              Trashmouth.                                   They wave at each other. Richie, bug-eyed glasses, turns the          wave into a middle-finger.                                              Thought you were sick.                                              I am.                                              Is it mortal?                                                                                      Flinging it open, George ventures his arm into the DARK VOID.          He gropes around and finds the LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. George          snatches his arm back.                                                                        Oh, balls. The power.                                   The dark basement glares back at him, taunting.                                                                                                                                                     What was that?                                   Will coughs hard into a tissue. Half-impatient, half-joking:                                              Nothing. Georgie and I are making                    a paper boat. Got to go-                                              Wait-!                                   Will turns off the walkie-talkie.                                                                                      George rubs the gooseflesh on his arms.                                              I'm getting it. I'm going to get                    it. I'm going in. I'm...                                   He steels himself and plunges into the void.                                                                                      George scrambles down four steps to THE CELLAR SHELF and          sifts through junk as fast as he can: SHOE-POLISH, RAGS, a          dusty bag of colored BALLOONS, a broken FLASHLIGHT, two          mostly empty bottles of WINDEX, and an old can of TURTLE WAX.                                   George stops and gazes upon the CARTOON TURTLE with hypnotic          wonder. CUT TO POV of something lurking in recesses of the          basement, watching GEORGE framed in the light of the doorway.                                                             Sensing this, George snaps out of it, grabs the BOX OF          PARAFFIN near the back of the shelf, and hurries back up the          stairs, slamming the door in our/It's face.                                                                                      Will melts a chunk of paraffin with a match in a ceramic          bowl, then dips his finger into the hot liquid and smears the          wax along the sides of the boat.                                              Can I do some?                                              Okay. Just don't get any on my                    blankets or Mom'll freak.                                   George dips his finger and spreads it.                                              Too cool.                                   They finish up and Will gives the boat to George.                                              There you go. She's all yours.                                              She?                                              You're the Captain, ain't   ya?                    Captains call their boats   she. Now                    put on your rain stuff or   you'll                    wind up stuck in bed like   your                    stupid brother.                                   They both grin, the cozy room full of cheerful brotherly          love. George kisses Will on the cheek, startling him.                                              Thanks, Willy.                                   He goes. Will looks to the rain-lashed window, piano still          playing. He's suddenly filled with a sense of foreboding.                                              Be careful out there!                                                                                       A DEAD TRAFFIC LIGHT sways overhead, its dripping black          lenses gazing back at A BOY IN A YELLOW SLICKER AND RED                                    Georgie races down the street past dark houses after his          PAPER BOAT, which sluices along a gutter swollen with rushing          rainwater.                                   Rain taps on George's hood sounding to his ears like rain on          a shed roof, a comforting almost cozy sound. The buckles of          his galoshes make a merry jingle as he goes.                                   The boat whistles past a blockade of sawhorses marked DEPT OF          DERRY PUBLIC WORKS, where a gouge in the blacktop sends it          sweeping diagonally across toward a STORM DRAIN.                                   George races after, trying to grab the boat before it's          swallowed up with all the rainwater. He SLIPS AND SPILLS to          the blacktop, crying out in pain.                                   The PAPER BOAT surfs up to the drain, circles around twice,          and goes in. George look ready to cry.                                              Willy's gonna kill me.                                   He walks over to the drain and peers in, water falling into          darkness. A dank hollow sound comes from within. Suddenly                                   EYES PEER BACK AT HIM -- from THE GREASY WHITE FACE OF A          CLOWN. Not Bozo, or Ronald McDonald, but something more old          world, freakish, like that of a 19th-century acrobat -- bald,          lithe, almost child-like. Meet PENNYWISE aka BOB GRAY.                                   George recoils back, shocked by Pennywise's presence. A          VOICE, a perfectly pleasant and reasonable voice, rises up.                                              Hello, Georgie.                                   George looks around him.                                   An OLD WOMAN watches him from the kitchen window of a house          just behind the drain.                                   CUT TO: POV from the OLD WOMAN's house. She turns her          attention back to her cat, scraping out the wet innards of a          can of tuna into a plate on the window sill.                                              Lost something?                                                             George expression mellows from fear to child-like wonder,          like he's seeing a circus bear balanced on a ball .                                              How did you get down there?                                              Me? Why the storm of course. Just                    bleeeew me away. It blew the whole                    circus away. How'd you like to join                    the circus, Georgie?                                   The faint, off-key sound of CALLIOPE MUSIC can be heard.          George inches closer to the storm drain.                                              Is there cotton candy?                                              Cotton candy? Oh yes. Cotton candy                    and bearded women and elephant shit                    and all the balloons a little boy                    could want. You like balloons,                    don't you Georgie?                                              I sure do. Do they float?                                   George takes one last fatal step forward.                                              Float? Oh indeed they do, Georgie.                    Indeed they do. Everything down                    here floats. And when you're down                    here with us...                                   The clown's sing-songy voice curdles into something horrible,          primal even, as George's arm is seized by Pennywise's          unusually LONG arm and CLAW-like hand.                                                             George's SCREEEEEAAAAAM rings through the sewers as we...                                   CUT TO the OLD WOMAN's POV again. The cat devours its food,          the old woman pleased with his appetite does not notice...                                   RACK FOCUS... Georgie's rag doll body flung left and right as          Pennywise feeds on him and tries to pull him through the          metal grate into the sewer.                                                                                      Soaring, percussive MUSIC crescendos over a wide shot of          glacier-cut mountains. Then, SILENCE.                                                                                                                PAN OFF glacier-cut mountains to reveal the TOWN OF DERRY,          MAINE, settled on a crosscut of the Penobscot River and          Kenduskaeg stream. It's a sturdy, picturesque Northeastern          town like any other, its rough-hewn industrial past bleeding          through a gentrified, decaying present.                                   TILT STRAIGHT DOWN to HANLON ABATOIR                                   SEVERAL multi-acre, manure filled sheep pens stand empty.          One has 50 sheep ready for slaughter, a path leading from the          pen grows narrower as it feeds into an industrial complex          designed for slaughter.                                                                                      LEROY HANLON (50s) works to move the sheep into line while          his son MIKE HANLON (13) watches from behind him.                                              Open the gate.                                              I'm sick of this, dad.                                              People need to eat.   Now open the                    gate.                                   Mike opens the gate.                                              How would you feel if you were one                    of them?                                   Leroy, haunted by this thought answers gruffly-                                              Humans aren't raised to be food.                                                             As if he were lying, that humans sometimes ARE raised for          food.                                   The sheep flood into a thinner pathway leading to the          interior of the complex. Leroy watches them as does Mike.                                              Everyday, watching them stupidly                    walk into that killing pen. This                    isn't a normal kid's life. You                    won't even let me go to school.                                                                                      Leroy takes the cattle bolt, places it on the head of the          first sheep. WOOMPH. The sheep drops dead.                                              Now why would you want to be in                    public school with the rest of                    those people down below, in Derry?                                   He hands it to Mike, expectantly. Mike dispassionately takes          the mechanism and approaches a sheep.                                              Because I want to be in boring                    classes with other boring kids and                    draw pictures in text books and                    play baseball and go to dances and                    grind.                                   He places it on the head of the next sheep, but can't bring          himself to pull the trigger.                                   Leroy does it for him.   WOOMPH.   The sheep drops dead.                                              I know, son. I get it. But you                    aren't like those people. We may                    work with sheep, but those people                    are sheep. Trust me.                                   The last point Leroy believes in like gospel.                                                                                                                Doors fling open and ROWDY 6TH, 7TH, and 8TH GRADERS spill          out. Books are hurled in the trash, papers strewn all over          the recess yard -- summer is officially commenced.                                                             Swept up among this madness is...                                                             Handsome, gangly, red-headed, the memory of his brother still          fresh. He walks with his dorky friends, all talking over each          other: EDDIE KASPBRAK, his EPI-PEN JR. (an adrenaline          injector for kids with life-threatening allergies) holstered          in his medicine-filled fannypack; STAN URIS (12), a trim and          tidy Jewish kid who dresses like a mini-accountant; and          RICHIE TOZIER, the neighbor with the walkie-talkie, a comic          book and video game freak with bug-eye glasses.                                                 So how's it work?                                    What work?                        So long suckas!                                   Richie flips off the school.                                                 Richie!                                                 The ceremony. Your Bar Mitzvah.                                                 It makes you officially a man                       right?                                    Kind of. I read verses. From      Then a seventh dimensional          the Torah.                        door opens up and Stan here                                            has to slay his Ronin master                                            over a pit of death. He wins                                            his schlong grows like six                                            inches.                                                 Shit, I don't need a Bar Mitzvah                       for that.                                   Richie howls.                                                 Just your mom's Cosmo.                                                 Marie Claire.                                                                        Vogue man. It's all perfumed. I put                    on my 3-D glasses and it's like                    you're there.                                   Richie ""motor boats"" the air in front of him.                                   ANGLE on a GROUP OF fashionably dressed GIRLS NEARBY. The          bigger, heavier one of the group notices someone off screen.                                              There's the ho-bag, now.                                   PAN to see BEVERLY MARSH (13) a dazzling cloud of auburn hair          and lovely green-gray eyes. Her clothes aren't as nice as the          group of popular girls, but she holds her head high.                                              She's the one all the eighth grade                    boys talk about.                                    They say she gives the best     Probably the only way she can          bjs.                            afford those rags she wears.                                          Give me your rings, Gretta.                                   Beverly sees the girls as Girl #1 puts Gretta's rings on her          fingers. Sensing trouble, she turns around and ducks right          back into school.                                              Hey cock breath, come here!                                   PAN back to WILL and his dorky friends.   Eddie stops dead,                                               Jesus, she's still here?                                   The RABBI'S WIFE, sleepless and desperate, lurks on the edge          of school property, scanning the throngs of departing kids          with desperate eyes. Next to her, a FRONT LAWN MARQUEE reads:                                                                        What do you think she's thinking?                                              Maybe she expects her son to just                    walk out of the school with the                    rest of us.                                                                        Yeah right, Dorsey Coen's been                    living in home ec these last three                    weeks.                                              They're not going to find him.                                              Sure they will. In a ditch. All                    decomposed, covered in worms and                    maggots and smelling like your                                    Richie is CHECKED TO THE PAVEMENT by TRAVIS BOWERS (16), a          sadistic tower of muscle. His glasses fall off and a pile of          comics and video game magazines spill from his back pack.                                              Sorry chode. Didn't see you.                                   Travis kicks the glasses away. His thug sidekicks laugh:          SNATCH HUGGINS (15), PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER (17) and VICTOR          CRISS (15) -- one a lunkhead oaf, another a perpetually          giggly fire-starting sociopath, and the last one a scrap and          scab junk yard dog type.                                   Victor grabs Stan's yarmulka and tosses it into the window of          a departing bus.                                              Frisbee, fuck nut.                                   Snatch burps in Eddie's face. Eddie wilts under the smell.          Will scoops up the remains of Richie's glasses, smashed by          the bus.                                              You suck, Bowers!                                   Travis and his goons turn. They glare at Will menacingly.                                              You say something?                                   Everyone around them stops and watches, waiting for Will to          respond. Eddie gives Will a look to shut it. He does.                                              Thought so. You got a free ride                    this year because of your little                    brother. But ride's over,                    Denbrough.                                               This summer's gonna be a hurt                    train, for you and your faggot                    friends.                        (to Snatch and Victor)                    Let's roll. We got a lard ass to                    find.                                                                                      A door opens by the dumpsters and out peaks BEN HANSCOM (13),          the ""lard ass"" in question, making sure the coast is clear.          He wears an oversized sweatshirt and a pair of girly high-          waisted blue jeans.                                              Soooo, you gonna let me go by or is                    there a secret password or                    something?                                   He turns to see Beverly.                                              Sorry.                                   He steps aside. Beverly tip-toes past, lighting a cigarette          like a pro.                                              ""Sorry""'s not much of a password.                    Now ""kittyhawk,"" that's a good one.                                              Ballyhoo?                                              Riproar.                                              Barnburner.                                   Beverly smiles and offers Ben a smoke. He refuses. She shrugs          and blows a smoke ring in his face.                                              If you're worried about Bowers and                    his merry band of a-holes hassling                    you, don't. I saw them all leave                    out front.                                              Thanks.                                                                        You're the new kid right? I'm--                                              Beverly Marsh.                                   A little too quick. His ears turn red with embarrassment.                                              I just know `cuz we were in social                    studies. Together, in the same                    class. You know, like the                    constitution test, and stuff.                        (realizing he's vomiting                     I'm Ben.                                   Bev smiles, knowingly. It's clear he likes her. Ben notices a          FAINT YELLOW BRUISE on her forearm. Bev notices him noticing.                                                  (off Ben's look)                    I slipped in the shower. What's                    your excuse?                                              I fell on three boxes of donuts.                                   Beverly laughs.                                              Well, see ya around Ben from sosh                    class. ""Get laid in the shade.""                                              Uh, you too, Beverly. ""Stay cool.""                                   Ben watches her go, totally smitten.                                                                                                                Dust collects on the piano in the living room. A stale quiet          suffocates the house. The only sound the ticking of a clock          and the distant yelling of playing children.                                                                                       Will Denbrough laces his shoes. As he leaves his room, he          notices the door to George's room is open, his FATHER, ZACH          DENBROUGH (30s), lost in thought notices him.                                              Hey Champ. Going out to play?                                              Yeah, Dad.                                   Will looks like he wants to say more, but doesn't have the          words to articulate it.                                                                                      Jumping down the stairs and rounding the corner, he sees his          catatonic Mother, silhouetted by the midday light, sitting in          the darkness, staring blankly at the piano.                                              Hi, Ma.                                   Growing accustomed to his parent's lack of communication, he          sifts through a PILE OF UNOPENED MAIL on the dining table and          finds his report card. Opens it. All A's.                                              I got my report card.                                   He holds the paper limply in his hands. She doesn't          acknowledge him and instead gets up and slides the doors shut          to the piano room.                                                                                      Eddie, Richie, Will, and Stan scramble in the front door like          feral animals. An enormous 300-pound woman sits in the living          room doing a puzzle on her own stomach. SONIA KASPBRAK (40s).                                              Hi Mom.                                              Mrs. Kaspbrak.                                              Ma'am.                                                                                       They raid the kitchen, stuffing Capri Suns, Ding Dongs,          whatever snacks they can find into their backpacks. Mrs.          Kaspbrak calls from the room.                                              Eddie-bear, where are you boys off                    to?                                              Eddie-bear?                                   Will elbows him.                                              Just my backyard, Mrs. K. We got a                    new, uh, badminton set.                                              Okay. Just don't go rolling around                    too much on that grass, sweetie.                    Especially if it's just been cut.                    You know how your allergies get.                                              Yes, ma.                                              Isn't he cute, boys? So cute.                                   She wiggles her fat toes at him. He's mortified.                                              Cutest boy we know, Mrs. Kaspbrak.                                              The Miss America of cute boys.                    Seriously.                                              Bye ma.                                   Fast as they came the boys blow out the front door.                                                                                      Will, Rich, and Eddie speed past the library.                                                                                       All green globes, curving iron staircases, and shadowy charm.          A librarian, MRS. STARRET (50s) places a stack of books in          front of Ben.                                                Isn't it summer vacation? I would                      think you'd be ready to take a                      break from the books.                                                I like it in here. It's--                                   He glances at a newspaper behind her: ""BODY FOUND NEAR CANAL          NOT THAT OF COEN YOUTH, BORTON ANNOUNCES."" Safe.                                                Inspiring.                                   Mrs. Starret smiles sweetly at this large boy.                                                Well, even with all this terrible                      disappearing of kids business, a                      boy should be with his friends,                      outside, having fun.                                   She starts stamping his books.      CHUCHUNP.                                                I'll try, Mrs. Starret.                                                                          What are all these for anyway?                                                                          I'm reading about the history of                      this place. You know how many                      spooky things have--                                                Excuse me, miss?                                   A ONE-ARMED OLD MAN comes up behind them wearing a U.S.S.          Indianapolis cap.                                                Where's the children's section?                                                             CHUCHUMP.   Mrs. Starret slides Ben his stack of books.                                                                                      Beverly opens her fridge. There's nothing in it but a          plastic jug of margarine, some half-molded white bread, and          suspect milk. She sniffs the milk.                                                                                      Beverly sips the milk, leaving a wholesome white mustache on          her upper lip. She looks up to see...                                   Her Mother, MRS. MARSH (30s), a former prom queen long since          faded, watching her. Studying her.                                                Bev.                                                Yeah, Mommy?                                   Mrs. Marsh sounds like she might be on sedatives.                                                You had your monthly, yet?                                                What Mommy?                                                Bleeding, between your legs?                                   Disgusted, Beverly shrinks.                                                No.    Why?                                                Soon, soon I figure.       And then                      you'll be a woman.                                   She sits down next to Beverly, grasping with her clammy palms          Beverly's free hand.                                                When it happens, once every 27                      days, you'll bleed, and you'll                      bleed the most right before the                      end.                                                             Beverly, squeamishly tries to remove her hand from her          mother's, but the harder she pulls away the harder the Mother          holds onto her.                                              I want you to go to the pharmacy                    today. To be prepared. You'll                    need to buy these.                                   Mrs. Marsh holds up a BLOODY TAMPON from a string.                                                                                      The Rabbi and Stan read the TORAH. Stan is repeating and          learning pronunciation of the words for his Bar Mitzvah.                                   He starts to lose attention as he looks around the ornate          room and the beams of light fingering out from the windows.                                              Are you paying attention?                                              Yes, sir.                                              Pay attention, son. This is                    important. This is about you                    becoming a man.                                              I am. I'm taking this very                    seriously Rabbi.                                   The Rabbi removes his glasses and looks at Stan.   His          thoughts carry him away.                                              Not everyone gets this opportunity,                    Stanley.                                   Stanley nods.                                              My son, God bless him, might never                    get a bar mitzvah. Do you realize                    that?                                   The Rabbi squares up to Stanley, holding both of his          shoulders.                                                                        We may never see him again, he may                    be dead now. And death is forever,                    Stanley, you don't come back from                    death.                                   Stanley nods as the Rabbi starts to tear up. He pulls          Stanley in close to him, as if Stanley were his own long lost          son. Stanley, pressed against the Rabbi can hardly breath.                                              Rabbi, I need to go pee.                                   The Rabbi cries.                                              Rabbi, can I go pee please?                                   The Rabbi stops, distances himself from Stan again and looks          deep into his eyes.                                              Of course.                                   He lets him go.                                                                                      Stanley walks down the old, molding stone stairs to the          basement of the synogogue. It's a rounded staircase that          spirals into the deeper foundations of the building.                                   He can't find the bathroom, but he does see the Mikveh--a          cleansing room for the women of a synogogue during their          monthlies. It drips water and is lit by a spare light bulb.                                                                                      Stanley walks in, knowing no one is watching him and unzips          his pants to relieve himself in the pool of water.                                   Suddenly, he notices something bubbling from below.   A NAKED          WOMAN, her pale white skin glowing from the light.                                   He backs away and quickly zips up his pants.                                   The woman rises to the surface, exhaling a long held breath          of air. She dries the water from her eyes and looks at          Stanley, not at all bothered by her nakedness or Stanley's          witnessing of it.                                                                        You like looking at my body?                                                                        It's okay, I won't tell anyone.                                   She looks down towards her privates, still below the water.                                              Do you want to see the rest of me?                                   Her hands slowly move towards her pussy, touching herself.          Stanley starts to back away.                                              I should probably be getting back-                                              You're going to be a man soon,                    won't you? I'll show you mine if                    you show me yours.                                   She starts to get out of water.                                   ANGLE FROM BEHIND her as she steps out of the water, towards          him. The naked woman's back is full of sores and bleeding,          her butt shredded and rotten.                                   And as she rises from the water, we see that her legs have          been reduced to bones and gristle.                                              Come here Stanley, come float with                    me.                                   Stanley trips over himself back peddling. He turns around          and jets out of the room just as the naked woman lunges.                                                                                      Stanley runs up and into the arms of DORSEY COEN'S MOTHER,          breathless. He looks up at her and SCREAMS and runs out of          the building. The Mother looks at the Rabbi, perplexed. He          shrugs and cleans up from their study session.                                                                                      Ben sits at a table of six by himself, flipping through books          on DERRY'S HISTORY.                                                              MURDERS, MASSACRES, it gets more and more violent. Glancing          up, he sees...                                   The one-armed old man plunk a NICKEL into a jar and take a          STAMPED POST CARD from a tray by the door. A poster there                                                                                                                 Ben sits on the steps, POSTCARD in his lap. He clicks a pen          open and, brow furled in concentration, dashes off a HAIKU.                                                  (whispering it outloud)                    Your hair is winter fire,                     My heart burns there, too.                                                                                      Ben is about to the drop the postcard into a MAILBOX when has          second thoughts. He holds it just over the slot. We see that          it's addressed to: MISS BEVERLY MARSH, LOWER MAIN STREET,          DERRY MAINE, ZONE 2. Ben closes his eyes, steels his courage                                                                        Hello hot tits.                                   Travis, Snatch, Hockstettler, and Victor prowl toward him.          Ben bolts, ass swinging back and forth like a girl. Travis          and his gang take off after him...                                                                                      It's no contest. Ben rounds the corner and just makes THE          KISSING BRIDGE, a historic covered wooden bridge carved with          thousands of hearts crossing right where the canal turns into          the wild, untamed barrens, KENDUSKAEG STREAM rushing below.                                              Gotcha!                                   They snag Ben and fling him against the railing. Travis flips          up his sweatshirt, exposing his fat belly, and slaps it hard.          Ben screams like a rabbit, whipsawing back and forth.                                                                        Look at that gut!                                              Sounds like a pig. Don't he sound                    just like a pig?                                   Victor SQUEALS like a pig in Ben's face.                                              You better quit, I swear.                                   Travis pulls a BUCK KNIFE from his jeans. Ben's eyes go wide.                                              Or what? You'll go crying to mama?                    I'll give you something to cry                    about.                                   Ben looks around for help. A CAR comes slowly down the          street. Travis hides the knife, pressing its steel against          Ben's white belly.                                              Go ahead. Yell. You'll be picking                    your fucking intestines off your                    sneakers.                                   The OLD COUPLE behind the wheel CATCH EYES WITH BEN, see his          tears, and STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR. Ben sees A CLOWN riding          in the back seat, grinning -- PENNYWISE.                                              Okay, tits. It's exam time. First                    question: when I say `Let me copy'                    during finals what do you say?                                              Yes! I say yes! Okay! Copy all you                    want!                                              That's good. Now how can we make                    sure that sticks?                                                             In two quick motions Travis SLASHES A BRIGHT RED ""T"" in Ben's          belly.                                   Snatch and Victor laugh.    Hockstettler pulls out his lighter          and a can of hairspray.                                                                          Let me light his head on fire like                      Michael Jackson.                                   Hockstettler jettisons a fireball with his make-shift flame          thrower, just past Ben's head.                                                No! Hold him. I'm gonna carve my                      entire name on his cottage cheese                      filled ass.                                   Ben is too shocked to scream. He looks over his shoulder at          the stream behind him, then back at Travis's bloody blade.                                                Now say it with me. What comes                      after T?                                   Ben plants his heel in Travis's chest and launches himself          backward over the railing, out of the grip of Victor and          Snatch. Travis is knocked back on his ass onto the pavement.                                                                                      Ben tumbles down the culvert, fetching up hard against a          fallen tree. He picks himself up, eye to eye with                                                                          Oh, you're dead, tits.                                   Travis comes leaping over the railing with the knife, Victor          and Snatch right behind. Ben grabs the hub cap and HURLS IT                                   PELTING Travis IN THE FACE                                   Travis trips up, taking down Victor and Snatch with him. They          all splash down in the stream, where Travis LOSES THE KNIFE.                                   Ben darts off across the water into a thicket of woods.                                                             Travis gropes around for his lost knife, suddenly hysterical.                                                My knife, Goddamn it! I lost my                      daddy's knife!                                   Victor and Snatch help Travis search the stream, their hands          passing right by where the BLADE IS WEDGED UNDER A LOG.                                                                                       Another boy's hand fishes around under water and grasps upon          something. ON Will as he PULLS OUT A SNEAKER. Behind him...                                   RICHIE and STAN throw branches, rocks, whatever into the          middle of the stream trying to DAM IT UP.                                              C'mon Eds get your ass down here                    and help.                                   EDDIE paces the embankment with their shoes and socks and          backpacks. He looks anxious.                                              No way. There's sixty million                    diseases in that stream. It's gray                    water.                                              What's gray water?                                              Tell `em Will. Your dad works for                    the public works.                                   Will is studying the sneaker.                                              It's like where all the wash water                    and storm drain runoff goes.                                              Sewer water. Pee and poop. I'm                    telling you guys you're splashing                    around in Derry's toilet.                                   Richie and Eddie shrug and continue building their dam.                                              Smells alright to me.                                    Guys?                             Seriously. I don't know why                                            we're down here. There's                                            poison ivy and mosquitos and                                            God knows what else could get                                            us sick. Not to mention we're                                            all alone down here. What if                                            we run into that psycho who's                                            been picking off kids.                                                              Guys--                          I overheard my mom talking to                                          my aunt in Bangor. She says                                          it's a sex fiend. Some                                          drifter. But no one from                                          Derry. Couldn't be.                                              Guys! Shut up!                                   They all shut up and turn to Will.                                              Whatcha got there Willy boy?                                   Will comes sloshing up. He flips Richie the sneaker.                                              Look inside.                                   Richie does. ""DORSEY COEN"" is written in black marker.                                              Son of a--                                   Richie tosses it to Stan who drops it like a hot potato.                                              Stan, you idiot.                                              Sorry.                                              What's the big deal? It's just a                    sneaker.                                   Will has to fish it back out of the water.                                              It's Dorsey Coen's sneaker.                                              Shit. This isn't good, guys. This                    seriously isn't good. We should go.                                              How do you think Dorsey feels?                    Running around these woods with                    only one friggin' shoe.                                              If he's still running.                                                                        What if... he's still around here?                                   They all lock eyes. Will and Richie come to a decision. They          pick up sticks and start sloshing down stream where the shoe          was found. Stan stays frozen.                                              Dorsey!                                              Dorsey!                                              Guys-- Guys stop. We're gonna get                    in trouble.                                              For what?                                              I don't know. Disturbing evidence.                    Contaminating a scene. We should                    just mark where we found the shoe                    and leave an anonymous note to                    Chief Borton. My mom would have a                    major cow if she knew I was playing                    down here, I kid you not.                                              Shit, Eds you get within twenty                    feet of a peanut she has a whole                    herd. I don't want to think what                    she'll have if you come home with                    another kid's corpse.                                              That's not funny, Richie. That's so                    not funny. Will, please.                                              I'm with Richie. If I were Dorsey                    I'd want us to look for me.                                              Fine. You guys can do what you want                    but I'm going. I have no interest                    in seeing the muddy mangled body of                                    He turns to see BEN STUMBLE FROM THE WOODS all bloody. Eddie          screams and sloshes out into the stream he was so assiduously          avoiding.                                                             They all see Ben.                                              Holy friggin' Moses. What happened                    to you?                                   BEN COLLAPSES on the river bank. The boys rush to his side.                                                                                      Mike streaks past homes and businesses on his bike, riding          into THE CENTER OF DOWNTOWN. He carries a package of MEAT on          his bike.                                                                                      Mike makes his delivery and gets cash from MR. COSTELLO, the          grocer.                                                                                      Mike deposits the money and takes a free lollypop from the          teller.                                                                                      Mike steps outside, throws up the kick, and pushes his bike          out into the street. Will's crew WHOOSHES PAST on their          bikes, Will and Eddie, and Stan and bloody Ben riding double.                                              Heads up, homeschool!                                              Eat me, townie!                                                                                      Travis, Snatch, Victor, and Hockstettler are still looking          for the knife in the water under the bridge.                                              It probably got washed away,                    Travis.                                   Travis grabs Victor by his collar and growls in his face.                                                                        It ain't been washed away.     It's                    been stolen.                                              Stolen, by who?                                   Travis points up the embankment at Mike, biking home over the          bridge.                                              That nigger right there.                                                                                      Mike bikes home, sucking on the lollypop, when he notices          something coming up fast behind him.                                   TRAVIS and his boys in a beat up Trans Am.                                   He starts peddling faster. Sees the KITCHENER IRONWORKS sign          ahead and skids right down its path towards the ghostly          titanic ruin.                                                                                      Mike looks around for a place to hide, a bird spooking off          from the twisted carcass of the factory building. The          Penobscot River flows behind.                                   Travis and his boys skid to a stop in the field, machinery          blocks their pursuit by car so they jump out on foot.                                   Mike finds a SMOKESTACK laying in shattered sections in the          grass. He stares into its big black bore, picks up a loose          tile, and pitches it in. It lands with a faint echo in the          darkness.                                                                                      Travis, Snatch, Victor and Hockstettler search for Mike in          the SKELETAL REMAINS of the old ironworks structure itself,          an open wound of twisted iron beams.                                   Oblivious to any danger other than their own volatile          potential, we get a sense that around every corner, some          ominous figure is just ducking out of sight.                                   Mike clocks them from inside the smokestack, the dodges          around the perimeter of the ironworks structure.                                                             He nears the CELLAR HOLD, a yawning chasm on the edge of the          ruins. Sees a Derry Historical Society PLAQUE:                                                             PENNYWISE appears across the cellar hold OVER HIS SHOULDER.          When Mike looks up from reading Pennywise IS GONE.                                   Mike looks back across the weedy field to THE FENCE, his bike          still leaned against it. It seems a million miles off.                                                                                      Travis and the boys continue to explore the far side of the          factory, sensing Mike may have made a run for the river.                                                                                      Sensing an opportunity, Mike books it back to his bike.                                                                                      Hockstettler notices something off screen.    Walks towards it.                                   Following Hockstettler we see what he sees: a lone BALLOON,          as if just leaving the grasp of a child, floating up in the          air.                                              What the fuh...                                   He looks back at Travis and the others, who are sniffing out          the weeds near the river.                                                                                      Mike gets to his bike and starts pushing it up the hill. He          looks back towards the factory. Travis and his boys still          haven't come back to their car. Mike pedals home.                                                                                       Travis, angry they didn't find Mike huffs back across the          field, throwing a piece of scrap pipe he found against a          giant corrugated wall. The entire factory vibrates with the          gonging sound.                                              Let's go! That jungle monkey ain't                    here no more.                                   Travis walks obliviously past AN EASTER EGG, smeared with          bloody fingerprints, but Hockstettler sees it, picks it up.                                              I'm staying.                                   The three of them turn towards Hockstettler like he's insane.                                              Why?                                              I don't know.                     I want to see its insides.                                   He points towards the door leading to the dark innards of the          factory.                                              You guys want to come?                                              Why the- Hell no. You mental?                    This place gives me the creeps.                                                                                      Travis and the others load up and peel off in their car.                                   Hockstettler watches them leave, a cloud of dust in their          place, then turns towards the darkest parts of the factory,          as if pulled deeper into the core unconsciously.                                   ANGLE OVER CELLAR HOLD, Hockstettler peers in.   He grabs a          handhold and sways over its cavernous depth.                                   HOCKSTETTLER'S POV: Nothing but darkness.                                   Hockstettler takes out his lighter and hairspray, launching a          fire ball that illuminates the cavern below.                                                             Monoliths of rusted machinery, half-submerged in stagnant          puddles of black mud.                                   And for an instance, a CLOWN.   Pennywise. Then blackness          again.                                   Hockstettler saw IT, but doesn't believe it. He unleashes          another fire ball. For a second we see the faces of DEAD          CHILDREN amongst the monoliths.                                   Hockstettler isn't sure if he's seen right. He walks in, the          hair rising on the back of his neck.                                                                                      Hockstettler carefully maneuvers his way down into the hold.          His feet, blindly tapping for purchase.                                              I ain't afraid. Any you ghosts                    down here can't hurt me.                                   As if it were a mantra, to make himself feel less scared.                                              I seen ghosts. I did them in their                    butt holes.                                   And out of the darkness...                                              Did they float?                                   He freezes.   Did he hear that or was that in his head?                                              I, I-   Who's there?                                   Hockstettler lights a ball of hair spray, it illuminates the          walls near him, but nothing far away.                                              There's no one down here. There's                    no one that can hurt me.                                   He moves down deeper. Lights the hair spray again, and for          second, we think we glimpsed, deeper in the shadows,          Pennywise.                                              Patrick... Answer me.                                                             Now sure he's heard something, Patrick stops. His breathing          starts to rapidly increase. He wants to back up, but he's          frozen.                                   He lifts up his hair spray can, finger shaking on the plastic          nozzle, he lifts the lighter. CLINK. The flint lights up          the small flame. Sputtering in the flowing air in the          cellar. His breathing is arrhythmic, compressed.                                              Because down here, we all float.                                   He sprays. The flame spits out and out of the darkness,          PENNYWISE the clown leaps onto Hockstettler, tumbling him          into the cellar hold, he drops the lighter and hairspray,          which rolls down to the feet of a child. A DEAD CHILD.                                                                                      The pack of boys, Will, Richie, Ben, and Eddie come biking          down Center Street and swing into RICHARD'S ALLEY. They jump          off, bikes clattering to the pavement.                                              Okay Richie, you and...                                              Ben.                                              Ben stay here. We'll get some                    bandages and stuff.                                   Will and Eddie race in, leaving Ben and Richie in the alley          which is emblazoned with a COLORFUL MURAL about the FBI's          ambush of the infamous Bradley Gang, a celebrated slice of          Derry town history.                                              Thanks for helping me.                                              You're not the only one on Bower's                    shitlist.                                   Ben nods, grateful for the company. He notices in the mural,          in one of the windows, a CLOWN watches the ambush with glee.                                                                                      Eddie snatches cotton balls and antiseptic and bandages off          the shelf like an expert. He checks the prices.                                                                        Woah, that's a lot of money. Will?                                   Will pulls out one crumbled dollar.                                              All I got.     You got an account here                    don't you?                                              You crazy? My mom finds out I                    bought this stuff for myself I'll                    have to spend the whole weekend in                    the emergency room getting x-rayed.                                              Well we need to do something. That                    kid out there looks like someone                    killed him.                                   They glance at the mirror where MR. KEENE (70s) the grumpy,          eagle-eyed pharmacist watches them like a hawk.                                              You consider a diversion?                                   They all turn to Beverly, who stands there sly and smiling.                                              Huh?                                              Your friend there. He has that                    thingy he always carries around in                    his cute little fannypack right?                                              My EpiPen Jr.?                                              Yeah. For when he spazzes out.                                              I don't spaz. Those are allergic                    reactions. Life threatening                    allergic reactions.                                              Whatever. The point is he has a                    track record right? Of spazzing                    out.                                                                                                 Eds, shut up. She's on to                    something.                                                                                      Mr. Keene fills prescriptions. Eddie flops out of the aisle          clutching his throat. Will and Beverly run out after.                                              Oh no. Eddie! Eddie!                                              I knew I shouldn't `a given him                    that granola. Mr. Keene!                                              You guys know the drill, don't you?                                   Will fishes the EPI-PEN from the fanny pack.                                              I'm a pacifist.                                              My mom doesn't like me handling                    needles.                                   Annoyed, Keene comes out from behind the counter. He kneels          next to Eddie and takes the pen, plunging it into his thigh.          Will screens Beverly as she SHOPLIFTS THE SUPPLIES and SLIPS          OUT THE STORE. Eddie opens his eyes, breathing normal.                                              Thanks, Mr. Keene.   That one was a                    real shit kicker.                                                                                      Will and Eddie race out laughing. Bev is waiting on the curb          to meet them. She flips Will the stolen goods.                                              Not bad for a bunch of amateurs.                                   She flashes a pack of STOLEN CIGARETTES and struts off          towards her house. THEY LOVE THIS GIRL. Will closes Eddie's          mouth and they hustle round the corner into RICHARD'S ALLEY.                                              We got it!                                                             He flips Ben his medicine. Stan runs up from behind, still          looking blanched from his synogogue experience.                                              Shit Stan, what happened to you?                    You look like you've seen a ghost.                                              Nothing.                                   He sees Ben there, looking like a train wreck.                                              What happened to him?                                                                                      ANGLE ON A CLOSE-UP of the ""Coen shoe"" placed on a desk in          front of CHIEF BORTON and OFFICER BOWERS, Travis' hillbilly          father. Will is alone in the room with them while--                                                                                      Ben, all bandaged up, looks on with Eddie, Richie, and Stan          as Will speaks to the police officers.                                              Beverly was there?                                              Yeah.                                              And she stole this stuff for me?                                   Stanley wants Ben to shut up, but Ben is beyond excited.                                              Did she know it was for me?                                              I don't think she even knows you're                    alive man.                                    Yes she does.                   What's going on in there?                                              What do you think? He's handing `em                    the kid's shoe. It's riveting.                                   Ben checks his Timex, cracked but working.                                                                         Takes a lickin' and keeps on                     tickin', huh?                                               My mom gave it to me so I wouldn't                     be late for curfew.                                               I think he means you, Big Ben.                                   The boys shove him playfully.   Ben shoves back.                                               It's funny, `til the last week I                     didn't think anyone knew my name.                                               You're pretty friggin' hard to                     miss.                                               Guys, you think whoever kidnapped                     Dorsey might of, I dunno... got                     Georgie too?                                    If he creeps in storm drains,    Who's Georgie?          maybe.                                               Will's little brother. Or was.                     Before your time.                                               Will won't talk about it but the                     kid's arm got ripped clean off in a                     flash flood or something.                                   Richie turns towards Stan, who's been unnaturally quiet this          whole time.                                               Cat got your tongue?                                               What?                                    Why are you so quiet?            What's Chief Borton going to                                           do with a shoe?                                    I'm not.   I'm listening.        A storm drain. Crazy.                                                             Will steps out.                                              Well?                                              What did he say?                                              Nothing. Thanked me for being a                    good young citizen.                                              So let's get outta here. Police                    stations always make me feel guilty                    of something.                                                                                      The five losers bike home, Will and Eddie, Stan and Ben          riding double. Will skids up to a chain link fence by the          rail yards. Eddie jumping off to take his usual short cut.          They all splinter off their different ways.                                              Later days.                                              Barrens? Don't fag out.                                              Fag you later.                                                                                      Will lays out on the carpet in front of the TV, eating ice          cream from a carton. His parents sit on opposite ends of the          couch like bookends, father flips through a Popular          Mechanics. His mom stares at the TV, her mind elsewhere.          There seems to be no connection between any of them.                                              I found something today.                                   No response. Finally his Mom stirs.                                              You say something honey?                                              That missing Coen boy. I found a                    clue.                                                             His parents flash looks.                                              Stay out of it, Will. Let the                    police handle these things.                                   They go back to watching TV. Will tries for some sort of          connection.                                              What about Arcadia?                                   His dad stops mid flip, all the air going out of the room.                                              We haven't talked about our park                    trip at the end of the summer.                    Usually by now we're all looking at                    the brochure together. We have so                    much fun there every--                                   Will's dad throws the magazine down.                                              Enough.                                   He storms out to his workshop. Sharon is too upset to look          her son in the eye.                                              What did I say?                                              Nothing... Your father, it's just                    too much to deal with right now.                                              I'll mow lawns. Paint fences.                    Whatever.                                              It's not that.                                   She loses it for a moment, then composes herself.                                              Your brother just looked forward to                    this trip so much. That park was                    his favorite place in the world.                                   She takes Will's carton and retreats into the kitchen. Will          is left all alone, TV blaring, spoon hanging over nothing.                                                                        Mine too.                                                                                      A slummy apartment over Lower Main Street. A Red Sox game          blares on from somewhere down the hall. We track down the          hallway and PAN just as Beverly starts to unzip her pants and          close the door.                                                                                      Beverly finishes peeing. She reaches for toilet paper but          there isn't any. She rifles through the toiletries under the          old fashioned sink basin looking for anything she can use-                                              Help me.                                   Beverly looks around for the voice, startled.                                              Help me, Beverly.                                   It comes from THE SINK DRAIN, above her head.                                   She stands, her pants still around her ankles, leaning          forward over the basin, looking down into the dark void.                                              Is s-someone there?                                   Nothing. BEV'S EYE PEERS DOWN THROUGH THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT.                                              We all want to meet you, Beverly.                                   She gasps, backpedaling, pulling up her pants.                                              Who are you?                                   The single voice turns into a cacophony, bubbling up through          the ages.                                              I'm Matthew... I'm Dorsey... I'm                    Veronica... I'm Georgie... Come                    play with us down here... Come play                    with the clown... You'll float,                    Beverly. Oh how you'll float...                                                             Terrified, Beverly dashes out.                                                                                      Bev finds HER FATHER (40s) asleep in front of the TV, still          in his janitor's uniform from Derry Home Hospital. His          toolbelt is thrown up on the coffee table.                                   She tip-toes over and steals the TAPE MEASURER.                                                                                      Beverly stands over the sink basin, tape measurer in hand.          The voice is silent.                                   She unfurls the tape into the drain, its tip disappearing          into the void.                                   FOOT BY FOOT she snakes the tape into the drain, until it's          fully extended at 20 feet. She waits for a voice. Nothing.                                   Slowly, she begins to reel the tape back in, counting down          the length as it winds back in. 16 feet... 15 feet... 14          feet... AT 13 FEET VISCOUS BLOOD COATS THE TAPE.                                   BEVERLY GASPS and drops the measurer. It goes clattering into          the sink, the tape coiling up like a snake, blood flickering          everywhere as she stumbles back, tripping into the shower.                                                             Like a demonic ejaculation -- blood splatters the mirror, the          wallpaper, bouncing off walls and covering Beverly. She          SCREAMS and runs out the door...                                                                                      ...into her father, who comes charging up the hall. She          screams again, recoiling away.                                              What the devil's gotten into you,                    girl?                                              The bathroom! Daddy, in the                                    His arm shoots out and GRABS HER WRIST LIKE A VICE.                                                                        Someone peeking at you, Bevvie?                    Huh?                                              No... the sink... in the sink...                                   He stalks past, dragging her behind him. They step into...                                                                                      Mr. Marsh looks around, eyes wide, blood splattered          everywhere, but the blood doesn't register with him.                                   He shoves her against the wall. Hard.                                              You know I hate gettin' rough with                    you. I never do when you don't                    deserve it.                                   He points back to the gory sink.                                              What's my tape measurer doin' outta                    my toolbelt?                                   He steps over and grabs the BLOOD-COATED TAPE, clipping it          onto his belt, blood on his hands now too. He doesn't seem          to see any of it. Only Beverly can. She realizes this.                                              Answer me girl.                                   He raises his hand.                                              The sink... I was... I thought I                    saw a spider...                                   Uncertain whether he'll hit her anyway, she closes her eyes          and prepares for a smacking.                                              A spider?                                              Yes, sir. I'm sorry for waking you.                                   He lowers his hand, gentle now, proprietary.                                                                        I worry about you, Bevvie. I worry                    a lot.                                   Smoothing out her hair over her forehead. The blood on her          face like finger paint. This is when he scares her the most.                                              You know why I don't drink or smoke                    or chase after women like other                    fathers do?                                              Because you love momma?                                              Not just her, Bevvie. You. You're                    almost a woman now, too. And I got                    me all I need right here at home.                                   He rests his forehead against hers, breathes in her scent,          goes back down the hall to his game.                                                                                      ANGLE ON a wet, dark spot as it grows on a white plaster          ceiling, the first droplet of water forming. SLOW MOTION as          it breaks away and falls through space...                                                                                                                ...onto Will's head. He doesn't stir. But then it is          followed by SEVERAL OTHERS. Finally, he awakes. Looks up.                                   A leak in the ceiling.                                   Will flips back his covers.                                                                                      Will grabs a bucket from a utility closet and, walking back,          sees Georgie's room's door open...                                                                                      Will enters, the room frozen in time. GEORGIE'S TOY BOX is          open. Photographs and posters line the walls.                                                             STAR WARS bedsheets crisp and military tight on the bed.    A          Lego Turtle on the night stand. Will picks it up.                                   Will sits down, Turtle in hand, and indulges in the sadness          that has engulfed his home for months. The loss of his          brother hitting him full force, he closes his eyes to fight          back the tears, but cannot.                                   He cries for George. Photographs of George, illuminated by          passing cars, seem to watch him from the walls.                                   A SHADOW seems to stretch across Georgie's room from the          doorway.                                   Will looks up but no one is there.                                                                                      Will steps out of George's room and finds DARK FOOTPRINTS IN          THE CARPET. He leans down and touches one -- squishy and          wet. They track down the dark staircase.                                   Will, heart pounding, follows the wet footprints down the          stairs, careful not to step in any of them.                                              Hello?   Dad?                                                                                      At the bottom of the stairs Will finds the footprints lead                                               Ma?                                   Will sees a YELLOW FLASH of something ducking around the          corner. Startled, Will drops the Lego turtle, which smashes          into pieces and scatters across the wood floor...                                                             Will looks back up the stairs half-expecting his parents to          wake up. Nothing but an eerie silence. He gathers his courage          and follows the wet footprints into...                                                                                       Will steps in, face to face with THE CELLAR DOOR, the door          creaking closed, light snapped on behind it, footprints          disappearing down into the cellar.                                              Georgie?                                                             Will slowly approaches the door and reaches out for the          handle, but stops with second thoughts. He starts backing          away, too spooked to go down, when he hears...                                   A CHILD WEEPING BEYOND THE DOOR, then...                                                                                                                Will opens the door, rickety stairs leading down into          darkness, the weeper somewhere in the recesses, along with          the steady sound of a LEAK.                                   Steeling himself, Will descends. He gets to the last few          rungs and is thrown off for a moment seeing HIS REFLECTION in          the basement floor, as if it were A BLACK MIRROR. He realizes                                                             Will looks up toward the leak/weeping sound and sees, curled          in the same corner where we had that opening POV...                                                             Rain rolling off him like he's still in a storm flooding the          cellar. He looks up at Will.                                              Why'd you make me go, Willy?                                              Georgie?                                   Will moves to step into the water when he hesitates, holding          his foot over it. He looks to Georgie whose expression of          distress seems insincere.                                              Help me, Willy.                                                             Will grabs a rake from the wall and pokes its tip into the          water. It's a good six inches deep.                                              You'll float.                                   Water and muck pour from his mouth as he says these last          words, an endless cascade.                                   Will recoils. Georgie glides over the water towards Will, and          we realize there is a creature beyond it, the colors of a          clown's costume, PENNYWISE, propping up Georgie's body like a                                    Horrified, Will races up the stairs as...                                   PENNYWISE crosses the flooded basement and scuffles up the          steps after Will, arms and legs splayed out like a charging          crocodile, Georgie's limp corpse strapped to his back.                                   Will slams the door on Pennywise's/Georgie's gross face.                                                                                      Will slams the door of his room and hides in his bed.          Panting. The DOOR KNOB starts to rattle.                                   Drip. Will looks up. The leak from the ceiling getting          worse. The DOOR KNOB rattles even more. Shaking until it          seems like its going to fall off.                                   Silence. Will approaches the door. He grabs a baseball bat          and prepares to attack. Swinging open the door, ready to          swing... it's his FATHER.                                              Will.                                   Seeing the bat.                                              Easy! What's wrong? What's all                    the noise about?                                   Will exhales, safety.                                              There's a leak in my ceiling. Then                    I went to check the cellar and its                                    Zack looks at Will's ceiling.                                                                        Where's the leak, son?                                   Will points at it but nothing registers for Zach.                                                                                      Will and Zach stand over the stairwell. Zach turns the light          on and walks down, much to Will's horror, into a puddle of          water.                                              Dry as a bone, Will.   Sure it                    wasn't just a dream?                                   Will holds himself, too freaked out to speak.                                                                                      Will, Stan, Richie, Ben and Eddie stand at the edge of a          police cordon. Beyond, CHIEF BORTON and A LINE OF POLICE          OFFICERS, SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES and VOLUNTEERS sweep the woods          with blood hounds.                                              But we got a project we're working                    on out there.                                              Barren's will be off limits for                    now, kids. Go on into town and                    play there.                                   They all look on in disappointment.   Then pick up their bikes          and head back into town.                                   A dog picks up a scent near A MORLOCK HOLE -- a cement          cylinder that sticks about four feet out of the ground with a          vented iron manhole cover stamped: DERRY SEWER DEPARTMENT. A          drone comes from somewhere deep within.                                   Officer Butch Bowers arrives with news for Chief Borton.                                              We've got another one, Chief.                                              Another what?                                              Kid gone missing.                                                                        Dear Lord.     Who is it?                                              One of my son's friends. Patrick                    Hockstettler.                                   PAN OVER to reveal Travis, waiting meekly inside Officer          Bowers' squad car.                                              The family notified you directly?                                   Officer Bowers nods for Travis to approach.                                              Then I did a little investigating                    of my own.                     Tell him what you told me, boy.                                   Travis doesn't know where to start.                                              Tell him, damn it! Tell him who                    you last saw him with.                        (he turns to Chief Borton)                    The negro boy from outside of town.                    The ones who run the abatoir.                                                                                      BEN'S HAIKU is propped on a night stand.                                   Beverly stirs awake. Her sheets and pillows are smeared with          blood. Her face crusted with dried gore.                                   Groggy, and nearly sleep walking, she sits up and walks out          without taking stock.                                                                                      Bev opens the door, wiping her eyes she approximates the          sink, bends over to wash her face and eyes. With the first          crust of blood removed from her eyelids, she looks into the          mirror and let's out a choked, exhaling GASP of horror.                                   Surrounded by brown and crusty wallpaper, is Beverly's          realization that the blood was not a dream.                                   Beverly's Mom appears in the doorway.   Beverly turns to her,          speechless, in shock.                                                                        Darling, sometimes I look at myself                    in the morning and think the same                    thing.                                   Beverly tiptoes out of the horror scene. She shyly looks at          her mother as she dries her hair over a blood-drenched sink,          oblivious to it all.                                              Look at these roots.                                   Beverly is speechless.                                                                                      Puddles of BLOOD seem to lap like small waves towards us.          PAN UP to reveal Mike and Leroy sweeping the blood and water          out of the slaughtering pen.                                   Officer Bowers followed by SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS enter the          facility.                                              Leroy Hanlon?                                   Leroy turns and notices the officers for the first time.                                              We need to bring in your boy for                    questioning.                                              For what?                                              Police business.                                   Mike turns to his father, frightened, shaking his head.                                              We need a lawyer?                                   He looks at Mike, searching for any indication what this          could be about. Travis appears in the distance and Mike          instantly knows.                                              Dad, it's-                                   Officer Bowers roughly grabs Mike by the neck and starts to          lead him out.                                                                        Let's go, boy.                                              Hey!   No need for that.                                   He grabs Officer Bowers by the arm. Bowers quickly and          excessively puts Leroy in a wrist lock and throttles him          against the killing pen fence. Leroy moans in pain.                                              Search this place, now. It's the                    perfect place to hide a body if you                    ever needed to.                                   Officer Bowers looks around in disgust.   Travis smiles from          the safety of distance and local power.                                              This ain't right! You need a                    warrant, you can't just-                                   Leroy seizes his arm, then his chest, then crumples to the          ground, losing consciousness in the puddle of blood.                                              Dad!                                   Mike tries to rush for him but he is forcefully escorted to a          waiting police car. Other Officers look to Bowers for          direction. Officer Bowers turns Leroy over.                                              Call an ambulance.                                                                                      ALL of the boys have gathered in Ben's room. An aimless          summer morning with nothing to do. They play with his junk          and are generally turning his room over. Will examines a          pair of walkie-talkies not unlike his own.                                              Whoa, what's with the history                    project, Benny-boy?                                   Richie notices that Ben's walls are covered in xerox copies          and historical drawings, all relating to Derry's history.                                                                        Oh, uh, when I first moved here I                    didn't have anyone to play with or                    anything, so I just started hanging                    out in the Library.                                   All of the boys turn and look at Ben.   Seriously?                                    What are you, the ""Reading      He's a regular Jordy Laforge.          Rainbow""?                                   Stan takes a closer look.                                              Why is it all, like, people getting                    killed and missing kids and stuff?                                              I don't know. There's just a lot                    of that here. Been that way since                    the original settlers.                                   Will, who was more interested in a Viewmaster, turns and          looks at the walls now. Sees a copy of an old-timey document          with 300 signatures. INCORPORATION OF THE TOWNSHIP OF DERRY.                                              You have a copy of the Town                    Charter. Seriously?                                              Derry started as a logging camp                    before it was officially on any                    maps. 300 people signed the                    charter that made Derry Derry. A                    month later they all disappeared,                    without a trace.                                              The entire town?                                   Eddie is freaked out by this revelation.                                              The people, the livestock,                    everything that was alive.                                    Jesus.                          Holy fuck.                                              Aren't you supposed to be Jewish?                                                             Stan thumps Richie in the stomach while still paying          attention to Ben.                                                 People in neighboring settlements                       thought it was Indians or something                       but there was no sign of an attack.                       The only clue was a well house that                       was burnt down to charcoal.                                                 Shit, maybe we could get Derry on                       Unsolved Mysteries!                                   Ben points out on an old map that has a translucent modern          map drawn by hand laid over it, his tracing coordinates-                                                 It was here. Right on the corner                       of what's now Witcham and Jackson.                                                 Hey, isn't that where Will's                       brother, Georgie-                                   Richie slaps Eddie in the back of the head. His fierce eyes          castigating Eddie for not thinking before speaking, Eddie          confused, ""wha-?""                                                 Yeah, it's where Georgie died.                                    I'm sorry.    I didn't-              (to Eddie)                                            Good job numb nuts.                                                 Don't worry about it. Why do you                       have all this stuff anyway? I                       mean. What are you going to do                       with it?                                   Will can't take his eyes off all of the information.                                                 I don't know. It was just a way to                       kill time, I guess.                                                 It's summer, dorkus. If you're                       gonna kill time, do it right.                                                                                       Will, Richie, Eddie, Stan, and Ben, stripped to their tightie-          whities (except Ben who still has a T-shirt), stand in a line          staring at the edge of a rocky outcropping in a quarry turned          pond. The black water of the pond foreboding, endless.                                              Who's first.                                              Eddie?                                              Screw that.                                              I'll go.                                              Ben, with those cuts you have on                    your chest, I'm not sure if getting                    in this water-                                              Will you stop with the grey water                    shit. You make it seem like any                    water we get in is like swimming in                    an out-house.                                              What's grey water?                                              Don't get him started.                                              I'll go first.                                              Too late.                                   The boys turn around to see Bev in a one piece summer dress.          She pulls off the dress quickly, down to her underwear,          sprints off the edge and jumps into the water. BOOM.          Cannonball.                                   The boys, not wanting to be showed up by the girl take one          last look at each other and jump in. SPLASH! SPLASH! SPLASH!                                    All except for Eddie, who crawls down the rock outcropping          and stares at the screaming and laughing kids enviously.                                                                        What are you waiting for? Why                    don't you get in you pussy?                                   Eddie dips the toes of one of his feet in.   Flabbergasted,          Richie gives up on motivating Eddie.                                   Richie dives under the water and swims beneath the kicking          legs of all his friends, a shark's P.O.V. He doesn't see...                                   PENNYWISE floating in from the depths beneath him.                                   On the surface Ben yelps, something yanking his leg. Richie          surfaces.                                              Very funny, Richie.                                              I thought so.                                   Something yanks Richie's leg too. Hard. He and Ben wait for          whoever it was to surface from the inky water.                                   Ben sees Will, Bev, and Stan swimming back toward Eddie on          the edge of the quarry. They scream and laugh and swim their          asses back to land.                                                                                      The SIX of them now sunbathe on the rocks at the edge of the          pond. Their eyes are closed, soaking in the vitamin D,          except Ben, who can't take his off of Beverly's tanning body.                                   Will sits up and looks out at the water. It is so black it          seems other worldly. Not breaking his stare from the water,          he addresses the group.                                              Do you guys ever feel there's                    something wrong with Derry. Like                    it's, I don't know, haunted or                    something?                                              Haunted how?                                              I keep thinking about Ben's walls.                                   Ben, happy to have something else to focus on other than          Beverly, looks at Will.                                                                        You mean how all sorts of disasters                    and disappearances and stuff keeps                    on happening here?                                              Yeah.   It's strange.                                   Stan opens his eyes and joins in.                                              Like any town, right? That's been                    around long enough, bad stuff is                    bound to happen. I mean, have you                    read the Torah?                                   Richie, turns over to work on his back.                                              Boys, you're ruining my sunbathing                    vibes with all this chitter                    chatter.                                   Beverly, eyes still closed, places a cigarette in her mouth          and lights up. Ben notices her hands shake as she holds the          cigarette in her mouth. The smoke swirls and dissipates over          them.                                              Have you been seeing ""things"" Will?                                   Will whips his neck to Beverly. He can't tell if she is          making fun or if she is seriously asking him for a bridge.                                              I... If I tell you guys something                    you won't think I'm crazy.                                              We already know you're crazy, Will.                    No judgement here.                                              I saw Georgie last night.   Only.                    It wasn't him.                                              Like.   In your dreams?                                              No. In my house, he tried to get                    me to go into the basement with                    him.                                                                        That wasn't Georgie, that was your                    neighborhood sex offender making a                    house call.                                              Shut up Richie. It wasn't just                    him. I saw this other... I don't                    know.                                              What did you see Will?                                              The clown?                                   Will, Stan and Eddie look at Ben.                                              Yes. That's what it was, a scary                    looking clown. And it had these                    teeth...                                              I saw something, too. In the                    basement of the synogogue.                                              I take it back. I'm judging all of                    you and you are all friggin'                    wackos.                                   Beverly, still laying there, exhales a long trail of smoke.                                              I need to show you guys something.                                                                                      The FIVE boys and Beverly stand outside her slummy apartment          building. She looks frightened to go inside.                                              My Daddy will kill me if he finds                    out I had boys in our apartment.                                              Isn't he at work?                                              Sometimes he comes home for a nap.                                                                          We should leave lookouts. Ben,                      Stan, can you?                                   Ben is ready to protest. Then succumbs, crestfallen.                                                What does he look like?                                                My Daddy?    Mean. Like a drunk.                                   Will, Richie and Eddie go with Bev.                                                                                      Bev opens the door. It creeks open. The apartment seems to          be empty. Afternoon sunlight illuminating floating dust          motes. She scouts around and lets them in.                                   Will, Richie, and Eddie follow her to a closed door at the          end of the hallway -- THE BATHROOM DOOR                                                In there.                                                Can you give me an indicator of                      what I'm about to walk into?                                                You'll see.                                                I hope it's Ed McMahon and I've                      just won publishers clearing house                      10 million dollar sweepstakes. But                      if it is, you really didn't have to                      go through so much trouble, you                      could have just brought Ed to the                      quarry.                                   She has no intention of going in. Will pushes past Richie and          opens the door.                                                Oh God. Oh God.                                                             Still there, faded into maroon clouds on the mirror and          wallpaper. Richie reels back into the hallway with Beverly.                                                             She looks from Richie to Will.                                              You really see it?                                              It's like someone slaughtered a pig                    in here. Or a parent.                                   Richie is slack jawed.                                              What happened?                                   Bev is so relieved she almost cries.                                              The sink. It came out from the                    sink. My parents couldn't see it.                    I thought I was going crazy.                                   Will goes to Eddie, who still stands frozen in terror.                                              You okay, Eddie? Eddie Kaspbrack?                                   Eddie snaps to it, suddenly more composed, resolute even.                                              Ed. Go outside. Get Ben and send                    him in here.                                   Eddie just nods and walks out the door.                                              You see it, don't you, Richie?                                   Richie nods.                                              We can't leave it like this.    Let's                    clean it up.                                                                                      Will, Richie, Ben and Bev clean like grim elves, using a          bucket of hot water, ajax, and some cloth rags. Slowly the          blood washes out. Reaching for the same rag, Will and Bev's          hands touch, a spark between them.                                                                                       Stan and Eddie stand lookout on a curb below.                                              What's taking them so long?                                              There was a lot of blood.                                   Eddie shakes his head. Something disturbing catches his          attention.                                                                                      Will pours the last of pink bucket water down the bathtub          drain. The bathroom now as clean as it ever was. The bucket          is filled with blood stained rags.                                              All I'm saying is maybe there's                    some weirdo going around Derry                    dressed as a clown. You know, like                    the Joker in a ""Dark Knight"" comic.                    Some whack job who likes to dress                    up and kidnap kids.                                              Okay, so how did he put Georgie in                    my basement?                                              Or blood in my sink?                                              I don't know. Who knows how crazy                    people do things, right?                                   Pebbles hit the window. Richie goes over, sees Eddie and Stan          jumping up and down. The sound of footsteps come up the          hallway. They look at each other, who's the extra footsteps?                                                                                      Mr. Marsh fumbles with his keys outside the door.                                                                                      They race through the apartment to a window that opens to          fire escape into the alley. Bev throws it open and Will, Ben,          Bev, and Richie climb through.                                                                        You okay?                                              I am now.    Thanks to you guys.                                   The window slams shut behind them just as Mr. Marsh enters          the hallway.                                   He sees a bloody rag on the counter and picks it up, wiping          his sweaty face, smearing blood all over it.                                                                                      Chief Borton and Officer Bowers hand Mike's mom a copy of          Mike's signed statement. He nearly has to defend himself          from her anger.                                    Ma'am. Ma'am.                     His father is in the hospital             (BEAT)                         in critical condition and          Ma'am!                            you, you're supposed to be                                            protecting the children!                                              Ma'am. We were just doing our job,                    but he's free to go home with you,                    now.                                              He damn well better be.                                   Officer Bowers leans into Mike.                                              You got lucky, boy. Could have                    been you who disappeared. Be                    careful next time creeping around                    old places like that.                                              I told you who chased me there.                                   Mike nods to TRAVIS BOWERS, who is sitting, shamefully, in an          office next door to Chief Borton's office.                                              Oh, and he will be punished, don't                    you worry, I swear on my belt                    buckle he will.                                   Officer Bowers smiles, looks at Travis, whose face reveals he          knows he will get a whooping that night.                                                                        C'mon, Mikey. Your father needs                    us.                                   Mike turns and follows his Mom obediently out of Chief          Borton's office.                                                                                      On their way out, Mike and his Mom pass Will, Ben, Bev, Stan,          Eddie and Richie scrambling in the door to the station.                                              What happened, homeschool?                                   Mike says nothing, his eyes looking forward in anger. Will          and the others rush toward Chief Borton's office.                                                  (blocking the way)                    Whoa whoa. Where do you crumb                    snatchers think you're going?                                              We know what's been taking the                    kids. Chief!                                   Borton steps out.    His long day just got worse.                                              It's okay, Butch. Someone try to                    do something to you kids?                                    Not someone.    Something.        There's like this spirit.                                              A clown.                                              Or sometimes it's something else.                                              Only us kids can see it.                                   Borton narrows his eyes at Richie, the only one silent.                                              Okay, stop. Is this you Tozier?                    Did you put them up to this little                    practical joke.                                                                        No, we all saw it.                                              Such wild imaginations. Too bad we                    can't bottle their little brains.                    Dry them out and grind them into                    powder to salt our food. Maybe                    then we'd see, what was it again?                                   Borton's exhausted.   He's having none of it.                                              You youngsters realize there's a                    penalty in Derry for filing a false                    police report. I don't want to                    have to call your parents, now.                                              But we're not lying.                                              You have any evidence?                                   The kids all look at each other, stymied.                                              That's what I thought. I don't                    want to hear another word of this,                    not here, not a whisper of it                    anywhere. Now go home, all of you.                    Eat dinner with your families,                    sleep and have sweet dreams in your                    pj's. And tomorrow, you're going                    to go play like normal kids and                    forget all about this fantasy about                    murder and monsters. This is an                    adult matter. You got it?                                              But you adults aren't doing                    anything!                                              Watch your tone, boy.                                   The kids all stand there, Borton's big frame intimidating.                                              I don't see you leaving.                                                                                       The kids all step outside, morally deflated.                                              I guess we're on our own.                                                             TITLE CARD over the PENOBSCOT RIVER:                                                                                                JULY 4th, 1988                                    A smoky haze obscures the setting sun and rough hewed          mountains.                                                                                      CRRRRRACK! A mailbox explodes as a Trans-Am speeds off, the          boys inside it whooping and laughing their heads off.                                   The car swings up to another and Travis Bowers leans out of          the window, throwing in a SIZZLING M-80.                                   He shuts the lid, pulls back into the passenger seat, and          screams to the driver, Victor.                                              Go! Go! Go!                                   Victor hits it and they roar off. Snatch and MOOSE SADLER          (16) scrunched like sardines in the backseat. They all look          back to see...                                   CRRRRRACK! The mailbox explodes. The boys share a hip flask          bottle of Southern Comfort-                                              God I love the Fourth.                                              It's my turn. Pass one back.                                                             Travis fishes the bag full of M-80s and bottle rockets and          they blow another mailbox.                                                                                      Mike enters, sheepish. Leroy is in bed, full of tubes to          bleeping machines. He looks decimated. Mike's mom is on her          way out.                                                 You'll be okay?                                   Mike nods.    She squeezes Mike's shoulder as she goes.                                                 Mom tell you what's the what?                                                 Doctors say it's inside your bones.                       And spreading.                                                 Your Mom's going to need you to be                       strong, Mikey. Help keep the                       abatoir running.                                   Mike nods.                                                 I'll try.                                                 You do or you don't do. No try.                                   Leroy coughs.    His lungs are filling with fluid.                                                 It's my fault.                                                 Stop that, Mike. There's no one to                       blame here. It's nature taking its                       course.                                                 You're coming home though, right?                                   Leroy looks at his son, sadness etched in the lines of his          sullen face.                                                 Pull up that seat.                                                             Leroy indicates a chair next to the bed. Mike pulls it up          and sits next to his Dad, leaning in close.                                              There's something I never told                    nobody. Not even your mom.                    Something that I think you should                    know in case...                                              In case of what?                                   He coughs again. Mike can smell the creeping death coming          from his father's insides.                                              When I was about your age. Me and                    my buddies would go to this place                    along the canal...                                                                                      YOUNG LEROY (13) and YOUNG DICK (13) sneak up along the rail          of the canal outside a raucous, crowded little gin joint.          Only black folks stand in line to get in, music and reverie          blaring from within. The two boys look at all the pretty          girls and snazzy men with awe.                                                                                                 Dad, I'm responsible. You don't                    need to tell me some long tale                    about drinking and driving or safe                    sex. I'll take care of things-                                   Leroy squeezes Mike's arm, frustrated.   Harder than he          thought he could squeeze.                                              I'm. Not. Done.                                   Leroy groans through his teeth.                                              This isn't about you, Mike. It's                    not even about me. It's about                    Derry. This town is like poison.                                   He coughs again.                                                                        Dad?                                              Shut up    and listen to me. There                    was one    night, 1960. I remember                    because    it was August and Chubby                    Checker    just dropped ""the twist"".                                                                                      A hot hot night, the little shack filled up to the rafters          with people dancing, twisting, enjoying themselves. YOUNG          LEROY and YOUNG DICK push their way through the sweaty bodies          to a window. They find some floaters on the sill there and          drink them up. Out the window Leroy notices...                                                             Stalk from the woods and light torches.                                                                                      The men in white robes -- THE MAINE LEGION OF DECENCY --          barricade the door with a cart and light the timbers on fire.                                                                                      Smoke starts to take over the place. People panic, stampede          the doors. They don't budge. Women, men are crushed against          the hot door as people push against them to get out. Young          Leroy among them. He's grabbed by his friend Dick who pushes          him out the window.                                                                                      Dick and Leroy go stumbling and coughing away from the          blazing shack, their eyes burning with smoke, blinded. They          trip over the edge into the dark waters of the CANAL.                                                                                      He seems to float off into a reverie.                                              Worse thing I ever seen. And the                    smell, that awful smell -- all                    cooked flesh. Somehow we ended up                    in the water.                                               Floating in the blackness, I could                    still hear all them screams. It                    wasn't until I surfaced that I                    could see the truth of it all. Of                    Derry.                                              What truth?                                              I saw something, Mikey. Through                    the smoke and the burning.                    Something I can't even really                    explain, but it was there, Dickie                    saw it, too.                                              What did you see?                                   A NURSE walks in with a chemo bag.                                              Mr. Hanlon, you ready?                                   Mike and Leroy lock eyes. Leroy leans in, whispers so the          nurse can't hear.                                              I saw what was really responsible                    for that fire, Mikey. Not the                    Legion. See those white boys, they                    were there, but there was something                    else, orchestrating `em. Had `em                    all in a fit and frenzy, moved to                    his whims. This thing, I don't                    even know how to describe it...                                                                                      A balloon surfaces from the waters, bringing with it          PENNYWISE. It pulls him over to a survivor swimming in          darkness and Pennywise pounces, dragging the victim under          water.                                   Leroy and Dick see this and are horrified. They begin          swimming back to the edge when a balloon surfaces nearby,          again pulling Pennywise, his face smeared with blood, from          the water.                                   It drags the clown toward them. They climb out of the canal          just as Pennywise gets within striking distance. Instead he          pounces on a woman there, dragging her under kicking and          screaming.                                                             On the shore Leroy rests in Dick's arms, the Black Spot now          just a heap of smoldering char, the grounds littered with          burned up bodies.                                                                                      Mike looks at his father, terrified.                                              Mr. Hanlon?                                                  (he grabs Mike's shirt                     Be careful out there son.                    Especially by the canal. The water                    in Derry is no place for no one,                    especially a youngster like you.                                   The nurse hooks up the chemo bag to Leroy's IV. She turns          towards Mike.                                              You might want to wait outside.                                   Mike hesitantly leaves the room as she pricks the needle into          his dad's catheter, Leroy wincing.                                                                                      Mike steps out into the corridor. The hospital seems eerily          dark, empty and quiet.                                   A LIGHT STROBES down the long hall. It draws Mike to it, like          a moth to a flame. He turns the corner and sees...                                   A fire alarm pulled, white greasy fingerprints on the lever.          Emergency lights strobe along the walls. No sound of an          alarm. No doctors or nurses anywhere.                                   Suddenly, at the end of the long corridor, a SHEEP trots out          from a door, staccato in the strobing light. It stops, looks          at Mike, then trots into another door.                                   Mike starts after it, baffled. He approaches the door the          sheep walked into, a stream of WATER FLOODING OUT ONTO THE                                    He stops, the water rushing past his feet. He looks back          behind him, the normally lit hallway now far far away.                                                                                      He hears the sheep just inside the open door. He enters          through it without noticing the stencil on the glass of the          door: ""DERRY COUNTY CORONER.""                                                                                      Mike enters a windowless bunker like room with all the metal          corpse lockers, metal autopsy table and a sink in the corner,          the emergency lights still strobing.                                   The sheep is nowhere to be found.                                   Instead Mike finds, in the middle of the floor under the          autopsy table, a DRAIN GURGLING UP WATER, the source of the          flooding out into the corridor.                                                             The door slams behind him. Mike runs over to it, jiggles the          lock, but it won't open. Behind him, in between flashes of          the strobe, PENNYWISE APPEARS THEN DISAPPEARS...                                   Mike stops dead, sensing It's presence like he did at the old          Ironworks. He slowly looks back as...                                                             Mike opens his mouth to scream but nothing comes out.                                   He's pounding on the door.                                              Somebody! HELP! Let me out!                     Dad! Mom!                                   He looks over his shoulder while continuing to BANG. The          tray inside the open locker slowly slides out, like a tongue          from a mocking black mouth. On it, under a white sheet, is a                                    Mike dares look back just as the sheet catches and the corpse          is uncovered. It's none other than PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER,          whose legs and arms (up to the elbow) have been bit off,          smaller, CHILD SIZE bite marks cover his body.                                   Mike jumps to a corner where he grabs a saw to defend          himself.                                   Water spews up from the drain with more and more pressure, a          pool now covering the floor, the edge of which seeps toward          Mike.                                                             Mike climbs up on a chair, afraid of the water, now with a          full view of Patrick's mutilated body.                                                                        It's killing your daddy, Mikey.                    Eating him away.                                              Shut up.                                              A worm inside a rotten apple.                    We're all apples, Mikey. All of us.                    You know the thing about apples --                                              Stop it.                                   Patrick's expression turns into a horrific, fearful murmur.                                              -- they float.                                              No!                                   THE WALLS START TO SLIDE IN. As if the room were shrinking.          The walls shepherding him towards Patrick's talking corpse.                                   Mike reaches behind him, scraping at the walls, looking for          anything with purchase. His hands find the FIRE ALARM.          Pulls it.                                   This time the alarm SOUNDS and the strobe lights freeze, the          room now fully lit.                                   Mike looks back, calipers raised, and sees the locker doors          closed again, no water on the floor.                                   The door opens behind him. It's the CORONER, Chief Borton,          and PATRICK'S PARENTS there to identify the remains of their          boy.                                   Mike is nearly catatonic.   He holds onto the Chief, catching          his breath.                                              What are you doing here, son?                                   Speechless and terrified Mike races past them out of the          hospital.                                                                                       Mike walks home, distraught, mindless to the traffic. He is          nearly hit by a car as he storms away from the hospital.                                   A Trans Am turns a corner behind him.   Headlights on high-          beam. It stops.                                   Mike turns, sees, realizes who it is, runs.                                                                                      Travis climbs out of the passenger seat and over to the          driver seat.                                              Move.                                   Victor gets out and runs around the car.                                              Hey, ain't that the little shit                    your dad gave you a whoopin' over?                                   Furious, Travis slams on the gas pedal.    POV of CAR, giving          chase to Mike.                                              I'm gonna run him over.                                                                                      Mike runs for his life, jumping fences, turning corners, and          running through pedestrians.                                   Travis' Trans-Am can't always speed, due to the amount of          people on the street.                                   Just when he's about to get within biting distance, BOOM.                                   The first of a long series of FIRE-WORKS, explodes over the          Derry sky, illuminating the street in a series of FLASHES.                                                                                      Will, Richie, Stan, and Eddie have gathered on Ben's roof to          watch the fireworks.                                                             BOOM. The boys ""oooh"" and ""aaaah"" while stuffing their faces          with an unholy array of massed snacks meant to rot teeth and          discolor the fingers with multi-colored MSG filled flavor          powders.                                   Richie, with sticky fingers, picks up a walkie-talkie.                                              Benny-boy, don't forget the ranch                    dressing.                                   The walkie-talkie SQWUAKS back.                                              Hey Richie. Eat a bag of dicks.                                   BOOM. Again, the sky erupts in dazzling light and color AND          CONTINUES TO with fireworks THROUGHOUT AND UNTIL THE END OF                                    Beverly, then Ben, appear from one of the dormer windows          leading to Ben's bedroom, with sparklers, bunches of bottle          rockets, roman candles and small firecrackers.                                                  (mimicking Paul Hogan)                    You call that a firecracker?    This                    is a firecracker.                                   He opens his palms, revealing SEVERAL M-80s.     The boys          collectively `woah' with excitement.                                              Nice stick, Richie.     How about                    this.                                   She opens her backpack, revealing a MORTAR with SIX turrets.                                              Holy shit!                                              Think that could take ""IT"" down?                                    How? We don't even know what      That's a good name for it          it is that we're looking for.     actually.                                              What?                                                                                      They nod in agreement.                                              I think it depends.                                   Beverly looks up from a SPREAD OF FIREWORKS laid out on a red          white and blue Captain America towel.                                              On what?                                              What we're scared of. It was                    Georgie's corpse for me cuz, cuz                    that's what I care about. It was a                    naked woman for Stan because he's                    so afraid of-                                              Getting laiiiid.                                    Only because your Mom-          You really want me to start                                          talking about your Mom?                                          Don't get me started cause it                                          won't stop.                                              Back to point. It showered Beverly                    in blood cuz...                                              Cuz blood always freaks a girl out.                                              Wow, you really don't know shit                    about girls do you?                                   Will smiles.                                              ""IT"" showered me in blood because I                    just got my period... and...                                   Eddie recoils in disgust while Beverly's mind goes to dark          places, to her father, and what being a ""woman"" might mean to          him now. Ben and Will both notice this change in her          demeanor.                                              I didn't need to know that.                                                                        It. It's everything and anything.                    All our nightmares. All evil,                    wrapped into one.                                              Into one freaky looking clown you                    mean. That's the only form that                    seems to repeat.                                              Ironic right? Something that's                    suppose to make kids laugh,                    actually being super freaky.                                   He does it Rick James style. Everyone laughs.                                              It makes sense though. If it's                    killing kids. A clown is the                    perfect cover.                                              Adults just ignore them. But kids,                    like your brother, Georgie...                                              They want to get closer.   See their                    tricks.                                   Just then Will sees MIKE running for his life down the          street.                                              Shit. Isn't that-                                              Home school.                                   They look where he's running from and see Bowers Gang, in the          Trans-Am delayed by foot traffic.                                              They're going to cream him.                                              At least it won't be our problem                    for a night.                                              That's cowardly, Stan.                                                                         Beverly's right. We can't always                     hide from them. We need to do                     something.                                               How?                                               With these.                                   Will points to their arsenal of fireworks.                                                                                                                Mike runs past families and kids distracted by the fireworks          display happening overhead, Bowers gang almost on him in the          Trans Am.                                   Mike cuts between a lawn between two houses, hopping a fence.          Bowers hits the gas and fishtails it around the next block to          cut Mike off.                                   Will and his gang see this and take a short cut of their own.          Ben, boy-boobs jiggling, takes up the rear.                                                                                      Mike spills out between lawns on Neibolt street; a dead end.          There is a small pier that cuts into the canal with an old          abandoned ""lock house"" at the end.                                   The Trans-Am roars into view at the other end of the block.          Revs the engine.                                                                                      Travis is focused on Mike, who is frozen in the street.                                               Got the little fucker now.                                   Another boy runs out with him. Will.                                               Is that that pussy Denbrough?                                                                        This night just gets better and                    better.                                   Travis slams on the gas.                                                                                      Tires screeching.   Travis guns it straight for Mike and Will.                                              Don't move.                                              You nuts?                                              Trust us. We're here to help you                    take these jerks.                                              We?                                   Looking to the side, Will has his walkie-talkie.                                                  (into the walkie-talkie)                    Not yet... not yet. Now!                                   Between the Trans-Am and Mike and Will, Ben and Richie heave          their shoulders into a large steel DUMPSTER filled with          construction material. They push it down a driveway that          leads to the street. It creaks, starts to wobble, then move          down the incline. When it hits street level, though, the          gutter stops it from going out into line of the Trans Am.                                              Fuck.                                   Will sees this.                                              Oh shit. Abort! Abort!                                              Abort? What does that mean.                                              Run!                                   They're about to dodge the car when-                                                             BEVERLY jumps out firing off her 6-BARRELED MORTAR handheld,          aimed horizontally, at the car. THUMP. The recoil throws          her back while the rocketing projectile explodes in front of          the Trans-Am. Travis and the boys shield their faces          SCREAMING as the front windshield explodes.                                              Woah!                                   THUMP. This one knocks her to the ground as the second          mortar flies right towards the Trans Am. Travis yanks the          wheel to the LEFT as the firework EXPLODES on the side of the          car. He slams on the breaks as Victor, Snatch, and Moose are          flung forward. Victor smashes his face on the dash board.                                              Is that girl for real?                                              Real as it gets... Now, Stan and                    Eddie!                                   Eddie and Stan charge from behind a hedge. Lighting bottle-          rockets aimed at the car. Travis and his boys have to duck          for cover as ONE of the rockets ZINGS through the car.                                              Those little motherfuckers.   Get                    out, get out!                                   The OLDER BOYS climb out the windows, ducking and covering          their eyes from the ONSLAUGHT of bottle rockets and roman          candle projectiles.                                   Crouched behind the trunk, Travis lights up three M-80's WITH          CLOWN FACES on them and tosses them like grenades at Beverly,          Stan, and Eddie's positions.                                   The M-80's blow HUGE fist sized holes in the blacktop, bigger          than can possibly be legal, exploding gravel peppering the          kids, stunning them for a moment.                                              Holy hell. What kinda gear do they                    got?                                              I don't wanna stay and find out.                                   Ben and Richie race up from behind, letting loose another          barrage as they pass Bowers' gang and the Trans Am, giving          cover as the FIRE FIGHT, literally, becomes a retreating          manoeuver towards the pier at the end of Neibolt street.                                                             Travis' boys cover their eyes but they make aggressive          progress towards the kids with their terrifying M-80's.                                              I've been waiting all summer to run                    into you, Denbrough.                                              Leave us alone Bowers. I don't                    want anyone to get seriously hurt.                                              Hurt? When I'm done with you,                    you'll wish you were in that storm                    drain with your brother.                                                                                      They regroup at the mouth of the pier, water on both sides,          Bowers in front. He throws another M-80, which tears into a          wood plank. Splinters shoot everywhere.                                              Will, we need cover--                                              The house. It's our only chance!                                   Ben points to the Neibolt Street house on stilts over the          black water. An imploded, condemned structure that slopes          like a man's half eaten face. Eddie is instantly horrified.                                              I don't think that's a good idea.                                              When do you ever think anything is                    a good idea?                                              Okay. Ben, we'll hold him off while                    we can, you and Stan see if you can                    find a way in.                                   Covering them, Mike, Richie and Will continue to fire off          what fireworks they have left. Bowers' boys light off another          barrage of M-80's. Will, armed with a plank bats one back          like a baseball. BOOM! It explodes at Victors feet.                                   Ben quickly runs towards the house, followed by Stan and Bev.                                   Eddie, stuck in the middle, goes after them down the pier.                                                                                       Ben and Stan split up looking for a way in.   All windows and          doors are boarded up or locked.                                              Really guys, there has to be                    another option.                                              You want to swim?!                                              I'm serious. This house--                                              Shut up, Eddie.                                   And then, as if by magic (or by Pennywise), one of the 2x4s          that cover a window to the basement slips to the ground.                                                                                      Will finds the backpack empty as Mike shoots off the last          bottle rocket. Will picks up some rocks as ammo. Mike and          Richie instinctively follow suit. Will winds up and...                                              Charge!!!                                   NAILS MOOSE IN THE FOREHEAD, drawing blood.                                   Travis and the others stop dead, incredulous, as rocks pelt          them. It turns into a crazy rock fight. Will looks back.          He can't see any of his friends who are on the other side of          the house.                                              Guys hurry!!!                                                                                      Ben and Beverly look at the window into the blackened hole,          then at each other ominously.                                              Rock, paper, scissors?                                              I'll go.                                                             Not wanting to be one-upped by Stan, Ben pushes him out of          the way.                                              No.   I'll go.                                                                                      The fight is getting desperate. Both Will and Mike bleed          from rock hits. Will, Richie, and Mike see Bev waving them          to come. They run for their lives towards the house, Travis          and his goons on their heels.                                                                                      Will, Richie and Mike round the corner of the house.   Will          looks down the pier, no one, then THEY HEAR BEN.                                              Down here!                                              I'm gonna kill you, losers! I swear                    I'm gonna kill you all.                                   Will sees a broomstick wave in the opening, beckoning them to          come in.                                              Go! Go! Go!                                   Mike and Richie slip in, lowering themselves onto a floor          littered with crates and boxes. Will last in just as...                                   Travis and his buddies round the house. Moose walks right by          the window they slipped into but doesn't seem to see it.                                              Where are they?                                   Victor and Snatch look at Travis for direction. Unmoved,          Travis walks around the boarded up house looking for a way          in.                                                                                      The kids catch their breath and lick their wounds. The          basement is a derelict and creepy undercarriage to a canal          lock house.                                                             A huge coal ENGINE bulked in the shadows, and next to it an          old COAL BIN and stone channel that leads directly to the          canal and water.                                              If we die here I just want to say                    that fight was friggin' awesome.                                              Shhhhush.                                   Richie does a little pistol shoot with his hands to Ben and          mouths ""awesome."" Ben smiles.                                              We shouldn't be here.                                   Will watches Travis and his boys walk past the basement          window again. Ben looks to Beverly, sees some gravel in her          leg like buckshot.                                              You okay?                                              It's just a scrape.                                                                                      Travis is getting frustrated. He can't find where or how the          kids have gotten into the house. He looks straight at the          window the kids crawled through, the 2x4 is still somehow          attached from the outside.                                                                                      The kids can see Travis staring straight at them through the          window, the 2x4 is non-existent, as if Pennywise is          preventing the boys outside from seeing in or entering.                                              They can't see the window?                                              We shouldn't be here.                                              Don't count your chickens.                                                                        Something wrong with your friend                    here?                                              We shouldn't be here!                                    Eddie?                             He's afraid of dirt.                                   Will covers Eddie's mouth as he continues to yell, ""we          shouldn't be here."" They watch anxiously as Travis and the          boys feet inch uncomfortably closer to them.                                   Then Eddie suddenly stops.                                                                                      Frustrated, Travis and the boys leave.                                                                                      The kids have surrounded Eddie.                                              What is it Eddie?                                              There's something I didn't tell you                    guys.                                              What?                                              This house. I saw something here                    once. I thought it was just my                    mind playing tricks, but now I                    know...                                   They sense what he is about to say isn't going to be good.                                              I saw ""IT.""                                   Eddie nods.                                              Jesus.                                                                        Why do you keep using our teams,                    guy?                                              Wha?                                              What does he mean by ""IT?""                                   Will looks to the gang, they all nod.     He turns back to their          newest member.                                              Something's wrong with Derry.                    Haunting it. Hunting and killing                    kids. We've all seen it.                                   Mike looks at them all, judging their earnestness. Feels he          can trust them, an instant connection with people whose fear          clings to your own.                                              I know.   I've seen ""IT"" too.                                   Just then, the house seems to shiver. As if its foundation          had shifted. A CLANKING SOUND resonates from the pipes.          Water BEGINS TO SEEP in through the cracks in the basement.                                              What exactly did you see here,                    Eddie?                                   Ben goes to the window they came through, but instead of          seeing out, it's now covered by the 2x4.                                              Guys, uh--                                   He looks at their feet. They all do. Water coming in fast.          Ben bangs a coal stoker against the boarded window. Rock          solid. Will looks for a way out. The stairs.                                              Stairs.                                   Suddenly they HEAR FOOTSTEPS, above. They look up as dust          falls from one side of the roof, slowly making its way to          directly over them. To the stairs.                                                  (whispering in fright)                    It's here.                                                             Will grabs on to Beverly's hand. She holds onto his with          equal vigor. Richie holds onto Eddie.                                   Ben holds the stoker like a sword.     Mike grabs a shovel.          They lead the way up the stairs.                                   Unless otherwise noted, they ONLY WHISPER now.                                                 I'm not going up there.                                   The others ignore him, follow Ben and Mike up the stairs.                                   Richie looks around him at the scary basement, the furnace          hulking in the corner like a being with eyes. The water          surrounds his shoes. He runs up after his friends.                                                                                      A door opens in the middle of the kind of creepy hallway you          don't want to find yourself in, ever. Scummy yellow water          stained wallpaper peeling like dead skin from walls. Sconces          hanging from their sockets and detritus is built up on the          wooden floor boards. No footprints anywhere.                                   Ben sticks his head out. He looks left, nothing, he looks          right, nothing. Directly in front of him, through a dark          parlor, is the FRONT DOOR.                                   As Ben disappears into the stairs again, the door closes,          revealing PENNYWISE THE CLOWN, at the far end of the hallway.                                                                                      Ben still has his hand on the door knob.                                                 The front door is right there.                                   Will nods.    Let's go.                                                                                      Pennywise is gone.                                   The kids all file out, sticking close to the filthy walls.          They dart into the dark parlor for the door, followed last by          Richie...                                   The room seems to extend and last longer than anticipated.          Finally they get to the door. Ben tries it. Nailed shut.                                                                        Shit. Guys, look.                                   Everyone turns and sees HUNDREDS OF CROWS perched atop the          railing of the main staircase and in the rafters above.                                              There must be a window open.                                   Will reads his mind, an upstairs window might be their only          chance to freedom.                                              C'mon.                                   Will leads the way upstairs.                                                                                      The children, petrified, slide up the stairs as silently as          possible, trying not to disturb the watching crows. Or alert          whatever else is there. The stairs creak and snap loudly.                                   They get to a 2nd floor hallway, the wind from an open window          blowing trash around. Will looks around...                                                                                      He beckons them into a bedroom with AN OPEN WINDOW. They          step over a moldy bare mattress shoved against the wall.                                   Beverly is the first one out the window, then Stan, then          Richie, then Ben. Ben looks back and sees Eddie standing by          the doorway to the hallway.                                              Eddie, what are you doing?                                   Eddie turns towards them, realizes he must have lost          consciousness for a second, doesn't understand why he was          standing there. He walks towards the window when                                   THE FLOOR GIVES WAY and he tumbles down to the first floor.                                                                                      If the house weren't spooky enough, this room is the          spookiest. A bunch of furniture is gathered in the middle of          the room covered in sheets. A dusty old refrigerator stands          in the corner. Dust everywhere begins to clear from Eddie's          fall. He is knocked out. His arm is clearly broken.                                                                                       Will, Mike, and Ben rush back into the house.                                              Eddie!                                   Will runs around the gaping hole in the floor and tries to          run down the stairs when...                                                             Will covers his eyes as the birds prevent him from going          down. Mike and Ben shore themselves behind him.                                                                                      The other kids scream from the window.                                              What's happening?!                                              Whatever it is, we don't want to go                    back in there.                                              We have to do something.                                   She looks around.                                              Follow me!                                   Beverly leads Richie and Stan down to the edge of the roof.                                                                                      Will, Mike, and Ben are being pelted by the birds still.          They retreat back into the bedroom and shut the door.                                                                                      Eddie, coming back to consciousness, looks around the room.          He moans in pain.                                              Guys?                                   From the hole above, Will and Ben appear.                                                                        Eddie.                                   Realizing he is alone.                                              Get me out of here.                                              We tried, we can't get down stairs.                                              What do you mean you can't get down                    stairs?                                   Eddie looks around the creepy room at the sheets.   Something          horrible could be under any one of them.                                              Do you see anything you could use                    to climb out?                                              I- I think I broke my arm.                                   He holds it up and the lower part of his arm hangs          irregularly. Behind him the old refrigerator SHAKES,                                                                                       It's 15 feet sheer drop above the dilapidated pier.    Richie          is too scared to jump.                                              I don't know, Richie.                                              You gotta a better idea?                                   Glass breaks and CROWS STORM OUT OF A WINDOW behind them.          Startled, they all lose their footing and fall, crashing down          onto a pile of rope below.                                                                                      Eddie looks to the shaking fridge. Blood oozes out of it and          starts to cover the floor, inching towards him. Eddie backs          away, horrified.                                              No. No no no. Will?     Help me!                                                                                       Will sees the blood, looks to Ben and Mike.                                              What do we do?                                              We can't leave him alone down                    there.                                   Mike looks at the old moldy mattress.                                                                                      Eddie hops onto a rocking chair as the whole floor is coated          with BLOOD.                                              Hurry, guys!                                   The fridge door starts to YAWN OPEN. Eddie curls in a ball          and closes his eyes.                                              This isn't happening. This isn't                    happening.                                   Inside is Pennywise, all curled up. He unfurls himself like          a coiled snake, holding a balloon on a string. It drags him,          floating just above the bloody floor, across the room toward          Eddie.                                              Open your eyes Eddie-bear. I                    brought you some cracker-jack.                                              Go away!                                              Away? But I just got here? And                    we're gonna have soooooo much fun,                    you and me. Now open those                    peepers.                                              No.                                              Kee-mon Eddie Bear. Don'cha wanna                    see the show? You're the main                    event.                                                             Eddie does. Pennywise is over him now, his teeth like razors,          his clawed hands reaching out for Eddie's neck.                                              You all taste soooooooo much better                    when you're afraid.                                   Eddie screeeeeeeeeams!                                                                                      Mike lifts up the mattress and sees a decomposed corpse of          some child underneath it. He screams, falling backwards          towards Will and Ben.                                                                                                                Fall onto Pennywise, smacking into the floor, blood          splattering the walls, impact cushioned by Pennywise's body.          They instantly fall to the side.                                   Will, Mike and Ben look over to see what broke their fall- a          just as startled Pennywise, writhing in anger.                                              Ah, fuck!                                   Eddie scurries away from Pennywise, who bares his fangs at          Will.                                                             Just then the board from the window rips off to Richie, Stan          and Beverly.                                   She fires a bottle rocket at Pennywise's face, exploding          right into his eye. The clown reels back howling.                                   Richie and Ben jump in and grab Eddie.                                   Pennywise pulls the rocket out of his burned socket and          growls at the boys, morphing into an ORANGE GAS that shoots          back into the fridge.                                   Eddie, Ben and Richie climb to safety through the window,          while Will watches from the window frame Pennywise's escape.                                                                                       The kids BANG on Mrs. Kaspbrak's door. She opens it, sees his          broken arm and freaks.                                                                                      Mrs. Kaspbrak is placing Eddie in the front seat of their          family car. He is delirious with pain.                                              You! You all did this!                                   She slams the door shut, hurting Eddie on the inside.   The          kids are all too spooked to talk coherently.                                              You know how delicate he is!                                              We were attacked, Mrs. K. Travis                                               Stop it! Just stop it! If it                    weren't for you boys and that                    little tramp they'd have nothing                    against my Eddie-bear... Ohh, where                    are my keys?                                   She's nearly in tears searching her purse. She dumps it out          on the ground, prescription bottles, used kleenex's, food,          deflated balloons. Gets on her knees and picks through it.                                              Eddie's done with you kids, you                    hear?                                   She gets up when she finds the car key, speaking with such          vitriolic focus, she seems possessed.                                              Don't come around here again, you                    don't deserve him. You're reckless,                    churlish little boys.                     This is why your little brother                    died, William, because you are a                    LOSER, a reckless reckless reckless                    loser. God help me if I were one                    of your parents.                                                             She gets in the car and screeches away towards the hospital.          They ALL watch the car disappear down the street.                                              Well, that went well.                                              Guys, I hate to pile on bad news.                                   Ben noses up to the window, Mrs. Kaspbrack's TV set flashing          in the dark. They all nose up, see what Ben sees.                                              No.                                   ON THE LOCAL NEWS: Chief Borton and Officer Bowers pose in          front of camera with THE ONE-ARMED OLD MAN in the U.S.S.          Indianapolis hat in handcuffs. Caption under them reads:                                                                        That can't be true.   We just saw                                    Mike just shakes his head.                                              This is all crazy.    Who are you                    guys anyway?                                              The only losers in town-                                              Who know what's going on.                                              Welcome to the club, kid.                                   They half-heartedly pat Mike on the back.                                                                                                                                                                                            Tilt down to the OVERHEAD shot of what we expect to be ""Derry          1988"", but instead we see forests, logging trails, a          hardscrabble 19th century downtown, and a LOG CABIN SALOON          squatting on the edge of the swollen Kenduskeag canal. Smoke          billows from its chimney, day drawing down to a misty dark.                                                                                      Follow from behind, a MAN in a lumberjack's jacket walking          through the muddy, waterlogged street, a double-bited ax          slung over his shoulder.                                   A WOMAN pleads with the Sheriff on the side of the street.                                              He didn't run away, sir! He's just                    a child, missing now for more than                    three days!                                   She sees the MAN.                                              Have you seen my baby, Claude?                    He's been gone near...                                   Claude ignores the woman...                                                                                                                And walks into the saloon, ""SILVER DOLLAR"" carved deep and          poorly into the wood over the door.                                                                                      Dozens of loggers are bellied up at the bar, drinking beers,          spitting chew on the sawdust covered floor. The man with the          ax, CLAUDE HEROUX, elbows himself a place at the bar and          throws down a TWO DOLLAR BILL.                                                             The bartender brings Heroux a schooner of beer, one          hardboiled egg in a bowl, a shaker of salt and some change.          Heroux salts the egg and the beer, his piercing eyes stuck on                                                             He devours the egg, downs the beer, then lets out a belch.          The man next to him gives a friendly nod. Heroux doesn't          respond. He kicks back from the bar, dragging his ax behind.                                   Heroux walks past a piano being played, whispers something          into the players ear, then throws the change from his meal --          $1.85 -- onto the piano top. The piano player tips his hat          and changes tune to something more festive, manic almost.                                   Heroux continues into the back, walking like a man in a half          dream.                                   At the table, EL KATOOK deals out a hand to a group of          railroad bulls -- TINKER MCCUTCHEON, FLOYD CALDERWOOD,          ""STUGLEY"" GRENIER, and EDDIE KING, a bearded man whose          spectacles are almost as fat as his gut.                                              You sitting in Claude?                                   Floyd reaches out to grab his hand when...                                                             Heroux's ax falls, chopping of Floyd's hand at the wrist.          Floyd recoils back shrieking, blood spurting from the stump,          his severed hand remaining on the table.                                   At the bar somebody calls for more beer. The bartender takes          a casual look back just in time to see...                                   Heroux bury his ax in Tinker McCutchoen's head. The big man          tries to get up, blood pouring down his face, then sits back          down again. A second chop finishes him.                                   Floyd, writhing under the table, gropes for his hand on the          table above it. Heroux chops his other hand off, Floyd          screams even louder.                                   Laughter from the bar as patrons rub the bartender's bald          head for luck. The piano playing only gets more giddy and          festive, then we see who's playing it:                                   PENNYWISE, fingers dancing across the keys like a virtuoso.                                   Heroux turns to Ed Katook, who struggles to pull his clutch          pistol from its shoulder holster. He slings the ax sideways          just as Katook gets the pistol out, burying it in his back.                                                                                       A shot goes off. But at the bar, conversation between two          loggers turns to the weather. This winter will be a jeezer.                                   Fat Eddie King falls to the floor trying to crab away from          the table. Heroux, bloody ax dragging on the floor, comes          over to the fat man who pleads.                                              Please Claude, I just got married                    last month.                                   The ax comes down into Eddie's ample gut. Blood sprays all          the way up to the Dollar's beamed roof.                                   Men at the bar laugh and eat their boiled eggs, dully aware          of the gorefest behind them.                                   Heroux pulls the ax out of his gut like you would a softwood          tree, rocking it back and forth. It finally comes free and he          brings it down again.                                                             Eddie's severed head goes rolling over toward the bar, right          to the foot of a drunk, who without breaking his call for          another drink, kicks it away.                                   In back, Heroux turns to the last man cowering in the corner:          Stugley Grenier. He takes a swing and Stugley ducks it, ax          splintering the floor.                                   Stugley scrambles into the OUTHOUSE and closes the door          behind. Heroux, now totally slicked with blood, stalks over          and begins chopping his way in.                                   He finds the windowless room empty. A sound comes from deep          in the pooping hole. He looks down just in time to see...                                   Stugley's boots disappear through the pool of shit and piss.                                   Heroux steps out of the outhouse into the carnage of the back          room. Exhausted and bloody from tip to toe, he takes a seat          at the card table, props his ax next to him, and starts          drinking what's left of the slaughtered men's beers.                                   No one in the saloon seems to pay much mind to this. No one          except Pennywise at the piano, who takes great pleasure in          the scene and the ditty he's playing, a greasy white smile on          his giddy, evil face...                                                                                       The Loser's Club sits in front of Ben.                                              And that is the story of the Silver                    Dollar Saloon.                                   They look horrified.                                              The point of telling us was?                                   Ben looks at Will.                                    I think it's pretty obvious.      Derry's not just haunted,                                            it's cursed.                                              Just like my pa was trying to warn                    me the night I met you guys.                                              That clown, whatever ""IT"" is, has                    been around Derry doing nasty                    things for a long long time. The                    Black Spot fire. The Bradley Gang                    massacre. All the way back to the                    first settlers who disappeared.                                   Richie holds up a dog-eared copy of ""A History of Old Derry"".                                    I don't know, man.   That         Lumberjack.                                               Whatevs. It sounds like bunk to                    me. Didn't the guy who wrote this                    go insane or something?                                              Exactly. No one listened to him                    like no one listens to us. And                    unless we do something, ""IT's""                    never going to stop.                                              What do you mean, us, Will?    We're                    just kids.                                                                        We hurt it at Neibolt.   That's                    gotta mean something.                                              Everything dies.                                   Richie looks at Mike, rolls his eyes.                                              We can kill it.                                              Okay Schwarzenegger twins, simmer                    down. We can't even free Eddie from                    ""mom jail"" let alone take down some                    freaky shape-shifter with a mind-                    meld on all the adults of Derry.                    However, I do believe we could sell                    this story to ""Tales from the                    crypt.""                                    No, no. This is far too         I don't want to see ""it""          whacked for ""Tales.""            again. Ever.                                              I don't think that's a choice,                    Stan. ""IT"" knows we know. We hurt                    it. It's going to want to hurt us                    back.                                              It's only a matter of time one of                    us is found half eaten in the                    Barrens. Or worse.                                   This is too much for Stan. He grabs his backpack.                                              I need to study for my bar-mitzvah.                                   Stan goes. All the kids look to each other.                                              He's just scared.                                              We're all scared. That's what it                    feeds off of. I heard the clown                    tell Eddie as much. Our only                    defense is to stick together.                                                                        Yeah well, the only time I've been                    spooked is when I'm with you                    jokers. I'm thinking I might be                    safer at home. At least I know my                    parents won't try to kill me.                                   Richie goes too, leaving just the four.                                                                                      Will enters the back door and grabs Stan's invitation for his          Bar-Mitzvah off the fridge:                                                                                      He hears fighting in the hallway.                                              Put it back up there! Put it back                    now!                                              I just thought, someone else--                                                                                      His mother stands in the way of his father who holds the          chest of Georgie's toys.                                              I don't care about anyone else. I                    care about Georgie. I care about my                    little boy who's gone.                                              Hey.                                   They both startle and look at Will standing there.                                              Willy, we need a minute--                                              Why? To scream at each other more?                                                                        This is between your father and me.                                              And Georgie right? You, dad, and                    Georgie.                                              Willy, stop.                                              No. You stop. I hate   it. Tip toeing                    around you guys like   I don't exist.                    Like I'm the one who   died and the                    only one who's still   here is Ge--                                                             His mother hits him hard. She instantly regrets it. She runs          down the stairs sobbing. Zach reaches out a comforting hand.                                              You okay?                                              What do you care? At least she                    heard me.                                                                        I miss Georgie, too.                                              We know.                                              Do you? Because it seems like                    every adult in this town is blind                    to what's really happening, blind                    to what any of us kids are going                    through.                                   Will shoulders past his father and runs out the door.                                                                                      Will sits on the curb across from the storm drain that killed          Georgie. His eyes burn with anger. He stares into the dark          void, half expecting Pennywise's face to appear any moment.                                                                        C'mon, clown. Show your ugly face!                    I'll stick another firecracker in                    it for Georgie. Blow your whole                    stupid head off. Send you back to                    wherever a creeper like you comes                    from. Where are you!?                                   He listens for a response. Nothing. Just the bubbling sound          of water rushing through the sewer. Water. Something dawns          on Will.                                                                                      Will bikes up to the edge of the hulking old structure.   He          clocks the river flowing just beyond.                                   Hundreds of black ravens, the same birds from Neibolt, watch          him from perches all along the skeletal structure.                                                                                      Will sees Bev's mom leave for work, then bikes around back          where he clocks a tangle of pipes protruding from the back of          the building down into a MORLOCK HOLE marked Derry Sewer.                                   Mr. Marsh watches Bill from the window above.                                                                                      Will tramps down to the spot where he found the shoe. He          looks back down the stream, water trickling out of the sewer          pipe into the Barrens. The water.                                   Something watches him from inside the cylinder of the pipe.                                                                                      Will bikes up to the mouth of the pier, the house suspended          over the canal, its imploded facade seeming to gape back at          Will like Munch's ""The Scream."" Water again. In Will's          mind, it all comes together.                                                                                       Eddie and his mom sit on the couch and watch soaps. Eddie          plays with a loose thread of his cast, twisting it in his          fingers, not a friend's signature anywhere.                                                                        Eddie? Eddie you there?                                   His walkie crackles from a high shelf over the TV. Mrs.          Kaspbrack looks at her son, eyebrows raised.                                              I thought I took the batteries out                    of that thing?                                   Eddie shakes his head, as if to say he didn't know.     She          points for him to get it.                                              Eddie? I know where to find--                                   He grabs the walkie, holds it tenderly in his hands.                                              Turn it off.                                   He complies.   BANG BANG BANG.   They both look at the door.                                                                                      Mrs. Kaspbrak angrily swings open the door. A surprised DR.          HANDOR, Eddie's general practitioner, is on the porch there.                                              Oh! Dr. Handor. You gave me a                    fright.                                   She spots Will over his shoulder, straddling his bike in the          middle of the street.                                              C'mon in.                                   They step inside.   Will pockets his Walkie and goes.                                                                                      Dr. Handor checks Eddie's cast.                                                                        How you feeling, son? Any pain?                                              No.   Feels fine I guess.                                              Kept the cast pretty clean, I see.                    Didn't you want any of your friends                    to sign it?                                              I'm not allowed to see them.                                              Why not?                                              My Mom thinks they're the reason I                    got hurt. She says I'm sensitive                    and they don't take care of me like                    she does.                                   Dr. Handor wants to say something, but hesitates.                                              She means your allergies?   Is that                    it?                                              Yeah. Mom says I should always                    carry my Epi-pen with me, in case I                    ever have an episode.                                              Mother knows best. Is that it?                                   Eddie shrugs.                                   Dr. Handor smiles, considering his next thought. He leans in,          too close for comfort for Eddie. For a moment it's creepy.                                              Eddie, do you know what a placebo                    is?                                                                                      A bottle of Southern Comfort sits on a log. BLAM!                                   Bowers shoots at it with his dad's police issue .45. Victor          and Snatch look on, giggling.                                                             He finally tags it, the bottle shattering into a thousand          pieces. They all whoop and holler.                                              Can I try?                                   He reaches for the gun.    Bowers pushes him back.                                              Sure. Go put the next target out                    there.                                   Travis points to the cat that's lounging there in the grass.                                              You're foolin' right?                                              Do I look like I'm foolin' numb                    nuts?                                   Snatch grabs the kitty and runs out to the stump. He wipes          away the glass and sets the cat down. It starts to meow and          tries to get away.                                              It's not staying.                                   Bower lines up a shot, sight of the barrel on the cat.                                              Hold it there, butt cheese.                                              What the hell is this?                                   Officer Bowers steps from his police cruiser in the driveway.          His face as red as fire.                                              Nothing, pa. Just cleaning your                    gun like you asked.                                              Cleaning my gun, huh?                                   He stalks up and grabs the gun from Travis. Smells it.                                   WHAP! He smacks Travis hard in the face, knocking the big boy          to the grass.                                              Normally I use a rod and cleaner                    not bullets and whiskey.                                               You two punks put your sticky                    little fingers on my firearm here?                                   Victor and Snatch are too scared to talk.                                              N-N-No sir.                                   Butch turns the gun on Travis at his feet.                                              You're not worth the salt you lick                    boy. I don't know how I let you                    squirm your way out your momma's                    womb.                                              Pa, I'm---                                                             He shoots the ground around     Travis feet. Travis squeals like          a girl, utterly terrified.      BLAM! BLAM! A large wet stain          spreads around his crotch.      Butch Bowers raises the pistol,          as if he were about to whip     Travis, who falls to the ground.                                   Butch shakes his head.                                                  (to the boys)                    Look at him now boys. Nothing like                    a little fear to make a paper man                    crumble.                     Clean your drawers `fore you come                    inside.                                   He spits out his disgust, stalks inside.                                   Victor and Snatch tip-toe over to Travis, not knowing what to          say or do. Travis does everything he can not to cry.                                              You okay, Travis?                                   An odd wind stirs through the grass there, a yellow menacing          gathering of clouds overhead. Travis suddenly notices...                                   A BALLOON, bobbing over his mailbox, string connected to          something stuffed inside.                                   Travis pushes past his two cronies and goes over to the          mailbox. Inside he pulls out THE KNIFE. The one he lost at          the beginning. And attached to the string a note:                                                                                                                A murderous look screws onto Travis' face as he turns his          attention to his house. And his pa inside.                                   He snaps the string and starts toward the front door with the          knife. The balloon floats up into the darkening sky.                                                                                      A THUNDERCLAP outside. The coroner steps out the door. Will          and Mike slip in behind him, Will propping open the door with          his Walkie.                                              Patrick was in one of the lockers.                    All the water bubbled up from                    there.                                   The drain. Will goes to it. Gazes down into the blackness.                                              The sewers.                                              What?                                              ""IT."" Whenever it shows up,                    there's always water around. The                    storm drain where Georgie died.                    The leak in my room. Beverly's                    sink.                                              My dad saw it near water, too.      The                    canal.                                              I'll bet if you trace every                    terrible event in Derry you'll find                    the same thing. Water. With the                    Penobscot river on one side and                    Kenduskeag canal cutting through                    it's impossible to escape.                                              Unless you live way out in the                    sticks like I do. We have to tell                    the others.                                                             Will realizes something.                                              Shit, Stan's bar mitzvah.   I almost                    forgot.                                              I wasn't invited.                                   Will hands him his invite.                                              You are now. Let's go!                                   A pair of YELLOW EYES glow from the drain.                                                                                      Beverly, all gussied up in a pretty white dress, heads for          the door. A hand snatches out from behind and seizes her arm.                                              Where you think you going girl?                                              My friend's party. I told ma--                                              You're all prettied up. Who you all                    prettied up for?                                              No one.                                   He shoves her against the wall, eyes her little body up and          down. Caresses her hair.                                              Don't lie to me, Bevvie. You know                    how I worry about you. I worry a                    lot.                                              I know daddy.                                              People in town seen you. Got to                    sayin' things. Like how my little                    girl been sneakin' around all                    summer long with a pack of boys.                    Only girl to the pack.                                                                        They're my friends, daddy.                                   He squeezes her cheeks with one hand, holding her head in          place.                                              You sure about that, Bevvie?                                              I-- I swear. They're just friends.                                              Friends? I know what's in them                    boys minds when they look at you,                    Bevvie. I know all too well. They                    want to do bad things. Did you let                    them do bad things to you?                                   He looms over her. Something in his manner is detached. Like          he's there but isn't there.                                              I'm a good girl daddy. Good, just                    like you raised me.                                              Is that so? Then what's this?                                   He pulls out Ben's Haiku Poem.                                                                        You had it squirreled away in your                    underwear drawer. Why would you                    want to hide it with your underwear                    Bevvie? What else are you holdin'                    out from me.                                              It's nothing, daddy.   Just a poem.                                              Your hair is winter fire,                     My heart burns there, too                                   He grabs her by the hair and pulls her up to him.                                                                        Sounds lusty to me. Who wrote it.                    Which one of your boyfriends?                                              I told you I don't have one.                                              Don't lie to me!                                   He drags her down the hall by the hair.                                              Daddy stop. You're hurting me.                                              You're ma says you're a woman now.                    You bled. What other womanly                    things you been doing down in the                    deep dark woods with those boys,                    Bevvie.                                   He throws her into his bedroom.                                              Nothing. Please, daddy. You don't                    have to worry. I promise. Please!                                              Let's see then. Prove to me you                    been good.                                   She doesn't know what he means.                                              Take off your tights.                                              What?                                              I love you Bevvie. You're special.                    You're such a pretty girl. But                    there's plenty of boys happy to                    roon a pretty girl. Plenty of                    pretty girls willing to be roont. I                    need to know if you're intact.                                   He unbuckles his belt, but he doesn't look at her like he          wants to whip her, there's another hunger in his eyes.                                              Your tights, girl. Take `em off.                                                                        Daddy, please.                                   He slides off his belt and grabs her, smiling, a smile that          feels all too reminiscent of a clown.                                              You'll like it, Bevvie.   Be like                    you're floating.                                   Bev kicks him in the balls. Her father lets go, crumpling          down. She knees him in the face as hard as she can, his head          flying back into the side of the door.                                   Beverly tries to race out the door but he snatches her ankle          and she trips into the hallway. By the time she is up he is          lunging towards her.                                   She stumbles back into the bathroom and shuts the door,          trying to lock herself inside. He kicks the door open before          the lock catches.                                   Without thinking Bev grabs the toilet top and smashes it in          her dad's face. He slumps down, unconscious.                                   She rushes out, then uses a chair propped against the knob to          shut him in the bathroom. Terrified she races out the front          door.                                                                                      Eddie stands in front of his mom, eyes blazing.                                              Placebo? Who told you that? Dr.                    Handor? He has no right. No right                    to say you're making up your                    sickness.                                              Not me, momma... You.                                              What?                                              He said I was never allergic until                    you made me start carrying around                    my Epi-pen. You put those allergies                    in my head.                                                                        That's a lie, Eddie! A bold faced                    lie. You're my treasure. The only                    thing I want in this world is to                    see you safe and healthy.                                              Then why did you send my friends                    away?                                   She starts to feel the fluttery bird of panic.                                              They were bad boys. You know that.                    And you... You were so sick when                    you were little. So very sick. It                    hurt me so much. I never want to                    see you go through that again. And                    I've kept you healthy, haven't I?                                              You lied to me mamma. You've been                    giving me medicine that's not                    really medicine.                                              Eddie-bear, please--                                              This is what's going to happen now.                                   He pulls out his Epi-pen and throws it in the trash.   Mrs.          Kaspbrak gasps.                                              I'm going out that door and you                    won't stop me. I'm going to my                    friend Stan's bar-mitzvah and when                    I come home you're never going to                    tell how weak or sick or delicate I                    am ever again.                                   THUNDER crackles outside.                                                                                      Will and Mike tear through the howling rain on their bikes.          They almost collide into Beverly who comes dashing around a          corner.                                              Bev. You okay?                                                                        No. No I'm not.                                   She looks back over her shoulder, terrified and wet and          shivering.                                              What happened. Bowers?                                              No.   My daddy. He... he...                                              What?   What did he do Beverly?                                   She looks at both of them, tears running down her face, her          pretty dress soaked in the rain.                                              I don't know. I don't know if it                    was him, or...                                              What?                                              I think ""IT"" was there, controlling                    him, I don't know, I can't go back,                    I can't go back, Will. I don't know                                    She starts to cry on Will's shoulder. Will looks at Mike.          They both look up at the convulsive yellow sky. SOMETHING          BIG is about to happen and they both know it.                                                                                      With torrential downpour outside, leaking water drips from          the ceiling onto the crowd below, who have cheerfully          employed umbrellas indoor to deal with the nuisance.                                   Stan is giving a nervous, but otherwise successful reading of          the Torah, despite the howling wind and end of days vibe.                                   Richie and Ben sit in the back in their little jackets.                                              This storm is crazy.   Like the                    sky's gonna fall.                                   SLAM! Everyone looks back towards the door, blown open by          the wind, and at Eddie, who sheepishly was trying to slip in.                                                             Stan smiles at his friend, pleased he's out of ""mom jail.""          The CANTOR gives him a nudge and continues reading.                                   Eddie slides in meekly next to Richie and Ben, checking his          clip-on bowtie.                                                  (through his teeth)                    Way to make an entry, Eddie-bear.                                              How'd you escape?                                              Guess I'm not as weak as I thought.                                                                                      The front door creaks open, Victor and Snatch poking their          heads in, both soaked to the bone.                                              Travis?                                              Mr. Bowers?                                   Nothing. They see a streak of blood on the floor that leads          to the KITCHEN and Butch Bowers on the linoleum floor in a          red pool, stabbed dozens of times, the knife left in his eye.                                              Holy shit.                                   Victor vomits.   The cat slips in and starts licking up the          blood.                                              Travis, dude, you okay?                                   Snatch continues on into the LIVING ROOM where he finds          TRAVIS sitting in Butch's favorite Lazy-boy in front of the          TV, which is turned on to PENNYWISE THE CLOWN SHOW.                                   He holds the .45, All slicked in blood, his eyes glazed.                                              It's my gun now.                                   He turns and looks at Snatch and Victor in the doorway.                                                                                       The STORM GROWLS outside. Richie, Ben and Eddie look at each          other, a little on edge. Suddenly the doors crash open again          and Stan stops, once again, looking up...                                   Will, Bev, and Mike slink into the back of the synagogue,          soaking wet. The Rabbi's wife shoots them a look of daggers.                                                                                      The reading is over and the crowd starts to gather to leave          for the reception. Will, Bev, Ben, Richie, Eddie, and Mike          are all huddled together. Stan is the only one not there.                                              What do you mean your dad attacked                    you?                                              It was like that lumberjack Ben                    told us about. The one from the                    Silver Dollar. He had this look.                    Like someone was pushing him to do                    it.                                              Not someone. ""IT"".                                   Eddie, thinking about his mother.                                              You guys, if ""IT"" can take over                    Beverly's parents, why not the rest                    of ours?                                              I can't go back there guys. He'll                    kill me. Or worse.                                   This sinks in to everyone. There's only one thing they can          do.                                              Will knows where to find ""IT.""                                              What do you mean?                                              The sewers. Me and Mike figured it                    out. That's how it gets around.                    That's where it lives.                                                                        Whoa whoa whoa. You don't really                                               If it means protecting Beverly,                    count me in.                                   Beverly looks at Ben, consistently impressed by his defense          of her.                                              Wait, count you in to what?                                              The sewers. We go in. All of us.                                              And friggin do what?   In this                    storm?                                   Water is actively dripping on them.                                              Get rid of ""IT"" before ""IT"" gets                    rid of us, one by one. It doesn't                    know what to do when all of us are                    together, you have to believe me.                                                                                      Stan shakes hands with his aunts and uncles near the front          door. The wind whips up the women's dresses and unhinges          umbrellas. Will and the gang run to him and whisk him out.                                              Hey guys.    How'd I do?                                              I hope your schlong grew those 12                    inches cuz you're gonna need it.                                              What do you mean?                                              C'mon!                                   The storm picks up force, wind blowing umbrellas inside out          and from the hands of guests trudging back to the parking          lot. One goes tumbling across the gardens and into...                                   THE BLACK BOILING RIVER and sinks into the dark water.                                                                                       Will and the gang arrive like their own hurricane in the dark          cellar workshop. Whipping around the room and picking up          objects, Will unfurls a map on his dad's work table.                                   The other kids stock up on whatever armor or weapons they can          find -- crossbow, hockey pads, a hubcap as shield, a          sledgehammer, a hockey stick shaved into a stake, satchel          full of car flares, hairspray. Stan is still processing          what's going on. Mixed with their formal wear for the event,          they look mildly ridiculous.                                              Hold on. How are we-?                                   Richie hands Stan a chainsaw.                                              Happy bar mitzvah, Jason. Bet you                    didn't put this sucker on your gift                    list.                                   Someone pounds at the door.                                              Will, what are you doing in there?                    Open up.                                   Everyone looks to Will.   He folds up the map into a backpack.                                              We need to protect each other Stan.                    The seven of us is all we have.                    Together ""IT"" can't hurt us. I                    promise.                                              How do you know?                                   More knocking.                                              Willy, now! We need to talk.                                   Will steps up to Stan.                                              I have faith. Just like you.                                   Stan looks to the others, everyone scared but ready for          battle. Stans steels himself, owning up his chainsaw. The          door shakes with Zach behind it.                                                                        Damn it, Will!                                   Will opens the back window and the kids slip out.                                                                                      The losers -- ALL 7 OF THEM -- stand on the threshold of the          Old Ironworks cellar hold, the very same one PATRICK          HOCKSTETTLER died in... a yawning chasm of mud, pools of          water and hulking, shattered old boilers.                                   The rain and wind howls, lightning cracking overhead. Will          points to a huge SEWER PIPE that juts out of the muck.                                              This is our only way into Derry's                    original sewer system before it was                    sealed off and modernized.                                                             A bullet sparks off a iron post next to Will's head.                                   Travis, Snatch and Victor stand at the crest of the road          leading to the factory. Travis has his dad's gun, aimed like          Dirty Harry at them. He pops off another round, BLANG-PING.                                              Oh, fuck!                                   Will grabs Bev's hand, who grabs Ben's who grab's Eddie's and          on down the line. They follow Will around the cellar hold to          a giant conveyor belt toppled against the edge. They scale          down it into the chasm, bullets pinging around them.                                   CLICK CLICK CLICK. Travis runs out of ammo.     He throws the          gun away and pulls out the bloody knife.                                              Man, this is where Patrick                    Hockstettler went missing.                                              No way I'm going down there.                                   Travis glares at Snatch, PENNYWISE appearing near the boy in          a flash of lightning.                                   Travis lunges with the knife and plunges it into Snatch's          tummy. Victor watches in horror.                                                                           Still have second thoughts?                                   Victor shakes his head no. Snatch stumbles back and plunges          into the darkness of the cellar hold...                                                                                      SMACK! Snatch's lifeless body slams into the muck right in          front of Will and the others.                                                 Oh my God oh my God!                                                 Don't look back!                                   They dart into the blackness of the huge, rusty pipe.                                   Travis turns back to Victor, a dull craze in his eyes.   He          gestures to the conveyor the kids climbed down.                                                 After you.                                                                                      The losers follow Will, who uses his dad's map to lead them          deeper and deeper into the sewers which roar and chime with          rushing water. They turn a corner and come to...                                                             The stream of water seems to disappear under the stone wall          there. Everyone is terrified.                                                 Now what?                                                 Uh, guys?                                   He shines his light on something in the corner...                                                 There's suppose to be a tunnel                       here. The last tunnel that's shown                       on the map.                                   It's a SHOE.    Eddie comes over it.                                                                        Dorsey's other shoe.                                   Stan sweeps his flashlight up the wall.   What he finds makes          Richie spring back.                                              Uh, guys!                                   Scrawled in blood on the stones is a warning:                                                                        Pennywise?                                              Shit, ""IT"" has a name.                                   Footsteps echo from behind them.                                              Keep moving!                                   Stan finds a loose stone.                                              Here.   Will, over here.                                   They all kick at the stones, which give way to...                                                                                      Travis and Victor race down the tunnels after them. They          turn the corner and come to the dead end, a pile of stones          kicked out from a BLACK HOLE. Travis kneels down and looks          into it. He can see Will and the gang's FLASHLIGHTS...                                              I seeeeeeeeeee yooooooouuuu losers!                                                                                      Will and the others slosh on their hands and knees down the          hole, with roots and bursting through its stone ribs.                                   It grows narrower and narrower to the point of complete and          utter claustrophobia. Mike looks back past Ben and sees...                                   Two shadowy figures crawling toward them.                                                                        Hurry!                                   Will, leading them, comes to a SMALL CORKSCREW in a tangle of          roots blocking them they all have to wrench their way around.                                   Ben, the last of the group, GETS STUCK.                                              No no no no no!   Guys!                                   Travis bears down, his knife clenched in his teeth.                                              I'm gonna carve you up, tits. I'm                    going to stick this blade right up                    your asshole and split you in two.                    Feed your ass fat to the friggin'                    pigs.                                   He starts squealing like a pig. Ben is freaked. Two pair of          hands grab Ben's arms and yank hard. He wrenches through the          corkscrew and stumbles out into...                                                                                      A thin membrane floats over gelatinous water, very delicate,          almost skin like. Underneath, thousands of spiders swim, nest          and writhe. He can actually feel their legs push against the          underside of the layer.                                              Oh my God oh my God oh my God.                                              Don't jiggle it too much, whatever                    you do.                                              We don't want it to tear.                                   Ben freezes, the spiders knowing he's there and gathering          under his butt. Bev, Stan, Eddie and Mike look on from solid          ground on the other side of the membrane.                                              Take off your shoes. You'll be                    fine. Just move real real slow.                                   Ben, Mike and Will take off their sneaks and crawl across the          membrane with great care. SPIDERS GATHER wherever they press          a knee or hand, the whole thing sloshing like a water bed.                                                                                       Travis and Victor get to the corkscrew pass. There's no way          Travis, huge compared to the other kids, will fit through.                                              No! No no no no! Fuck!                                              We'll never fit. We've gotta go                    back.                                   Travis grabs Victor by the scruff of the neck. A crooked,          bloodthirsty look flashes across his ugly face.                                              I need to hear them squeal.   Now                    you'll fit.                                   He puts the knife into Victor's hand and points to keep          going. For a split second Victor thinks about stabbing him,          but he's too scared. He squeezes his rangy frame through the          roots into...                                                                                      Victor flops out onto the membrane just as Ben, Will and Mike          join the others on firm ground.                                              Hurry.                                   Victor sees them.   He's freaked.                                              No. Guys. Wait! Please! Travis                    has gone insane. I'm not trying to                    hurt you, just...                                   Now noticing the room he is in, realizing the danger.                                              Take me with you!                                   Everyone looks to Will, who sees something on the membrane          that gives him pause.                                              Victor.                                   Will is pointing. Beverly follows his eyes to the knife in          Victor's hand, which has PUNCTURED THE MEMBRANE.                                                                                       Spiders spill out onto it's surface.                                              Oh god oh god!                                   He freaks, spiders jumping on him, his motion only ripping          the membrane more. It finally tears and Victor plunges          beneath the membrane, spiders devouring him, Victor screaming          in agony as they fill his mouth.                                   Horrified, Will and the others run for their lives.                                                                                      Travis hears the screaming, enjoying it.                                              Good. That's good, Vic.      Kill `em.                    Kill `em all!                                   Suddenly spiders start spilling out from behind the roots of          the corkscrew. Travis screams, and kicks them away. But          more come. Freaked, he retreats back to the sewer tunnels.                                                                                      Will, Ben, Bev, Mike, Eddie, Stan and Richie stumble from the          dark into a massive, soaring, subterranean Pantheon-like          hall, sewer water streaming past their feet...                                   In the center of the floor is a massive OCULUS, open to what          appears to be the edge of INFINITE SPACE. The water from the          sewers flows down into seven channels around this opening,          ending at...                                   SEVEN WATERFALLS THAT FALL UPWARDS into a reflecting pool          that covers much of the ceiling, surrounding a stone island          with a CRYPT TYPE STRUCTURE.                                   The whole cavern seems to be lit from within, a sickly,          pulsing ambient light coming from everywhere and nowhere.                                              Something tells me we're not in                    Derry anymore.                                              You think?                                                             Will heads toward the edge of the oculus, where the          waterfalls stream up.                                              Don't get too close to the edge,                    Will.                                              It's up there isn't it?   That's                    where ""IT"" sleeps.                                   Pointing at the reflecting pool.                                              You mean Pennywise.                                              It doesn't matter what it calls                    itself. What matters is it's                    afraid to show us what it really                    is. Which means we can beat it.                                   Will sees Beverly over by one of the waterfalls.                                              Guess I'm going first again?                                              Beverly, wait-!                                   She jumps into the waterfall and it sweeps her up up up to          the ceiling.                                   Will and the boys swap holy shit looks.   Ben jumps in after          her, then Will, Mike, and Stan.                                   Richie looks to Eddie, who has the same terrified look as at          the quarry. He holds out his hand.                                              You still afraid of a little grey                    water?                                              You still wear diapers at night?                                   Eddie grabs Richie's hand and they jump into the waterfall          together. They are swept up up up into...                                                                                       Plunging into the pool with the others. For a moment they          all flap and kick under water, unsure which way is up, then          Bev grabs them both and pulls them to the surface.                                   They're upside down now, the oculus opening to space below          them, gravity seeming to work by its own rules in here..                                              We all here?                                   Richie looks back where they just ""fell"" from.                                              Mind equals blown right now.                                   The camera flips around and THE WORLD RIGHTS ITSELF, the          oculus now above. The pool, which seemed small before, is          now enormous -- like a dark, brooding lake -- the crypt          island very far from them.                                              This is nothing like what it looked                    like from below.                                              It's in our head. All the stuff we                    see. It's like the allergies my                    mom said I had. We make it real.                                              We do.   Or IT?                                              Guys, the island.    Let's swim.                                   They splash toward the crypt island. Ben is the first to          feel something brush past his leg. A replay of the quarry.                                              Not funny, Richie.                                   He looks back and sees no one.   Richie is a couple of lengths          to his left.                                              What?                                   Ben suddenly realizes.   Bev also feels something on her foot.                                              The water. There's something in                    the water with us.                                                             Suddenly a WORMY TENTACLE extends from the water behind Mike.          Will sees it and whacks it away with his baseball bat.                                              Hurry!                                   The kids hustle it freestyle across the pool for the island.                                   WE PULL BACK WIDE TO SEE a monstrously big, faintly outlined          starfish-like creature with an orange glowing eye, lurking in          the depths of the reflecting pool.                                   Will, then Bev, then Richie dodge a tentacle and all get to          the island. Stan is not far behind, with Mike, Eddie and Ben          taking the rear, swatting back more tentacles.                                   From under Stan the ORANGE EYE APPEARS, the dark water around          him suddenly aglow. He looks down into it and it becomes          clear the eye is really a mouth, and the orange is coming          from deep inside its bowels -- THE DEADLIGHTS.                                   Stan looks directly into them and is mesmerized, so much so          that he stops swimming.                                              Stan what are you doing!                                   Paralyzed, Stan starts to sink toward the deadlights when          Mike, shielding his eyes, grabs Stan and swims him back to          the surface.                                   All the kids give cover with their weapons -- shooting          flares, swinging the sledgehammer, impaling with the stake,          using the hubcap as a shield -- so that Mike, helped by Ben          and Eddie, can drag Stan onto the island.                                    Stan? Stan, are you okay?       Stan!                                   He stares blankly ahead, as if his mind was wiped blank.                                              Stan, it's us. You in there buddy?                                   Another tentacle squirms out of the water toward them. Ben          shoots it with a crossbow. It goes slithering back in.                                              Guys. I don't think this is the                    best place to hang out right now.                                              Stanley, snap out of it.                                                             Stan blinks conscious.   He looks at them all.                                              Where am I?                                              The worst and only bar mitzvah                    party you will ever have.                                   They help Stan to his feet. Mike looks back over his shoulder          for the monster.                                              Guys, the water thing.    IT's gone.                                   Indeed, the reflecting pool is placid as ice.                                   Will looks back to the crypt, an obsidian stone heptagon-          shaped structure the size of one of Mike's killing pens.                                              Maybe. Or just changing into                    something else.                                              What do you mean?                                              It's using our fears against us.                    It wants us to be afraid.                                              Because we'll taste better.                                              And that's supposed to rally us,                    Will?                                              We have to stick together, to help                    each other against that kind of                    fear you only have when you're                    alone. Alright?                                   They all nod and follow Will onto the structure, starry deep          space through the oculus visible over their shoulders. They          come to a child-sized TRAP DOOR with an ancient, cosmic          marking. The only way in or out.                                                                        Ready?                                                             The kids steal themselves, weapons ready. Mike hammers a          clip into the stone and ties a rope to it. Nods all around.                                                             The door creaks open. Nothing but pure blackness inside.          Mike throws down the rope. Will looks at Bev.                                               My turn.                                   Will takes a breath, drops in...                                                                                      Will shimmies down about 5 feet of rope and lights a car          flare, illuminating the chamber in a blood red pall. The          walls inside are rough, like the surface of a meteor.                                   Directly under the trapdoor is a fountain like hole in the          floor open to the reflecting pool. Floating on the water is                                                             Pennywise emerges from the shadows behind Will, clinging to          the wall, joints all turned and wrong, like a spider.                                               Welcome to the circus, Willy.                                                             The trapdoor slams shut and slices the rope. Will falls to          the floor, flare falling into the water. It dims but doesn't          go out.                                   It's near PITCH BLACK. Just Will and Pennywise. He can hear          his friends banging on the door, calling for him but can't          see anything.                                   There's scuffling all around him. Close. Will dives into          the water for the flare. Rises. Sweeps it around.                                                                         I'm not afraid of you, clown.                                               Your brother wasn't afraid either.                                   A PAIR OF ORANGE EYES GLOW ABOVE HIM, IN THE DARK.   Will          can't see him.                                                                        Not until I chewed his little                    muscles up.                                   Will turns just in time for the eyes to recede into the          black. The pounding on the trap door has stopped.                                              Guys?                                                                        Ahhhh!                                   Will drops his bag of flares and scrambles off, tripping over          the hole in the floor, leg sloshing in the pool.                                   Glimpses of Pennywise scuffling in the dark like a spider.                                   Will finds a corner, the flare running out of spark. He          waves it this way and that, illuminating the dark in front of          him. Swinging his baseball bat wildly at shadows.                                              Come out from the dark then. Come                    out from behind that stupid mask                    and show me what you really are.                    C'mon!                                   Will looks at the last light of his flare, waiting for the          end. He looks the bat in his clutch only to see it's morphed          into...                                                             He throws it away into the darkness.   The flare goes out.                                                                        Ooooh I'd love to, Will. I'd just                    love to show you my deadlights.                    Only you wouldn't understand. And                    I need you to, Willy, I really                    really need you to understand                    what's going to happen to you.                    What it means for a little kiddie                    like you... to float.                                   A light seems to emanate from the pool underneath them,          illuminating the space, illuminating...                                                                                      Will sees all of ""IT"" now. From his bare crusty feet to his          bald head. His claw-like hands and his emaciated acrobat-          like body. He floats just a few inches over the stone floor.                                   Will's eyes fall to the baseball bat half-way between them.          He lunges for it, Pennywise knocking it away. The clown          seizes his neck, smiles hungrily, bares his twisted fangs.                                              I'm sorry, Georgie.                                   Pennywise goes for a bite and...                                                             An arrow shoots through it's face. The injured clown recoils          away. Bev flops out from the reflecting pool, followed by          Ben, Richie, Stan, Eddie, and Mike.                                              Break into our homes, we break into                    yours.                                   Pennywise pulls the arrow from his bloody mouth.                                              Charge!                                                             Mike with crow bar, Stan with chainsaw, Ben with a hub cap          shield and sledgehammer, Richie with his hockey stick stake,          Eddie with a nail gun. Will grabs his bat and joins them.                                   Pennywise tries to fend off this ""Lord of the Flies""          rebellion, becoming bigger, fiercer, more grotesque, but the          kids are too much. Just when they have ""IT"" bleeding and          backed into a corner for the death blow...                                              Wait!                                   Will grabs Ben's sledgehammer. The creature that looks up at          them isn't Pennywise but... GEORGIE                                              Please, Willy. Please don't hurt                    me.                                              You're not Georgie.                                                                        I am. I'm in here, Willy. We all                    are. This is the place we float.                                              Will, it's a trick.                                              It's not your fault Willy. Not                    you're fault I'm stuck here. But                    you're hurting us all.                                              It's trying to get to you, Will.                    Kill it. Kill it now.                                              No!   I have to think.                                              Mom and dad they should know. They                    should know it's not your fault.                    I'll tell `em. I'll tell `em as                    long as you don't hurt us anymore.                                   Will is confused. This is the one thing he wanted to hear.          Beverly hands him his satchel with the car flares.                                              Finish him, Will. For all of us.                    For Georgie.                                   Will looks to the scared little boy on the ground.                                              I'm taking this fucker out.                                              No.                                   Will grabs his stake away. He turns to Georgie.   Kneels          down. Takes his wet little head in his hands.                                              I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't go                    out there with you. I'm sorry I                    was sick.                                              It's okay, Willy. I know.                    Everything'll be okay.                                                                                                 Hairspray.                                   Bev sprays it through his lit flare.   Torching Georgie.                                              No!   No Willy! Please!                                   GEORGIE REVERTS BACK TO PENNYWISE, screaming horribly and          lunging at the kids one last time. IT finally gives up,          slumping to the floor dead, a black charred clownish corpse.                                   Richie touches the remains and they deflates, almost as if a          balloon.                                   The trapdoor above them blows away, as if it were sucked off          by a cyclone, out of the oculus, and into what looks like the          stars of outer space.                                              Did we kill it?                                   Will isn't sure, he looks at the rest of them.                                              You did it, Will.                                   Bev hugs him.   Ben watches, enviously.                                              It's miller ti--                                   Suddenly the GRAVITY SPELL WEARS OFF and the kids all fall to          the ceiling of the stone crypt. Bev almost falls out into          space, caught by Ben just in time.                                   The water from the waterfalls and from the reflecting pool          all collapse back toward the floor, along with some of the          stones in the crypt around them, which begins to crumble.                                   At first the losers hang on, afraid to fall, but eventually          they lose grip and fall toward the oculus, which has begun to          fill up with the water from the falls and reflecting pool.                                   They all plunge safely into the new pool below, Will's foot          kicking out the bottom of it into outer space before being          pulled back by Stan.                                              We've got to get out of here.                                                                                       The losers hurry their way out of the sewers, storm water          quickly rising around them. Will leads the way with a car          flare. They come to another dead-end grate.                                              Shit!                                              We'll get out. C'mon.                                                                                      They continue to look for a way out, the water now up to          their chests. The losers look cold, lost, and in despair.                                              We're going to drown down here                    aren't we?                                                             I'm so cold.                      All this water. It's still                                            going to win.                                              No. I don't know--                                              We're dead. So dead.                                              Guys, stop it. Focus.                                   Everyone turns to Bev. Their muse. Their light.                                                                                                                                                                     SHE TAKES Will'S FACE IN HER HANDS                                                                                       One by one the kids shoot out of a STORM PIPE into the          PENOBSCOT RIVER, just like Georgie's paper boat. They pop up          like tops, blinking owlishly against the daylight.                                   The sky is blue.   The storm has passed.                                                                                      Will, Bev, Mike, Ben, Richie, Eddie and Stan slump soaked,          shivering, and exhausted on the embankment. Derry is in full          view across the river, a red ball setting behind it.                                   They gather themselves on the bank, breathing hard as the          adrenaline of survival courses through their veins.                                              Now can we celebrate?                                              Will?                                   Stan sees an OBJECT GLITTER in the sunlight. He picks it up,          face sober and thoughtful -- an old GLASS COKE BOTTLE. He          takes it by the neck, shatters it against a rock, and                                                             Will knows exactly what this means. He steps up to Stan, who          SLASHES Will'S PALM with the shard. One by one the others          approach, Stan slashing everyone's palms, does his own last.                                              Swear, guys. Swear if IT isn't                    dead, if it ever returns, we'll                    come back and fight it together.                                   They all clasp hands and lock eyes. A BLOOD OATH IS SWORN.                                                                                      Travis, hair now SHOCK WHITE, expression blank and broken,          sits in his chair in front of white fuzz of the TV. His          father's corpse is still on the floor, blood matted          everywhere. POUNDING ON THE FRONT DOOR.                                                                                       Chief Borton and other Derry cops frog march Travis out of          the house in cuffs through a scene of POLICE, NEWS REPORTERS,          and a CORONER CARTING OUT A BODY BAG.                                                                                      Mike races past nurses and doctors, a swell of optimism          building with every stride. He turns the corner into...                                                                                      Leroy's bed is empty. His mom is packing up his dad's things.          She looks up, tears in her eyes. Mike is devastated.                                              But we beat It.    We beat the                    cancer.                                              What are you talking about?                                              Derry.   The clown.    It.                                   Mike's mom takes him into her arms.                                              He's in a better place, Mikey. I                    know it's hard to believe. But you                    have to. Remember what your father                    always said...                                                                                      Leroy shows Mike a baby lamb, freshly born from its mother's          womb.                                              See son, everything has a cycle.                    Just when you think the world                    couldn't get any colder, something                    good always grows.                                                                                      Mike holds his mother tight, remembering, tears rolling down          his cheeks. A PIANO BEGINS TO PLAY...                                                                                       Fur Elise. Will recognizes it as he comes up the front walk.          It comes from INSIDE HIS HOUSE. He races inside, hopeful,          past a box of Georgie's toys left out on the sidewalk.                                                                                                                                                                   Zach and Sharon Denbrough pack the last of the camping gear          on top of the family Wagoneer.                                              Load up!                                   Will stands at the curb with his gang -- Richie, Ben, Bev,          Eddie, Stan, and Mike. They hand him a present.                                              We all pitched in.                                              Well Richie mostly.                                              I had to mow like five hundred                    lawns. Stan smoked the clippings.                                    What does that even mean?       You gonna open it?                                   Will does. Inside is a VINTAGE PENTAX CAMERA.                                              We hear Arcadia's pretty amazing                    this time of year.                                              Take some pictures for us.                                              Thanks.                                                             They have a group hug.                                               Willy c'mon!                                                                                      They pull out of the driveway, camera on Will's lap. Zach and          Sharon smile back affectionately from the front seat.                                   Will turns to see his friends wave bon voyage with their          SCARRED HANDS. A reminder of an oath to be kept.

"                            Screenplay by              Bryan Woods, Scott Beck & John Krasinski                            Story by                     Bryan Woods & Scott Beck     We hear, very clearly, the sound of light wind.     We come up on... a streetlight. There is no illumination...    and no movement. We hold on it for a long moment when    suddenly... The streetlight bobs... and then begins to sway.    We slowly begin to rise up on the streetlight to reveal... a    small bird has landed on it. We continue to rise to reveal,    behind the bird...    Wind blows through the   gargantuan evergreens that seem to    engulf the narrow main   street of a small town in upstate New    York. Shop windows and   cars on either side covered in dust,    the place seems frozen   in time. There is no movement.    In the very middle of the road one can see... sand. A bizarre    incongruity, a long pathway about a shovels width runs the    full length of the street with offshoots into open doorways    of some of the shops.    We hold for a long moment:     Slowly pushing through the doorway of a large general store,    also covered in dust. To the left, a cash register with small    shelves of nearly empty candy boxes below. To the right, a    towering shelf full of bags of potato chips, nacho chips and    pretzels... None are missing.     WE MOVE SLOWLY across the floor, down the middle of a general    store. Amid the towering shelves of goods on either side, one    may recognize a barely perceptible pattern of which shelves    are bare and which are not. There is no movement. No sound.    Suddenly... TINY FEET JUMP INTO OUR MOVING FRAME! Then, as    fast as they appeared... They're gone.    WE NOW MOVE UP the side of the store, looking down one    aisle... and the next. As we arrive at the next aisle we    catch a glimpse of... A SMALL DARK FIGURE!!! And then its    gone.    WE CONTINUE along the side of the store until we arrive at    the last aisle. At the far end of the store we see...     a counter. With a window.     And shelves.   Suddenly... A WOMAN     WE GO CLOSE ON THE WOMAN as she scans the shelves, slowly    lowering herself to the ground until behind her we see... an    8 year old boy sitting slumped against the wall... HE IS    BAREFOOT. On closer inspection we see sweat on the boy's    brow, his skin pale from fever. The woman's knee touches down    on the ground next to the boy as... she sees what she's been    looking for. She reaches out her hand.    WE GO CLOSE ON HER HAND as it reaches toward a shelf... of    orange prescription drug bottles. Her hand suddenly begins to    shift certain bottles ever so slightly... AT A BIZARRELY SLOW    PACE... she does not make a sound. As she does this, we get    our first glimpse... of names. Names of drugs. Names... of    people.    HER HAND finally arrives at the very back of the shelf as she    gently twists a bottle that reads... AMOXICILLIN.    ON THE MOTHER... as she inhales slowly? And then, as if    doing surgery, she slowly closes her hand around the bottle    and GENTLY begins to move it through the shelf toward her.    Her hand, once again moves incredibly slowly, her now wider    closed hand shifts even more bottles as it passes. JUST as    she gets to the end of the shelf a bottle shifts... with a    RATTLE of pills. This is the first, deliberate sound we've    heard. The mother... FREEZES!!!!    WE RACK FOCUS to the boy on the ground, who now looks up...    with panic. The mother's eyes look all around the room...    The way one does when they are waiting for something...    LISTENING for something. After a long moment... she pulls    the bottle in her hand the final few inches... and off the    shelf.    The mother draws a huge breath of relief. As she stands up,    we reveal, just over the counter... TWO EYES LOOKING UP AT      A 10 year old girl stands on her toes, barely able to see    over the wooden counter to... her mother. She smiles at her    mother... and gives her a thumbs up. With that... she's off.    WE FOLLOW HER as she runs lightly through the store... she is    also barefoot.    The GIRL turns down an aisle to reveal... a small boy sitting    on the floor... He too is barefoot.     As the girl approaches we see, in the thick dust on the floor    he has drawn... a rocket ship. She sits with him.    He silently puts his hand to his chest, palm to the side...    crosses his first two fingers of his other hand with    deliberate focus... and then slowly puts his two hands    together. He then looks up at her... and quickly shoots his    crossed fingers into the air... like a rocket. She beams    with pride for a moment and then... Signs back to him.               Very good job!               ....That's how... we get away.    The girl's smile falls ever so slightly. Then the boy    suddenly... TAPS her on the shoulder and scurries away...    She's ""it"".    As the girl slowly gets up to follow him, we see for the    first time... A HEARING AID...    The boy disappears around a corner...     The girl comes around the tall shelf into the next aisle when    suddenly... her eyes go wide!!! What she sees is the boy    standing on a small box, STRETCHING to reach a toy on a high    shelf. She walks quickly to him when suddenly... the toy     The girl instinctively SLIDES to the ground and catches the    toy JUST as it's about to hit the ground! On her face we can    see she is TERRIFIED! She closes her eyes, taking a breath    with relief. When she opens them, in the foreground, we see    the toy she is holding... a small TOY SPACE SHUTTLE. Then in    the distance past the toy we see... a FIGURE.    She sits up to see a man standing outside the door of the    general store, holding a large box with what looks like a    quilt hanging out of it. A look of fear on his face...    softens, as he mimes wiping his brow with relief. She smiles,    puts the toy back on a shelf and runs to him.     The father gently puts the box on the ground and pulls back    the pieces of thick quilt to reveal that all the contents are    actually wrapped in it. He then reaches for a LARGE HIKING BACK PACK, and beginstransferring the contents of the box into the bag. As hedoes, we see... cans of food, a variety of prescriptionpills, bandages and wrapped syringes.The girl arrives at his side and excitedly starts rummagingthrough the box as well. As she does, we see... thickpaintbrushes, bottles of glue, bottles of lighter fluid and astack of old newspapers. Then... her face lights up. Fromthe box, she pulls out a SALVAGED SECURITY CAMERA with wiresexposed. The girl gives it a brief once over and thenremoves... two exposed CIRCUIT BOARDS, very obviously onlyrecently removed from whatever appliance they belonged to.The girl scans the boards with a voracity, pointing out tothe father particular areas of interest. Her father can'thelp but smile.Suddenly, the box of Amoxicillin comes into frame and isplaced on top... along with two boxes of sugar. The fatherlooks up at his wife. After a beat... she signs:           For my tea.He just keeps looking at her.           Fine. I have a sweet tooth.The father smiles and is about to close the bag when... acandy bar is placed on top.           Me too!The father looks up at her with fake incredulity. Suddenlythe sick son in his mother's arms weakly signs:           Me too.The whole family laughs silently as the daughter GENTLY takesanother candy bar from a box below the cash register... Wecan now see why the boxes are almost empty.The father looks back to his arriving four year old son,expecting the same, but from behind his back the young boyreveals... the toy space shuttle.With a sweet empathy the father reaches for the toy... andshakes his head no. He turns the toy over and silentlyexplains it has batteries... this toy can make noise.     The little boy watches, confused... hurt, as his father    gently places the space shuttle on the counter. And then    gently grabs a big lollipop and puts it in the bag for the    boy.    The mother hands their sick son to the father who picks him    up and walks out. The mother kisses her 4 year old on the    head, shuffles the hiking bag onto her back and walks out    too.    The daughter looks at the boy as tears begin to fill his    eyes. She smiles and signs:               It's ok.    The boy shakes his head no.    After a moment... the girl looks back to see if her parents    are there. She then reaches up and takes the shuttle down    from the counter. With wide eyes her little brother watches    as she surgically removes the batteries... and places the    shuttle in the hood of her brother's sweatshirt. Covering it    from view, she holds a finger up to her lips in the    obligatory big sister way of telling him not to get her in    trouble... He beams!    She then stands up and places the batteries back on the    counter, smiles at her brother and gestures ""let's go"".     The daughter exits the General Store and follows her mother    and father, who are walking down the street only stepping on    the sand path. Their steps are almost silent.    After a moment... her four year old brother follows behind    her. We watch everyone walk in total silence.    Then...     We slowly push in to the counter of the store and then    realize... THE BATTERIES ARE GONE!     A long road slices its way through a heavily wooded area,    which further blocks the already fading sun.      In WIDE PROFILE we see the family walking in a line,     continuing only on a sand path. The father is in front     carrying their sick son, then the mother with the backpack,     then their blonde daughter... and trailing a bit behind     rumbles their robust 4 year old.      From the ground we look up at an old and rusted bridge     towering over us eerily... the sand path continues across it.     WE TRACK WITH THE FAMILY as they walk across the bridge...     There are minor creaks underneath the sand.     Suddenly we see... the four year old stops just before the     entrance of bridge. The family continues... not seeing him.     WE FOLLOW THE BOY'S HANDS as he fishes around in his hood and     pulls out... THE TOY SHUTTLE.     HEAD ON, we walk with the father, each member of his proud     brood can be seen walking behind him. We can hear his     strained breath... and the tiniest swish of the footsteps in     sand.     HEAD ON, walking with the daughter... we now suddenly hear     nothing. As she looks to be in her own world... So we are in     hers. A smile breaks on her face as she walks and breathes in     total silence. We walk with her for a long moment, when     suddenly behind her...      The girl does not turn. She just keeps walking. Still     smiling. As she looks up to her mother, we go into:      - FROM THE GIRLS'S POV, we see her mother and father spin     around with a frantic shock on their faces.     - BACK ON THE GIRL. She looks confused at her parents     behavior... LIGHTS AGAIN FLASH EERILY BEHIND HER.     - ON THE FATHER rushing to put the boy on the ground and     turning to run.     - ON THE MOTHER, spinning around with terror in her eyes...     she looks to be holding in a SCREAM.     - BACK ON THE GIRL slowly beginning to turn around at what     her parents could be looking at as we:  A loud playful beeping rushes in... from the blinkingshuttle.Then, from the woods we hear... THE MOST UNMISTAKEABLE - ON THE MOTHER as she slowly lowers the backpack to theground... and her legs begin to fail her.- ON THE FATHER running, violently shaking his head... Itlooks like he's HOLDING IN A SCREAM.- THE TREES BEHIND THEM... RUSTLE AND SNAP as somethingbarrels through.- ON THE BOY... holding up his space ship proudly to hisincoming father... an enormous smile on his face.- ON THE FATHER... 20 feet away... his face is a still frameof pure fear as he runs to camera. Then: ... A SHRIEK?... A SCREAM?   ... A CRUNCH?   Then...ON THE FATHER as... a thin line of blood splatters on hisface.- Mid run, the father's body immediately goes limp... failinghim as he comes to a halt just in front of camera.- Then, as quickly as it came... THE SOUND IS GONE.- IN WIDE PROFILE, The father stands lifeless... The twochildren stand frozen with fear... the MOTHER drops to herknees and... a space shuttle blinks silently in the sand.The four year old... IS GONE.Once again... only the wind can be heard.         Still in BLACK... A new sound... Almost like that of the     ocean.      The new sound continues. In the last of the day's sunlight:     WE TRACK, LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN, on... what appears to be an     empty beach. The pink lit sand, now combined with a sound     like the ocean, feels serene, almost otherworldly.     Slowly coming into frame, we see the face of... the daughter.     This is REGAN ABBOTT. Her hair is much longer. She is now     TWO YEARS OLDER, 12. She just looks... different.     REGAN lays in the sand with eyes closed... but she is not     asleep.     With her brow furrowed and her closed eyes darting back and     forth she looks oddly pained... almost as if she is wishing     herself to another place.     There is movement in her hands as her fingers caress an     object.     Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN as she sits up violently CLOSE UP     INTO OUR FRAME! She looks around with eyes wet and red,     attempting to regain her bearings.     WE SLOWLY MOVE AROUND her to see what she sees and are met     with... a jarringly incongruous landscape! Instead of a     glistening ocean, there in front of REGAN stand the tall     swaying stalks of... A CORNFIELD.     As REGAN looks to her lap WE SLOWLY TRAVEL DOWN to reveal...     she is holding THE TOY SHUTTLE. As she maneuvers it through     her fingers we see the shuttle is damaged... there are 2     large gouges in the fuselage.     Suddenly... Something startles her as she snaps her head to     the side!     WE GO CLOSE on her hand driving the TOY SHUTTLE into the     sand, not wanting it to be seen. Now ONLY THE SHUTTLE'S TAIL     is exposed in the foreground as we see a figure walking     toward REGAN.     Coming into focus is... her mother. This is EVELYN ABBOTT.     EVELYN too has changed. Hair longer... frame lower. She     carries a basket of vegetables. She is bare foot.     EVELYN stops and looks down at her daughter giving her a     comforting smile. REGAN can't seem to return the same.      EVELYN gently gestures with her head. REGAN nods... and     EVELYN walks on. After a moment... REGAN places the TOY     SHUTTLE into the large pocket in her dress and follows her     mother. As she goes:     WE PAN TO FOLLOW REGAN as she joins her mother and then     SLOWLY RISE to reveal that the two women are walking along...     A LONG AND WIDE SAND PATH IN THE MIDDLE OF A FARM! In the     distance we can see they are heading to... A WEATHERED RED      WE END OUR RISE just as we reveal in the foreground...     Christmas lights? Like parallel telephone wires, 2 cables of     large bulbs, one with red and one with white. They dance     playfully in the wind.      CLOSE UP PROFILE of a steering wheel in the foreground. A     weathered CHEVY emblem reflects the fire orange sky in the     background.     HANDS come into frame and gently grip the steering wheel.     The right hand then slowly moves to the ignition block... and     turns. There is no sound. After a moment, the hand turns     again...again without sound. The hand turns a third time...     this time, the hand begins to bob ever so slightly... as if     the old car has started up. As the hand retracts:     WE PULL BACK to reveal... The little brother. This is MARCUS     ABBOTT, now 10. Moving ever so slightly, MARCUS is obviously     pretending to drive... though his impassive face betrays the     idea that he is having any fun. MARCUS seems to have aged     much more than the mere 2 years. His vacant eyes tell us a     large toll has been taken on him, though perhaps not as     easily recognizable on the exterior.      WE MOVE SLOWLY IN POV along another large sand path with high     grass on either side when suddenly it opens up into a large     clearing and we see... a tractor?... Shells of untouched farm     equipment litter the open area.     WE SLOWLY MOVE LEFT, making our way through, what is now     nothing more than an eery farming vehicle graveyard.     Suddenly... A DARK FIGURE ENTERS THE FRAME.       MARCUS's hands move silently along the steering wheel as he     stares out the windshield. His body moves ever so slightly,     his face... relaxes... the hint of a smile. For a moment we     could almost believe he is driving. His eyes routinely check     the side mirror, then the rearview mirror... then stop. His     hands... and face fall.     THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, we see a figure standing behind     the truck amidst the sea of farm equipment. Behind the figure     we see... A TOWERING SILO.      OVER THE DARK FIGURE onto the truck as we see MARCUS expertly     slip out of the cab window of a VINTAGE CHEVY PICKUP that     sits at the edge of a DESCENDING DRIVEWAY connecting to the     road that heads back toward the BARN. He lands in the sand     without a sound and begins to walk, head held low, toward the     dark figure... who reaches his hand out and briefly touches     Marcus' shoulder. Marcus walks straight past.     As MARCUS exits we BOOM UP the dark figure as it turns,     revealing... LEON ABBOTT (LEE), 38. LEE too has changed,     though much more obviously. He has lost weight on his strong     farmer frame, he wears a beard and his sunken eyes indicate     that he hasn't slept well... in a long time.     WE PULL BACK WIDE to reveal the sea of farm equipment sits in     front of a long, dilapidated, work shed roof... a makeshift     repair shop. The word `REPAIR' is written in flaking white     paint that clings to the wood above.      The line of Christmas lights dance in the foreground.     WE TILT DOWN to see that the lights run right in between...     two towering doors of a weathered red BARN. The doors have     been left open by a gap of just over 2 feet. The edges of     the doors... are wrapped in foam...     Suddenly MARCUS walks into frame... and enters the barn.      WE TILT DOWN from the lines of unilluminated Christmas lights     running below the high reaching ceiling and...      ONTO MARCUS' BACK as he walks through two heavy quilts at the     entry of the barn hanging from the ceiling. Through the     quilts, a dirt floor guides us through this... barn? The     surroundings are too difficult to fully comprehend at first     glance.     To the left are several large horse stalls. WE QUICKLY PAN     INSIDE to see they are now... bedrooms. Mattresses,     perfectly made up, lie on the floor next to lamps and small     stacks of books. Clothes on hangers dangle between each of     the bars providing not only storage, but limited privacy.     To the right is a large pen with railings. Once a holding     area for cows awaiting milking, it is now... a living room.     Hay bales draped in blankets and old wooden chairs surround     an overturned pig trough, now serving as a coffee table     covered in books and dripping candles.     As MARCUS continues we notice the walls. Every inch is     meticulously covered in a bizarre but elegant cornucopia     of... trash. Foam, cardboard, and old newspapers are glued to     the wall in thick layers.     If one were able to look past the obvious first assumption of     a hovel or domicile of hoarders, they would see almost... a     deliberate beauty in the decor... A warmth. This is a well     maintained and loving... home.     WE FOLLOW ON MARCUS' BACK as he suddenly comes to... A     MATTRESS LAYING ON THE GROUND? MARCUS bends down and after a     brief struggle pushes the mattress to one side to reveal... A     large hole...     WE FOLLOW JUST BEHIND MARCUS... as he descends down the     ground...      WE NOW SEE MARCUS has descended a makeshift stairwell into...     A small excavated room illuminated by work lights. Lodged up     against the walls and across the ceiling are wooden beams.     In between each beam are varying stages of an elaborate     process of insulation and sound proofing that consists of a     thick layer of newspaper as a base and then blankets and     pillows squeezed in on top. There is a hay bale up against     one wall and a mattress leaned up against another.     In the middle of the room, MARCUS walks past... EVELYN, who     is bent over behind an odd wooden box. Suddenly she stands     up, holding a beautiful and delicate... baby mobile.     As she turns and reaches the mobile high in the air to a beam     above her we get a clear shot... of her protruding belly. Even a layman guess would put her over 8 months. EVELYNgently taps the mobile as we:ARE NOW CLOSE ON the small ducks and clouds moving throughthe air, EVELYN below looking up... with a smile.MARCUS sits down next to REGAN who is on the floor next to astack of old newspapers and bottles of glue.She removes a large sheet of newspaper from a plastic tray ofglue, lets it drip... and then applies it to the wall with athick paintbrush. As she moves the paintbrush vertically downthe dripping white, a piece of an image can be seen... It isa bra ad. REGAN slowly looks over to MARCUS... who stares atit.BACK ON EVELYN as she removes the top of the odd wooden box.WE FOLLOW her hands in to reveal... a heavily quilted insidewith adorable baby blankets, a small teddy bear... and aclear plastic air mask??EVELYN's fingers fumble with something in the corner untilshe finally threads through... a thin plastic tube... andconnects it to the air mask. It looks similar to anemergency breathing apparatus one might see in an ambulanceor hospital... because it is.BACK ON MARCUS, as he now removes a large piece of drippingnewspaper out of the tray and places it on the wall. Like hissister, he swipes his thick paintbrush vertically down thedripping white, this time partially revealing a front pageheadline. It reads... MARCUS looks at it inquisitively... and then swipes thepaintbrush horizontally across the whole headline.It reads: MARCUS freezes... then looks below to see the top of a grainynewspaper photograph. All we can make out is... a twistedhuman arm. His hand slowly begins to shake as he raises thepaintbrush to reveal the rest of the image... when suddenly: MARCUS JUMPS!!!!!... Only to see his mom holding a pillowover the newspaper with a knowing look. After a beat, shehands MARCUS a long piece of tape to secure the pillow to thewall.       ON THE BACK OF... LEE, perched on what looks like the top of     the world.     From this great height we get our first WIDE SHOT of the     large farm that we now see sits in a clearing on a ridge...     surrounded by the tangled forest of the APPALACHIAN      A puff of smoke rises from LEE's silhouette as he suddenly     raises a hand into frame... and checks his watch. A moment     later... As if on cue...     A line of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS flicker to life above the wide     sand path REGAN was laying on.     Another line of white Christmas lights flicker on... this     time revealing a path that connects the weathered red BARN...     to an old white FARMHOUSE. Then another line of lights...     and another! Like the image of a city power grid coming back     to life, we see a labyrinth of countless sand paths,     meticulously laid out, illuminate all over the farm in a     beautiful expanse.     NOW IN PROFILE, LEE stares down... seemingly at nothing. The     unfiltered cigarette burns to his fingers, causing LEE to     snap out of his stupor. He looks around at the horizon, it is     officially sundown. He reaches for a plastic bottle of...     Lighter fluid... and sprays all its contents into a shallow     metal drum in front of him.     Another cigarette appears from below frame. He puts it in his     mouth and then reaches his hands... into his jacket. His     right arm jiggles slightly. There is no sound. His arm     jiggles again. Then from his jacket, LEE pulls... a FULLY LIT     LIGHTER, that he protects from the wind. He lights his     cigarette and then leans his hands to the metal drum... A      In the glowing orange we see LEE take a long drag of his     cigarette. His face has no affect. After several moments the     flame begins to weaken and slowly fade.     Suddenly, far FAR off in the distance on the ridge... ANOTHER     FLAME ILLUMINATES. LEE doesn't even look up. Then, miles     past the first... ANOTHER FLAME!... THEN ANOTHER! Until we     can see behind LEE 5 glowing fires scattered far off across     the ridge.     ON LEE as he glances over and registers... then back to     staring front as we:      MOVE AROUND BEHIND him to see where his gaze is focused.     Then... we see it. There, in his left hand LEE holds... A 5X6     nursery school photo of a 4 year old boy.     LEE takes a last drag of his cigarette... and then places the     photo in a small box at his feet.     WE ARE TIGHT ON THE BOX as LEE stands and walks toward two     curved bars on the side of the SILO. He turns around... and     begins to descend A LADDER.     WE HOLD ON THE SMALL BOX... then just as LEE's head     disappears... WE SLOWLY BEGIN TO RISE.     Now looking at the opposite side of the ridge than we did in     the beginning, the rising moon's light now spills across the     vista of rock and trees and onto an enormous and bizarrely     out of place.... CRATER!     WE HOLD ON THE CRATER FOR A LONG MOMENT... Then:      WE ARE CLOSE on a small mound of dirt. Suddenly two hands     covered in winter gloves enter frame and begin to dig down     about 3 inches to reveal... a plank of wood.     WIDER NOW, we see EVELYN on her hands and knees just behind     the living room set up in an open, very make-shift kitchen.     One wall of shelves cluttered with stacks of paper plates,     bowls and cups. Another wall is a workbench acting as a     counter top and a mid 70's refrigerator.     EVELYN extracts from the dirt a long wooden box. Beneath     it... red hot rocks let off a combination of steam and smoke.     EVELYN brings the box to the counter top and carefully lifts     the lid to reveal... a perfectly cooked fish with lemon and     rosemary and garlic scattered all around.      WE TRACK with REGAN as she walks down the row of horse stall     bedrooms.     REGAN arrives at the threshold of LEE and EVELYN's bedroom.     LEE is faced away from her, washing his face in a long trough     like sink that runs the length of the room. Suddenly,     through the mirror leaning on the wall, LEE sees her... But     does not turn.      Through the mirror, the two of them looking silently at each     other for a moment too long... it is heartbreaking.     REGAN pathetically gestures ""eating"". As LEE nods, trying to     muster a polite smile we can see very clearly... something is     broken.     LEE wipes his face with a towel and then turns to face... an     empty doorway.      The family sits down together for dinner... around an old     workbench. Their heads bowed in prayer, after a moment     EVELYN lifts her head and they begin to eat. There are no     plates. The food sits on various children's plastic     placemats. There are no utensils... The family uses only     bread to collect food. We slowly pull back on this silent...     but comfortingly familiar scene.      REGAN and MARCUS lie on the floor playing... Monopoly.     By the dim light of an oil lantern... we can see the game's     board is the same, but the pieces are small colored bobbles     of wool, the kind you would find on a children's Christmas     sweater. The houses and hotels are empty sugar packets, blue     and pink. And the money?... Small pieces of green, red, blue     and orange fabric rectangles... all equally sized.     MARCUS is five spaces away from his sister's hotel on     Boardwalk. He takes a sip of water and places the cup on top     of a tall crate being used as a makeshift side table. MARCUS     looks at his sister, who can't hide her smile. He mimes a     prayer before rolling the dice on the dirt floor, where it     makes no noise............... 5!     MARCUS slowly looks up to REGAN, knowing his fate. REGAN     smiles pointedly and then reaches for MARCUS' money. As     MARCUS thrusts his arm back to protect his bank, his elbow...     hits the oil lantern!!     A BOOMING CRASH!!!! As the oil lantern hits the ground and     shatters. THE SOUND FEELS HUGE!.. AS IT IS THE FIRST BIG     SOUND WE'VE HEARD! FIRE ERUPTS ON THE FLOOR!!! The children     stare frozen in horror!     LEE immediately jumps up from the table and instinctively     grabs a quilt and throws it on the fire. With a few silent     pats... the fire is gone.   REGAN shoots MARCUS a look... of concern. MARCUS shoots LEE alook... of terror. LEE shoots a look... to the roof.       ON LEE as he stands up INTO frame. He has almost physically      transformed from a man... into protection incarnate. He      slowly raises a stiff finger to his lips, his body so      tense... it looks painful. This is the unwanted version of      himself that lies just millimeters under his skin... 24 hours      a day.      After a long moment... nothing... It would have happened by      now...      LEE finally nods that everything is OK. MARCUS stares at      REGAN with a painfully apologetic face as she leans in and      touches his hand.       The whole family startles in silence!!!      ... Something has hit the roof.       Seconds later a high pitched SHRIEEEEEEK of CLAWS sliding      down the aluminum roof. The family follows the sound exactly      with their eyes. Then silence.      LEE crouches down and walks to a small window where the sound      stopped above. MARCUS wildly shakes his head ""no"", evidence      of his traumatic anxiety resurfacing. REGAN slowly stands,      looking on with wide eyes.      LEE arrives at the window, crouched. From his low vantage      point we can see the lip of the gutter... and the eerily      swaying Christmas lights.      LEE begins to stand up slowly, his face now virtually pressed      against the glass.      Suddenly, A WHIR OF SCREECHING AND GROWLING!!! A LARGE SHAPE       ... As two raccoons hit the ground, fighting... then scamper      off into the dark.      LEE somehow exhales slowly and calmly... a trick that, no      doubt, took much practice... and walks away from the window.       The two raccoons round the corner onto a moonlit path heading      toward camera.. Just as they come into CLOSE UP...       HEAD... and then rips it out of frame. We hold on the second     raccoon running off with a soft but piercing scream.      It is night. From high above, we look down to the sand path     between the RED BARN and the WHITE FARMHOUSE. In the     foreground we see the shadow of a telephone pole. Sitting on     the wire in silhouette... are BIRDS.      FROM THE GROUND, we see the FARMHOUSE in the distance... but     something is different. The color seems wrong... the angle is     odd. The foreground is over exposed and tiny dots fly in and     out of the frame.     Suddenly... A GIANT FOOT STEPS INTO FRAME!!!!     ... AND THEN ANOTHER... as we watch two bare feet... then the     hem of a dress... and then the silhouette of... EVELYN walk     silently toward the house.      WE SLOWLY PULL BACK from THAT SAME SHOT of the FARMHOUSE and     reveal... a plastic frame... A red light... buttons. We     realize this image is being viewed... on a small monitor.     CCTV FOOTAGE... from A SECURITY CAMERA.     WE CONTINUE TO PULL BACK SLOWLY as ... Another monitor comes     into frame... with another stacked on top of it... then one     next to it... and another... until we reveal, like something     out of a Dr. Seuss book, a wall of 20 TV's, all shapes and     brands sit on top of a large workbench covered with open     notebooks and sliced up newspapers. On each screen we see     elements of trees... sand paths... the barn... the silo.     This is a DIY version of a security console that overlooks     the entire farm... and it has taken a long time to put     together.     WE BEGIN TO TRACK past the empty security console and onto a     cinder block wall... covered in notes and newspaper     clippings. Then...  Suddenly a portion of one visible newspaper clipping shows aclose up and much more detailed image of... the enormouscrater. The headline reads: A post-it note sticks to the clipping that reads: WE PASS BY more clippings, catching glimpses of dramaticheadlines and surreal images:  WE PASS BY a grainy newspaper photo of a military standoff... With ONE creature. The headline reads: ...AGAIN WE HEAR THAT FAMILIAR SOUND as it gets louder.WE CONTINUE TO TRAVEL as... A MAP enters frame. Like one youwould get at a gas station, it is covered in illustratedforests and rivers... it is a map of THE STATE OF NEW YORK.The portion above Manhattan... is covered in hand drawn redcircles and pins, each accompanied with a date and names...of the dead.WE MOVE FURTHER ALONG to reveal... low quality stills ofsecurity footage barely showing... THE CREATURE. Each stillis drawn on and analyzed. Then... a large white boardcovered in writing comes into frame, leaning against thewall. Amidst the scratches of written and rewritten thoughts,we can make out two lists labeled, `QUESTIONS' and In the `QUESTIONS' column are listed; ""NO DEMANDS?"", ""NO SIGN In the `CONFIRMED' column are phrases like; ""4-6 CONFIRMED INPACK""..., ""DO NOT ATTACK SMALL SOUNDS"". Then we see the phrase WE MOVE TO the very bottom of the white board where we seethe word... ""WEAPON???""...Listed below words are crossed out... ""EXPLOSIVES""...        WE MOVE OFF OF THE white board and scan past ANATOMICAL     DRAWINGS of A SHARK SENSING PREY USING MAGNETIC FIELDS,      SPECTRUM and finally images of... THE INNER EAR...     WE NOW MOVE THROUGH meticulously organized shelves covered in     tools... and wires... and various pieces of salvaged     electronic equipment and finally onto...     LEE'S BACK. He is hunched over the workbench working     intensely on something... he is wearing large black     headphones. We see him reach out of frame as we:     WE PUSH PAST an old microphone that is connected to... AN OLD     TRANSATLANTIC HAM RADIO. In the glowing light from the box we     see all kinds of knobs and needles. Below a switch labeled     with two stickers that say ""RADIO"" and ""SPEAKER"", LEE'S hand     comes into frame and turns a large knob revealing... THE       Suddenly... he presses down on a button on the microphone...       WE follow LEE's hand off of the button and onto... a small     soldering iron. As he picks it up:     WE GO TO LEE at his workspace. With magnifying glasses in     front of his eyes, he works with surgery like precision... on     a small contraption. A small string of smoke rises from his     work.      WE ARE OVER the warmly, lit from above, stairwell with LEE at     his work station in the background as...     Delicate bare feet touch down softly, and deliberately on the     steps... Like a child knowing where to step so they don't     wake their parents.     WE BOOM UP to reveal... EVELYN as she stares at her husband,     who hasn't heard her, worried?... Admiring?... Lost? A flicker of a memory echoes through her face as she smilesand then walks to him... EVELYN IS WEARING EAR BUDS.ON LEE as a hand touches down gently on his shoulder... hedoesn't flinch at all. There is immediate recognitionthere... Safety. The hands then reach down... and removeLee's headphones. The sound of the searching radio in theheadphones is nearly inaudible.LEE sits back and holds up... A HEARING AID. It looks like asomewhat common hearing aid... but with handcraftedmodifications...upgrades. There is a wire extension thatextends from the top... almost like an adapter or plug.The hands gently grab LEE's face and turn it. LEE looks upat EVELYN who he now sees... is wearing lipstick, has pulledher hair back... and has changed into a beautiful dress.This... is DATE NIGHT. LEE smiles as EVELYN takes a stepback and with the gentlest of movements, she sweetly beckonshim to her.LEE looks back at his work for just a moment, his face onceagain... focused. Then he lays the hearing aid down on thetable... and stands up.WE HOLD ON THE HEARING AID and then SLOWLY PULL BACK toreveal... a pile of more hearing aids, each with a variety ofdifferent modifications, scattered all around his work bench.This is something he has been working on for a long while.WE TILT UP from the workbench to see... LEE arrive at hiswife's side as she puts her hand up on his neck and smiles upat him warmly, as if there is no where else to be... nothingto make her happier.FACE TO FACE NOW, LEE finally allows a smile, looking down athis time tested partner.EVELYN's eyes close as she places her forehead to his and thetwo begin to gently sway... in total silence.Suddenly... EVELYN takes LEE's hands from around her back...and places them on her protruding belly. After a moment shelooks up lovingly at her husband to see... Knowing this man inside and out, EVELYN keeps her gaze firmlyinto her husband's eyes and slowly moves her hands up LEE'Sarms and gently onto his face. Holding more than his visagein her hands... LEE finally looks up at her.      EVELYN smiles with recognition of the man she married as her     right hand travels to her right ear. She removes the earbud     from her ear... and seamlessly places it in his, as:      The only record on the record player, this is the song they     were married to. This is...      Perhaps it's due to the lack of sound thus far in the     movie... or maybe the marrying image of the two dancing, but     the sounds of the song are crystal clear. We can perfectly     hear every chord, every tremor of vocal chord as we:     PULL BACK on this perfect moment... through the basement...     to the small rectangular basement window to reveal... water     hitting the glass.      We see a strong rain pouring down around the house.      A beautiful crisp morning.      FROM THE PORCH of the farmhouse, as water drips down from     overhead, WE SLOWLY travel along the sand path toward the     barn when suddenly we arrive at... a small stream of water     cutting right through a, now washed away, segment of the sand     path.     Suddenly LEE's bare feet enter frame... and then a large     hiking backpack enters frame next to him.     ON LEE as we see a momentary glimpse into the painstaking,     and never ending, workload that goes into maintaining this     farm.     CLOSE on hands as LEE's bare fingers gouge into the     unforgiving earth at the edge of the sand path to divert the     water. Stones come into frame to form a temporary wall.     Then... LEE hoists, the very obviously heavy, hiking bag onto     his knee. He then slowly and silently undoes a handmade flap     at the bottom of the backpack. From the opening of the bag     pours... SAND.      Quickly and silently, sand piles up on the ground as we     witness for the first time, LEE's ingenious system that has     kept his family safe all this time.      CLOSE UP OF A GAUGE... Very faint bursts of air can be heard.     WE SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal EVELYN sitting on a hay bale...     with a blood pressure sleeve on her arm and a stethoscope in     her ears. Behind her is a shelf full of bandages and IV bags.     She stops pumping the bulb, stares down at the gauge... and     then gently lets the air out and removes the sleeve.     EVELYN marks her daily blood pressure on a calendar next to     her. On this calendar we see... her estimated due date is 4     weeks away.     After a moment, she leans over and places the bottom part of     the stethoscope... onto her belly.     A faint sound of adjusting and then...       WE CREEP SLOWLY ALONG the sand path heading toward the front     door of the FARMHOUSE. Suddenly... REGAN steps into frame,     walking deliberately... as if tiptoeing.      REGAN reaches the front door of the FARMHOUSE... and stops at     the threshold. As she looks down at the worn wood floor,     scanning, we can notice... deliberately painted markings on     the floor.     Just then, REGAN takes a dramatically long step inside,     placing her foot down... directly on the first colored     marking... silence. Looking almost relieved, REGAN once     again scans the floor and then focuses on another marking.     She takes another long step, this time far to her right...     and touches down on the next marking... silence. It almost     looks like she's playing `TWISTER'. Getting more confident,     she scans the room, finds another spot and steps quickly.       WE LOOK DIRECTLY up the basement stairs toward the warm     hallway at the top.     Suddenly... REGAN takes a long step into frame.   Her     silhouette looks down the dark stairwell.     After a moment, she slowly puts her foot down on the first     step... when suddenly...       CLOSE ON REGAN... as she is placed down onto the sand path.      AS REGAN spins around we see... LEE kneeling in front of her.                You CANNOT go down there!                 You know why.                I won't make a sound!!! I'm not a               child!!!     LEE pauses... that line stings.                Just... don't.     The two stare into each other's eyes communicating more than     any sign language could.     Suddenly... LEE reaches up to her face?... His still dirty     hands push the hair back over her right ear? It seems so     uncharacteristically warm and gentle when suddenly...     LEE reaches into his pocket with his right hand and pulls     out... THE HEARING AID from the night before.                This time, I was able to use small               amplifiers from the stereo speaker               to--                   It won't work.                  No, our problem has always been                 power, but this should increase the                 frequency to--                  It never works!!                  ... But we'll keep trying til it                 does.     REGAN looks up at him blankly... as LEE reaches to bring the     new hearing aid up to her ear when suddenly...     REGAN pushes his hand away.     LEE reaches up to her ear to try again... REGAN pushes his     hand away again, giving him a cold stare. With so much     history behind it... It's a bizarrely heartbreaking     altercation.     He tries again... she pushes again... even harder.     LEE looks at his daughter as she looks at him... her venomous     face, betrayed by the large tears that roll down her cheek.     After a long moment... REGAN snatches the hearing aid from     her father's hand and walks away.      ON MARCUS' back as he scribbles in a notebook. WE GO CLOSE to     see... MARCUS is writing in a math notebook. His pencil     suddenly pauses, moves up the page through a long math     problem... and stops again. Suddenly... a finger comes into     frame.... and points at a different part of the problem.     WE PULL   OUT to reveal... EVELYN and MARCUS sitting in a small     curated   area with a desk, book shelves and a white board     covered   in various phrases, shapes and equations. We suddenly     realize   EVELYN... is HOME SCHOOLING him!     MARCUS suddenly nods and once again begins writing as EVELYN     looks out the small door of the hay loft and down to the sand     path below... As LEE arrives. Suddenly...                  ...please don't make me go...      EVELYN looks over to see MARCUS's face... awash with panic.                You will be fine. Your father will               always protect you.     MARCUS GRABS HER ARM TIGHT!... IT STARTLES HER.   With tears     in his eyes, he mouths to her... ""PLEASE!""                Listen to me... It is important               that you learn these things. He               just wants you to be able to take               care of yourself...     MARCUS looks at her.                Take care of ME!     EVELYN lightens the conversation by pretending to age in     front of our eyes.                ... when I'm old... and grey...     EVELYN leans on him.    MARCUS can't help but smile.                ...and I have no teeth...     EVELYN pretending to have no teeth... is too much for MARCUS     to hold back his silent laugh.      OVER LEE'S large shoulder we barely see MARCUS... moving ever     so slightly in one direction and then another.     ON LEE, with a large hiking pack on his back.   He adjusts the     straps of a backpack on MARCUS.                Too tight?     MARCUS shakes his head no.                Good.                No... I don't want to go.      LEE looks up at EVELYN.   Then back to MARCUS.                There's nothing to be scared of.                ...of course there is.     Suddenly behind LEE we see... REGAN appear.                I'll go.     LEE looks over at his daughter and pauses.                No, no. I need you to stay here               and help your mother.     LEE stands up. To EVELYN:                We'll be back before dinner.                I want to go.                Just stay here. You'll be safe.     LEE turns to EVELYN... who looks at him with slight     disappointment.                ... Next time.     LEE pauses... and then kisses EVELYN.   LEE and MARCUS walk     down a sand path toward the woods.     EVELYN turns to REGAN... who is already walking away.      REGAN enters... And throws the hearing aid her father made     her onto the dirt floor. This is the first time we have seen     her bedroom. It is sparse. A hay bale covered in bed     sheets... a small crate with a neat pile of books inside and     several candles on top... a small wooden mirror leant against     the wall.     REGAN drops to her knees. On the ground we now see all kinds     of electronic equipment and tools.      Architectural drawings are pinned to the wall.   It is like a     mini version of her father's work bench.     REGAN grabs her pillow, rips the pillow case off... and     begins furiously packing.     She grabs clothes, a water bottle, a notepad and then... THE     TOY SHUTTLE. She gets up to leave and then looks back... at     the hearing aid on the ground.     CLOSE ON REGAN's PROFILE as her hand comes into frame and     moves to the hearing aid she currently wears. Suddenly... a     long wire is slowly pulled from deep in her ear canal.     REGAN's eyes wince with almost a snap of pressure as the wire     comes loose.     REGAN then gently feeds the new hearing aid into her ear...     and pauses.     Suddenly... REGAN clicks on the new hearing aid.     ........................................Nothing.     WE WATCH the thin veil of anger on REGAN's face cascade into     honest sorrow as REGAN's eyes squeeze shut brutal     disappointment.     WE PULL OUT to see REGAN sitting quietly on the floor. The     quake of her shoulders betray her... as we watch her cry.     After a moment... she reaches for a pillow case... and exits.      FROM A DISTANCE LEE leads MARCUS down a thin sand path that     cuts down the steep valley side and through the lush and     learned evergreens of the mountain's canopy.     MARCUS walks rigid, like one would in the dark. His saucer     eyes furtively clock every detail of his surroundings. LEE     walks casually and confidently, periodically turning to wait     patiently for his son. This is a day of teaching.     ON MARCUS as LEE puts a hand quickly, but gently on his son's     chest, stopping him in his tracks. LEE focuses down the     path.     OFF MARCUS's quaking face peering around his father:     WE TOO MOVE around from behind LEE to see... a DEER...     sitting in the middle of the sand path. An adolescent buck,     it holds it's impressive, but still delicate antlers upright     and proud as it stares directly at LEE and MARCUS.      An image obviously long thought impossible, the moment     carries a certain calm... almost spiritual.     After a long moment, the buck efforts its way to its feet.     Then turns and deftly steps... perfectly along the sand     path... And disappears.      CLOSE ON the roof of the farmhouse. Water from the previous     night's storm still drips off the edge.     WE SLOWLY TRAVEL down the drainpipe running along the side of     the house when suddenly... the drain stops... and we see PVC     pipe has been attached instead. WE CONTINUE along the PVC     piping to the bottom where we see THE PVC PIPE bend... AND GO       FROM INSIDE THE SHATTERED PANE, we now follow the PVC pipe     into... an old washing machine... now filled with rain water.     Suddenly... a piece of clothing slowly comes into frame and     silently descends into the water.     WE WIDEN OUT TO SEE EVELYN places more clothes into a     WASHER... that is unplugged. We see that she is simply using     the corrugated tumbler inside as a wash board.     She removes a large plaid shirt just above the water line     (still inside the tumbler) and squeezes it dry. The action is     virtually inaudible.     CLOSE UP on a small pile of clothes being stacked onto other     clothes. Then a CINCH.     EVELYN stands up over the newly packed cloth laundry bag...     then bends backward, attempting to relieve a pain in her     back. When she's done, she picks up the full laundry bag     with one hand... and another full laundry bag with the other.     EVELYN struggles to the foot of the stairs with the two bags     and puts them down. She then takes a deep breath looks up     the stairwell and begins to ascend... again carefully placing     her feet on specific spots on each step. Holding one bag as     high as she can and dragging the second behind her... It's     uncomfortable watching a fully pregnant woman traverse in     this manner.     WE GO CLOSE ON several stairs as EVELYN'S feet step up... and     drag the bag up the first step... then the second.      Her feet disappear. As she drags the bag up onto the     third... IT CATCHES ON A BENT NAIL IN THE STAIR!!     ON EVELYN, not seeing the cause, pulls again... AND BEGINS TO      She catches herself on the wall, her eyes lit up... breathing     heavily... she's ok!     She quietly picks up the bags again and pulls once more.      ON EVELYN, satisfied, as she drags the bags to the top of the     stairs and disappears.     WE RACK FOCUS to reveal, in the foreground...       CLOSE ON BARE FEET... walking along a sand path.     WE BOOM UP TO REVEAL... REGAN walking with purpose. In her     hands she carries a pillowcase. Inside the pillowcase... an     irregular shape.     After a moment, she looks up to... the telephone pole.     Sitting on the power line are... MORE BIRDS. There is     something buoyant about them. Something... oblivious.      An immediate and jarring sound of water rushes in as we are:     TIGHT ON MOVING WATER over rocks.      WE TILT UP to the tall grass of a riverbed. Suddenly... LEE     and MARCUS exit from the trees.     ON MARCUS as he takes in the picturesque landscape. He has     never been here before. Suddenly, his eyes slowly move down     to the ground.     CLOSE ON HIS BARE FEET... at the very edge of the sand path.     There is nowhere else to go. MARCUS watches as LEE takes off his backpack and places it atthe edge of the river. Then, he kneels down and looksintently into the water. Suddenly... LEE's face softens. Hetakes one more look back at his son... and then plunges hishands into the river.MARCUS looks on confused as his father seems to yank and pullat something. Suddenly... LEE's hands burst out of the waterholding a handmade wooden contraption. MARCUS starts to backaway... Pulling that contraption out of the water DEFINITELYMADE A SOUND!!! MARCUS' eyes shoot around into the trees, upthe river, looking... listening... when suddenly...  MARCUS goes white! WHAT HAS HIS FATHER DONE????   MARCUSsigns...           They're going to hear you...          They're going to HEAR YOU!!In one swift move, LEE pins the trout to the ground and grabshis son, pulling him in close. LEE silently calms his sondown, coaxing him to take deep breaths. As MARCUS trembles...LEE raises his hand... and signs...           Not... if there is a constant sound          nearby that is louder.MARCUS doesn't understand. LEE shows him. First, he reachesdown to the ground and places his hand off the path movingthe dirt slightly. He repeats...           Small sounds... safe.LEE's hand moves back to the trout... Repeats           Big sounds... not. Unless...LEE's hands move to the moving water of the river... Repeats           There is a constant sound nearby          that is louder... To mask it.      Suddenly the trout flaps again. MARCUS looks down... then up     to his dad... His brain processing.                You know what?...     LEE checks his watch... then looks up river... then back to     his son.                ...I want to show you something.      Disoriented, WE MOVE THROUGH a wall of dancing color.   Then     suddenly we see... EVELYN, as she holds up a piece of     clothing and pins it to a clothes line. The scene is     oddly... beautiful.     As the clothes on the line dance, we can suddenly see, behind       WE TRACK SLOWLY along through the bannister of the upstairs     hallway when suddenly... EVELYN'S head appears. WE CONTINUE     with her as she slowly walks up the stairs... almost as if     compelled. As she ascends, looking right past camera, we get     a clear look into the bedrooms behind her. In one room, we     catch glimpses of a POP MUSIC POSTER, a PINK DESK... and an     empty bed frame. In the next, we see a Nerf basketball hoop,     a life sized Pokemon doll... and half built LEGOs strewn     across the floor. ...Neither room has doors.     EVELYN finally crests the top of the stairs and walks out of     frame.      A bizarre and beautiful image and sound! Light dances and     bends through a cascading rampart we finally identify as... A      WE PAN OVER to see LEE and MARCUS enter from outside and     slide along the rock wall.     MARCUS looks up to his father, incredulous. LEE looks down     at him. After a moment, with a mischievous smile on his face,        MARCUS' eyes shoot up to his father, immediately scared     again!     His father looks out at the waterfall... and HOOTS     AGAIN!!!... The way one would walking in a tunnel with their     child.     LEE turns to MARCUS and crouches down, gently holding his     trembling son's shoulders.                ... You're alright.      WE ARE ON MARCUS' face... staring... shaking... somewhere     between terror and wonderment.                ... I promise.     His father smiles and nods comfortingly...     Finally MARCUS... meekly HOOTS!     His father's head gently tilts, as if to say ""you can do     better"".     MARCUS looks back out the rushing water, then back to his     father... and HOOTS LOUDLY!!!                Now... that's more like it.     The smile on MARCUS and LEE's face can only be described     as... once in a lifetime.      WE MOVE SLOWLY ALONG A ROAD, PANNING DOWN from gargantuan     trees... until we finally reveal... REGAN walking towards     camera.     Suddenly coming into frame all around her is... THE BRIDGE.      WE FOLLOW REGAN as she walks across the bridge, now more     overgrown with weeds and roots. Then suddenly... REGAN comes     to a stop... and kneels down in sand as:     WE CONTINUE TO MOVE BACK SLOWLY.   Suddenly coming into frame     is the top of....      REGAN reaches into her pillow case and pulls out... THE TOY      WE FOLLOW REGAN'S HANDS as she deftly removes one of the     colored plastic pieces underneath. It quietly slides off to     reveal... a battery panel and several multicolored wires. She     reaches into the front pocket of her dress and pulls out     pliers and quickly cuts the green wire.     REGAN reaches into the pocket of her dress again and pulls     out... batteries! She slides the batteries in confidently.     We follow REGAN's hands as they move to the base of the cross     and place... the TOY SHUTTLE in the sand. We now see that     the shuttle sits amongst a pile of other weathered toys...     and flowers.     REGAN PAUSES.................and then flips the tiny switch.      ...But no sound.      WE ARE TIGHT on EVELYN's back as she walks through another     door-less threshold. As she continues into the room, we begin     to see the walls... covered in rocket ships.     OVER EVELYN as her eyes stop... on a cartoon mobile of the     planets. She taps it... exactly as she tapped the mobile in     the baby's room... This time watching it orbit around...     without a smile.     WIDE ON THE ROOM for the first time we see... THE ROOM IS     METICULOUS. The bed is made... the toys perfectly placed on     the shelves.     CLOSE ON THE BED... AS EVELYN SITS DOWN SLOWLY. Light floods     through the original paned window... casting the shadow of a     cross on the floor in front of her.     EVELYN looks over to the small night stand by the bed where a     lamp and a hand made mirror sit.      Suddenly, she lifts up the mirror... and dusts the table with     the washcloth from the line.     EVELYN stares out the window oddly... at peace. As LEE has     his ritual atop the silo to contemplate on the irreversible     loss of his son... EVELYN has this. EVELYN... keeps her     son's spirit alive.      CLOSE ON a water bladder poking into the rushing wall of     water. Filling immediately, we:     PULL BACK and FOLLOW LEE... as he sits down on a rock next to     his son and hands him the bladder. MARCUS drinks as LEE     looks on... a brightness washing over him. This is a moment     of... calm. A moment... of family. A moment... of real     life.     WE FOLLOW the bladder as MARCUS hands it up to his father,     who happily takes a large swig. Suddenly we HEAR:                Why didn't you let her come with               us?     LEE looks down at his son.                Because... I need to keep her safe.                ... Is it because you blame her for               what happened?     LEE freezes instantly... his heart stops.     Finally he looks down at his son... in shock? In awe?                Because she blames herself...     LEE's eyes blink and flutter as he tries to gain control of     his thoughts...                No, I don't bl--... It was no one's               fault.                ... You still love her, right?                 Of-- Of course I do.     Pause.                ... You should tell her.      CLOSE ON EVELYN IN THE HAND MADE MIRROR, as she stares at the     frame... made up of colorful zoo animals staring back at her.     At the top of the mirror, the name... ""BEAU""     FROM THE DOORWAY, WE ARE WIDE ON THE ROOM as EVELYN stands up     and slowly makes her way to the door carrying the small     mirror.     Just as she reaches the doorway... she stops. Her body     tightens. Her face... changes. Her hand shakes as it     reaches out to the side of the doorway. WE HOLD ON HER a     moment and then go:     CLOSE ON her feet rocking slightly in the doorway.     Suddenly......       LEE and MARCUS appear through an oddly beautiful exit from     the woods and begin walking along a path.     PROFILE on LEE as we see the tall thin trees of a swamp     behind him.     PROFILE ON MARCUS from the opposite side as swamp trees are     also behind him. Suddenly... A DILAPIDATED house comes into     frame. MARCUS turns to look.     MARCUS' POV of the eery house...that stands as a reminder     that people once lived here happily.     CLOSE ON MARCUS looking up on the house. His face... now     fearful. Suddenly, behind MARCUS, just out of focus in the     short distance...      No sooner has the FIGURE exited frame, MARCUS... CRASHES INTO MARCUS looks up at his father... who stares off sharply intothe short distance...OVER MARCUS as he slowly leans around his father to see whathe's looking at, when suddenly we see... A human form unlike anything most of us ever will... orshould get to see, the man's emaciated body quakes and thenshudders as if a synapses misfire. His face is sunken...almost ghoulish and the look in his pitch black eyescommunicates something far beyond fearful. Much worse, thisis the rare look of a brain that has accepted a livingnightmare... as an everyday reality.ON MARCUS as he slowly raises his hand... into a wave.ON THE MAN... who doesn't move.ON LEE as his eyes travel slowly down the man's frame.ON LEE'S PERSPECTIVE as we see the man's dirt covered face,then a ratty and ripped flannel shirt, and then... bloodcovered hands... blood covered jeans... and finally at hisfeet, in the high grass... ON LEE as his eyes slowly come back up to meet the man's.LEE now also raises his hand... and places a tense finger onhis lips.ON THE MAN... as two large tears run down his face. In hiseyes... the knowing fear of the end of his life as... hetakes a deep breath in.LEE immediately grabs MARCUS.TIGHT ON LEE sprinting down the path carrying his son.    OVERHIS SHOULDER, the man in the background: ... A bottomless sound of pain and surrender, the soundblasts onto us like a wave.LEE suddenly dives behind a hallowed out tree trunk andthrows MARCUS' back up against it.ON MARCUS as his father clasps his hand over his mouth.MARCUS' eyes widen as overwhelming panic takes over.      ON LEE as he looks down at his son... with the most beautiful     sense of calm. The way one holds the hand of someone in their     last seconds on earth, LEE's smile is pure comfort... pure     love.     Suddenly we hear... THE FAMILIAR TERRIFYING SCREEEEEEEECH!     ON MARCUS... who begins violently shaking his head... his     soul seemingly coming out through his skin. Then suddenly we     hear... THE SNAPPING OF TREES!     ON LEE as his look now shoots to the tree line behind the man     when suddenly...     WE HEAR the man's primal scream of pain turn into... an     animal sound of death.     BACK ON MARCUS as he covers his ears. Through the muffle of     MARCUS' covered ears we can still hear... The most horrific     sounds of ultimate pain... crunching... and then...      A deafening      MARCUS' eyes almost seem to dim right before us...     As he goes limp.      FROM THE FLOOR we follow drops of fluid down the hall,     leading to... EVELYN gripping onto the railing with both     hands as she slowly traverses the stairs going down, focusing     intently on each step.     ON EVELYN's face as she takes slow, deep breaths.    Her eyes     surging with panic... and pain.      Suddenly... EVELYN's eyes go wide.      CLOSE ON EVELYN'S BELLY as she slowly sinks down into the     steps and INTO A CLOSE UP.     In EVELYN's face we will witness, many of us for the first     time, the complex and overwhelming sensory overload that is a     contraction... all swallowed back with every fiber of her     being in order to remain.... Silent.      Just at the moment it looks as though EVELYN may explode...     the contraction subsides.     WE ARE ON EVELYN's BACK as she struggles up onto her feet and     down the remaining stairs. As she rounds the banister and out     of frame... WE HOLD ON THE FRONT HALL.     Out the front door and onto the sand path warmly lit white     from the Christmas lights above.      WE ARE LOW looking up the basement stairs as suddenly...     EVELYN appears in the narrow doorway and grabs hold of the     wall, still carrying the children's mirror. She takes a     moment and then begins to descend the exposed stairs with the     same deliberate effort.     COMING TOWARDS CAMERA, EVELYN gets bigger and bigger in the     frame until her head disappears, then her belly.     Just as her foot comes down into close up we:     RACK FOCUS to... THE NAIL STANDING STRAIGHT UP!!!!     EVELYN's foot steps STRAIGHT DOWN ON IT!!!!!     WE WATCH THE NAIL PIERCE INTO THE BOTTOM OF HER FOOT... and     then ERUPT THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE!!!!!!!!     THE SOUND CUTS OUT as we go:     CLOSE ON EVELYN as the shock and searing pain collides in her     brain behind her eyes. Then...     CLOSE ON THE MIRROR as it SILENTLY CRASHES DOWN THE STAIRS...     then rattles around in a circle before coming to a     standstill.      ON EVELYN as full blown fear washes over her. That sound was     most definitely HEARD. She looks down...     CLOSE ON EVELYN's FOOT... as she SLIDES THE FOOT SLOWLY UP     THE NAIL... and POPS IT FREE. Blood immediately begins to     drip from the wound.     EVELYN rushes down the remaining stairs, wincing with every     other step.      WE FOLLOW ON EVELYN's BACK as she hurriedly shuffles through     this basement that once felt familiar in the romantic glow of     their slow dance... but now feels stark... and desperately     lonely.     Finally, EVELYN arrives... at LEE's security console. She     desperately pushes past stacks of notebooks and files, boxes     of various electrical equipment like cellphones, cassette     players and EGG TIMERS that have been pillaged for parts.     EVELYN finally moves... THE BOX OF HEARING AIDS... to reveal     that there on the wall... is a large, hand made switch.     EVELYN grabs the knob at the top and thrusts it down.      Suddenly, flickering to life against the dusk colored sky...      Like the white lights before, the power grid like system     illuminates the farm in bright... RED!!!      REGAN lies in the sand next to the cross.    Behind her we     see... RED LIGHTS THROUGH THE TREES!     ... REGAN doesn't see them.      ON EVELYN, leaning on LEE's console. Her eyes closed, she     takes slow, deep breathes, as if to convince herself that it     will all be OK now... The signal has been sent.     For a brief moment... a smile... as she then opens her eyes     and moves back to the stairs.     As she clutches the support beam and goes to take her first     step up...      EVELYN spins back away from the stairs in terror.      As sky begins to settle into dusk above the towering trees...     LEE enters carrying a limp MARCUS.      He trudges up the sand path, looking down at MARCUS.     MARCUS' eyes are open... but he is not present.     ON LEE'S BACK NOW, as he and his son crest the hill.     WE BOOM UP to see the dark horizon line of sky... give way to     the top of the silo... and then the fire red ground     illuminated by Christmas lights.     ON LEE as we see his face register exactly what this means.     He breaks into a full sprint.      CLOSE ON one of the basement windows as red light pours     through.     WE PULL BACK SLOWLY as:     EVELYN's HANDS enter frame. She desperately pushes on the     window... nothing.     EVELYN roams around the basement like a caged animal     searching for any way out...     She moves back to LEE's security console, scanning the     desk... think... THINK!     Suddenly her eyes fall upon... the box of small electronics     she just moved to get to the switch.     Suddenly we hear:      EVELYN freezes with fear.   Then....      EVELYN closes her eyes as the same sound that preempted her     son's death washes over her.     Then... her eyes shoot open in pain...      Larger than the second one, this one brings EVELYN to her     knees, her head dips to the ground as she grimaces in intense     pain.      CLOSE ON EVELYN as her head suddenly shoots back up... The     red light pouring in from the basement windows cuts a line     across her face revealing her exploding eyes trying to     swallow the pain. Tears begin to fall... she is unable to     breath.     Then suddenly... air slowly escapes as she exhales... the     contraction has passed. After a moment of realization?...     Disbelief? She stands up and out of frame.     WE HOLD and then slowly pan down to... a small pool of blood     on the floor.      NOW LOOKING DOWN THE STAIRS from the doorway in the first     floor hallway... we see...     EVELYN rush through frame past the stairs.       ON EVELYN as she quickly slides in behind a large boiler. We     can see the basement stairs in the background.     EVELYN squeezes her eyes shut... and begins murmuring to     herself... THE NONDESCRIPT SOUND IS SLIGHTLY LOUDER... A      And then....     EVELYN's eyes shoot open... What now?   Suddenly....      We are on EVELYN'S face as she endures this immeasurable pain     in this unthinkable moment...     Then we hear...      Whatever IT is... it's coming DOWN THE STAIRS.      EVELYN crushes herself even tighter against the wall behind     the boiler... closing her eyes and exhaling in pure, painful,     silence as the contraction subsides... Suddenly we hear... EVELYN turns and peers through the water tanks.IN EVELYN'S POV as she scans the room through the sliver of aview then suddenly...We can barely make out more than a SLIVER of a creature'sshoulder or back from in between the tanks. WE CAN SEE THATIT IS COVERED IN SMALL ARMOR LIKE PLATES! Suddenly...The small plates on the creature's shoulder... BEGIN TO LIFTUP??!! Like the pieces on a colander, or... an old satellitedish... the small plates open up with the crackle and pull ofanatomical goo underneath. Then all of the sudden... theplates BEGIN TO ROTATE! Like directional microphones, theplates... begin searching the room... FOR SOUND!From behind the tanks, EVELYN watches as the creature'splates turn toward the wall of monitors. Suddenly, each ofthe screens... begins to flicker!!! Then... the picture goescompletely dark!EVELYN then suddenly rolls her back against the tanks to lookfrom one side of the room... to the other.Suddenly... We now can identify the NONDESCRIPT SOUND FROMEARLIER as... TICKING.....Then, sitting on a shelf on the wall opposite the console, wesee...  when finally, just as we land CLOSE UP on the egg timer...   EVELYN opens her eyes...That's it! Her plan worked!    EVELYN thrusts herself awayfrom the tanks!!WE TRACK WITH HER as she moves as quickly as she can to theexposed stairs and begins to climb.        DOOR. Suddenly... EVELYN bursts out of the doorway from the     basement.     WE FOLLOW ON HER BACK as she maneuvers her feet desperately     from PAINTED SPOT to PAINTED SPOT down the hall to the front     door and to freedom!     She grabs the stair post for support as she crosses through     the front hall, only steps from the door when, OVER HER     SHOULDER we barely see:      EVELYN immediately spins around into CLOSE UP as we now LEAD     HER as she rushes up the main stairs.     At the top of the stairs, WE TILT DOWN as she reaches to the     floor and picks up the thick blankets covering the landing.     Behind her... THE FRONT HALL LIGHTS BEGIN TO BRIGHTEN!      WE HOLD ON the side of the barn... as LEE enters with MARCUS     and places him on the ground.     WE FOLLOW LEE as he slowly cranes his neck to look around the     barn. There, beautifully lit in RED is the sand path leading     to the farmhouse. LEE's eyes travel down the path and up the     stairs and...      LEE snaps his back against the wall, his eyes darting with     fear as he thinks... thinks. Finally he turns to his son who     stands looking at him blankly.     LEE immediately digs into his back pack and pulls out... A      LEE places the flashlight in MARCUS's hands.   MARCUS looks up     to him with familiar panic in his eyes.     LEE then slides closer to his son... and gently places his     hands on MARCUS' shoulders.     Suddenly, LEE places his left hand straight up against his     chest, crosses the fingers of his right hand, brings the two     together and... shoots his right hand into the sky.      This... is the same exact sign his four year old son made in     the general store at the beginning of the movie. This...     means ROCKET.     MARCUS shakes his head no.     LEE gently places his hands on MARCUS' face and looks     directly in his eyes. No doubt informed by the heart opening     day they've had... It is a beautiful moment of strength as     LEE communicates so much to his son. First and foremost,     there is understanding... and even an apology for the     situation they are in. But then the look turns to imploring.                Your mother needs help. I need you               to do this... for her.     MARCUS looks to his dad... his eyes change.                ... please...     And with that... MARCUS is gone.     ON LEE as he watches his son run down the side of the barn...     and disappear around the corner. He takes a deep breath...     God protect his son. God protect all of them.     LEE turns and runs around the barn.      FROM ABOVE we see EVELYN enter the room carrying the thick     blankets from the stairs and turns on the bathroom light...     spots of blood smear on the floor.     ON EVELYN as she slowly gets into the bathtub. Tears fall     down her face as she reaches over the wall of the tub... and     starts stacking the blankets from her knees to her chest.     As she folds the last blanket over herself...      This time her eyes go wide with the electric shock like pain.     This... is the big one. THIS... IS HAPPENING!     Suddenly we hear...TICK.... SCRAAAAAPE... TICK.... SCRAAAAAPE     Whatever IT is... it's trying to climb the stairs.     TIGHT ON EVELYN's hand as it jerks and grips til it turns     white from force.      FROM ABOVE, we see EVELYN in extreme pain... but somehow     keeping it all in.     Suddenly... a small stream of blood begins to trickle by her     exposed feet.      LEE rushes into his room and reaches under his mattress and     pulls out...     A SHOT GUN!... Not the first choice, when trying not to make     noise... but he has no other choice.      MARCUS walks down a thin sand path, suddenly stops... and     looks up to a HUGE OVERARCHING FIGURE ABOVE HIM!     It is a watering device found in cornfields that tower high     above the corn and roll slowly through the fields on giant     wheels.      ON THE BATHTUB. All that can be seen are EVELYN's eyes as     she peers over the bathtub wall. Through the door... and to     the steps. Suddenly we hear again...      Just then... The light bulb above EVELYN begins to DIM!!!     QUICKLY BACK ON EVELYN as she begins to cry, preparing for     the end. And then...      FROM ABOVE as EVELYN's face shoots to the sky... with no     affect. Her eyes wide, the rest of her face is calm.     Then we see... Blood and fluid now pool around her feet as     the light above her... goes out.     From only the light from the window we see EVELYN's face...     finally crack in pain. Her mouth opens... releasing the most     guttural... and now two person...      BUT, right at that moment, the screams of mother and baby are     drowned out by a thundering.....       WE TRACK WITH LEE as he sprints down the sand path holding     the shot gun like a civil war soldier rushing into battle     as...      Red, green, white... large plumes, small sparkles falling     down.     In the midst of this unthinkable nightmare... it's gorgeous.      Huge bursts of fireworks light up through the tops of the     towering trees...     REGAN, sits up abruptly into the fireworks' silhouette.     CLOSE ON REGAN as the colors illuminate on her face.      FROM THE DINING ROOM, we look into the front hall in the     background.     Suddenly, from the doorway... the muzzle of a gun pokes     through. Then moments later... LEE walks in stealthily.     Moving the gun exactly where his eyes point... he clears the     room.     ON LEE'S BACK as we look down the gun barrel. He looks to     the dining room. He looks to the living room. He looks to     the... STAIRS!!!     LEE'S POV as he walks up the stairs. On each stair... drops     of blood. To the left, along the wall, the wallpaper has been     intermittently RIPPED... IN THREE EQUIDISTANT MEANDERING       THROUGH A DOORWAY onto the now exposed wood floor landing     with the bannister outlining the upstairs hall.     Suddenly, the top of LEE's head enters frame... just as the     creature's had only moments before... Then his gun, facing     into the bedrooms to the side. LEE moves the gun confidently     in all directions, making sure the upstairs is clear.     As LEE's gaze comes around to face directly at us... his gun     lowers... and:     WE SLOWLY PULL BACK INTO THE ROOM TO REVEAL... the     bloodstained edge... of the BATH TUB.     ON LEE's BACK as he rushes to the tub to find... just blood     in an empty bath tub.     LEE turns into his own CLOSE UP PROFILE as his back slides     down the bathtub and onto the floor. His hand releases the     gun to the floor. His eyes close and he begins to... softly     weep.     A mirror behind LEE reflects the room back to him, revealing     for the first time... a beveled glass shower door at the     opposite end of the room. Suddenly...     A BLOODY HAND HITS THE GLASS!!!!... And the shower door     slowly opens!!!     OVER LEE as he scrambles to the shower and opens the door!     Stuffed inside... is a quivering pile of blankets.     LEE drops to his knees and pulls back the blankets to see...     his wife. Pale, with eyes closed... she's breathing. And in     her arms... a sleeping newborn baby.      WE HOLD ON THE TOPS OF THE DENSE CORN, the creature like     silhouette of the giant watering device looming... as the     last of a series of bottle rockets fire into the darkening     night sky.     WE MOVE ABOVE THE CORN and then descend through it onto a     thin sand path and onto... MARCUS. WE FOLLOW WITH HIM as he     safely walks back toward the BARN, holding his flashlight, as     the final bursts of fireworks illuminate behind him. On     MARCUS' face... is genuine pride. He knows he has done     something heroic. Suddenly... MARCUS, frantically whips his light around the path behindhim.WE FOLLOW HIS LIGHT as it scans the path and the stalks...Even with nothing there... it's terrifying.Just then... His flashlight begins to DIM.... MARCUS whips his light around to the thin sand path in FRONTof him... nothing...SNAP!!! CRUNCH!!! SNAP!!! CRUNCH!!!   Something ELSE ismoving toward him... fast!MARCUS turns around, away from the BARN... AND RUNS!!!!   WEARE ON MARCUS' FACE AS HE RUNS... Scanning, scanning...   MARCUS turns and begins to run... INTO THE CORN!!!! CROSSES RIGHT PAST LENS. THE FLASHLIGHT not able to castlight on anything that's not right in our face, creatingalmost a STROBE EFFECT!!! MARCUS is making... A TON OF ON MARCUS' FACE... pure panic. When suddenly... WE ARRIVEinto a small clearing to see... A TRACTOR, completelyovergrown with corn. MARCUS immediately climbs onto thetractor and frantically whips his light around theclearing... and into the dense corn... CRUNCH!!! Something is moving toward him FAST! THE LIGHTBEGINS TO FLICKER.... and then goes out.Suddenly, off in the corn in front of him (AND FOR THE FIRSTTIME) we hear... A LOUD SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH!!!! The lightsuddenly BLARES BRIGHT as... ALL IN AN INSTANT, MARCUS flies back in fear! Slipping fromthe top of the tractor... and SLAMMING HIS HEAD INTO THE        Fade in: The night is now dark.     WE ARE BEHIND REGAN walking.   AS WE ARE WITH HER... WE ARE IN      She looks around at the remnants of the last horrifying     moments... More reminiscent of a soldier returning to a     battlefield, then a girl returning to a farm, we see     countless streamers of firework smoke still falling     gracefully from the sky. The tips of dry cornstalks     flicker... alight with small flames. Off in the distance we     see... lights of the SILO. Shining like a beacon.     REGAN walks along the eerie shadows of corn stalks when     suddenly at her feet... cracks of light.     REGAN lowers to her knees and puts her head to the ground to     see... a bright light, cutting through the bottom of the     stalks of corn. Suddenly, the pliers REGAN used to work on     the TOY SHUTTLE... slip out of the pocket of her dress...      REGAN... doesn't even notice... because she didn't even hear     it... REGAN sits back up to kneeling position when suddenly     the cornstalks behind her... BEGIN TO LAY DOWN... AS A SHADOW     EMERGES!!!At that exact moment... we begin to hear the oddest     and unpleasent beeeeeeeeeeeep.     Suddenly, REGAN's eyes begin to squint slightly.   Then... her     hand slowly reaches up to her ear?...      SUDDENLY... the SHADOW moves closer to REGAN... and THE     BEEEEEEP GROWS!!! Now at a near deafening level, we see the     shadow behind REGAN... stop? REGAN's face now scrunches up     in agony as she grabs her ears!!! REGAN digs into her right     ear, rips out the hearing aid and launches forward!!      REGAN suddenly kneels back up into frame... THE SHADOW IS      Breathing wildly, REGAN looks at the hearing aid in her hand.     Her face is almost electrified! As excruciating as that     was.... THAT IS THE FIRST SOUND SHE HAS EVER HEARD!     REGAN... slowly puts the hearing aid back in her ear...     ....nothing....       WE FOLLOW REGAN as she walks down the small path leading     to... the clearing. One ladder stands, the other ladder on     the ground, bottles and fireworks litter the ground. And     then, there in the center of the clearing, lit by the     flashlight... one half of a deer carcass.     ... No sign of MARCUS...     REGAN slowly bends down to pick up the flashlight when     suddenly... THE CARCASS MOVES! REGAN jumps back,     terrified!!!     Then from under the neck of the deer... a hand!!     REGAN runs over and pushes the carcass off of... MARCUS, who     has been safely lying underneath.     Covered in blood, he scrambles to try to get to his feet.     REGAN grabs him and holds him tight. She places her finger     to her lips... just like her dad.     She looks around to see if they have a chance to run... and     then thinks better of it. She looks back to her brother...     and places her hand on his chest.     WE RISE above the clearing, above the overgrown tractor...     and once again into the night.      WE ARE WIDE on the FARMHOUSE. The RED CHRISTMAS lights sway     gently in the now calm night air.     After a long quiet moment...     LEE appears at the doorway.    He carries EVELYN in his arms...     The baby in hers.     He slowly descends the porch stairs and begins to walk toward     the BARN... his eyes locked firmly on his cargo. For a     moment, as LEE walks, this all feels almost like a dream. Or     the end of a nightmare. Respite.     WE ARE TIGHT ON EVELYN who we see is unconscious from the     trauma and the loss of fluids... THEN DOWN TO the tightly     wrapped baby sleeping in her arms.     LEE looks ahead to the doors of the BARN off in the seemingly     never ending distance.     Suddenly...  LEE's eyes shoot down to see the baby streeeeeeeeetch... andslowly begin to open it's eyes.ON THE BABY as it looks up, searchingly, at his father... ashis father picks up his pace!Suddenly... we begin to notice the dim red light on thebaby's face... BEGINS TO FLICKER!ON THE BARN DOORS getting closer... closer.ON LEE as he trudges with everything he has to get his babyto safety when suddenly... a cold wind blows across LEE'sface and through his hair.LEE slowly looks down as... WE HOLD DIRECTLY ON LEE, LEADING HIM, as he breaks into afull sprint!LEE'S eyes momentarily dart quickly to the side, not at allprepared for what he might find.WE NEVER LEAVE LEE's FACE. As his head bobs back and forthfrom running, we intermittently catch glimpses of the longpath behind him. First we see the FARMHOUSE shrinking in thedistance behind him. And then we hear... BEHIND LEE... the large tree near the farmhouse moveswildly!!LEE's eyes never even widen. There is no surprise. This isthe moment he knew would come. As he sprints with everythinghe has... the string of bulbs above him... DIM DOWN TO ALMOST  Lee... Is... Running... running... closer... closer...then.... WE ARE ON LEE as he sprints through the familiar interior ofthe BARN. When suddenly...WE HEAR A HUGE BANG!!!   Then...        LEE falls back onto the steps, barely holding onto his wife     and child as his free hand reaches for... the mattress!     As LEE finally grabs the mattress and slides it over the     opening above the stairwell...      In total darkness we hear:       OF SCRATCHING, TEARING AND SCREECHING... Then...     FIRE!!... LEE's lighter cuts through the black and then     retreats into a small glow in the room as we try to     comprehend what's happening. We see EVELYN has been placed     on a hay bale as...      LEE picks up the crying baby... as we PUSH IN. For one brief     second amidst the fury of nerves and sound we see... a father     holding his newborn child for the first time. It is a     precious, once in a lifetime moment.     Then...     A PLASTIC MASK COMES INTO FRAME... and ONTO THE BABY's      As if in an airplane video, LEE wraps the mask's strap behind     the baby's head... and then LOWERS THE BABY INTO THE WOODEN,      WE PAN TO THE SIDE of the box... along a clear plastic     tube... to a stand up air canister. LEE's hand enters frame     and turns the valve... a quiet whisper of air.     LEE stares down at his tiny crying baby wearing an oxygen     mask. The juxtaposed image seemingly almost as bizarre to     him as it is to us. THEN...         LEE just stares down at the small casket like box...     This either works... or they're dead...      WE FOLLOW REGAN and MARCUS as they sprint up the main sand     path/driveway running parallel to the cornfields. With the     flashlight slicing through the darkness... it's nearly     impossible to tell where we are. Suddenly the corn ends and     OVER MARCUS AND REGAN we see...     Shadows of farm equipment!     REGAN turns her head... and looks up.     REGAN's POV as we climb higher and higher... to the top of     the SILO!      Silence... The frame filled with a dark brown... Time has     passed. Then...     WE TRAVEL DOWN from the dirt ceiling... past a hook on the     wooden support beam... to a clear plastic IV BAG hanging...     down a fluid filled plastic tube... and into an arm.     WE PULL BACK to reveal EVELYN lying on the hay bale     comfortably... her eyes still closed. She has been     bandaged... and wears LEE's sweater. A single burning candle     by her side. Then...      Out of the darkness... comes LEE!   He is holding the baby.                It's ok.   It's ok!   Your safe.     EVELYN looks up at LEE immediately confused as to why he's     talking... then it sinks in.            It worked?           It worked.           It worked... it worked...LEE holds up the sleeping baby and places it in EVELYN'sarms... Tears fall down her face. She looks back up to herhusband... and then around the room.           Where's Marcus?Pause.           I'll find them.           Them?!EVELYN immediately tenses.LEE takes the sleeping baby from EVELYN and places it in thesafe wooden box. No air mask needed now.           She was with me in the house. I          was doing laundry and she-- He was          with you. How did he--LEE sits next to his wife... and begins to lay her back down.           Rockets.EVELYN pauses.           Then he-- then he's still there.          He'd know to--LEE sits next to his wife... and begins to lay her back down.           I'm sure he is.           She's smart she'll have found a          place to-- She's smart... EVELYN's gaze finally lands on her child.           It's a boy.           ... It's a boy.           ... It's a boy.Pause.           ... I could have carried him.LEE looks at his wife confused.           He was so heavy...LEE freezes...           I can still feel the weight in my          arms. He was... small, but so          heavy, wasn't he?LEE can't speak.           My hands were free-- I was carrying          the bag, but my hands were still          free... I could have carried him...          I should have carried him.           ...Evelyn...           Who are we?... if we can't protect          them. Who are we?LEE is frozen... every image rushing back to him.           You have to protect them.           I will.                 Promise me. We can't--... You need               to protect them.       As it dies down, coming into view we see... MARCUS sitting in     front of the shallow metal drum their father sat in front of     the night before.     REGAN walks around the fire looking out across the farm for     any sign of her father.     Just as the fire is about to die out, REGAN walks back and     squirts the last remaining fluid from the bottle. The fire     rages again and illuminates the two children... as well as     the fading hope on their faces.     The fire begins to die down again. REGAN rummages in the box     picking up the empty bottles of lighter fluid and shaking     them frantically...     She shakes the last empty bottle... And slumps down...     defeated... scared.     In the last moments of the dying flame...                He'll come for us.     The two kids stare off desperately over the farm...     preventing them from seeing far off in the distance to the     right...     A fire ignites... Then farther off... another fire...      The kids don't even notice.      WE ARE ON THE FAMILIAR image of the interior of the BARN.     Suddenly, the mattress on the ground... moves.   Then...     LEE's head slowly arises from underground.     LEE stands to see their barn... their life has been tossed     and ravaged.      LEE places the mattress back over the large unfinished hole     leading down to the safe room and stands up. LEE stares down     at the mattress... and what it protects... then walks out of     frame.     WE HOLD ON THE mattress a moment... And then SLOWLY MOVE     along the floor of the BARN... past the monopoly game...     until we reach the bedroom stalls to see...      As we move down we see... a pipe above the long trough on the     wall...has broken...       CLOSE ON REGAN, oddly lit. She lays on her back staring up...     at the stars. REGAN fumbles with something in her ear...     WE GO EXTREME CLOSE on her turning the tiny dial on top of     her hearing aid. As she does... she places her other hand by     her ear and rubs her fingers together, hoping to hear a     sound.... Nothing.     REGAN turns the dial even more... nothing.     REGAN immediately rolls over, frustrated. Sitting directly     in her view, on his dad's small stool... is MARCUS looking     out hopefully to the farm.                He'll come.     REGAN scoffs and goes to get up when suddenly, under her     dad's stool she sees... a box... the box LEE kept the photo     in... She reaches under the stool and grabs it.     NOW CLOSE OVER THE BOX ONTO REGAN as she stares down at it...     Then... As the lid opens, it covers frame completely to...       EVELYN'S eyes shoot open!   Her face barely lit from a small     slice of red light.     We hear very clearly... The sound of running water. EVELYN squints as her eyes adjust to the low light andattempts to get her bearings.EVELYN's POV as she scans across the ceiling, down the wallsand finally onto... the blanket covered crib in the middle ofthe room.A relieved smile appears on EVELYN's face... and then awince... as she slowly tries to sit up.She quietly slides her legs off of the hay bale and towardthe ground when... she suddenly stops!WE FOLLOW EVELYN's eyes down her body to the ground to seeher legs... EVELYN's eyes shoot frantically around the dark room againand finally land on the source of red light from above. Sheleans forward to see... CHRISTMAS LIGHTS... From one corner of the large opening... a stream of waterpours down into the room. Suddenly... EVELYN's head slowly turns... The look on her face reveals tous the immediate truth that her brain won't yet admit.EVELYN's POV as we scan the room once more.   This time, inthe shadowed corner of the room... EVELYN is frozen with fear as she watches.... EVELYN'S eyes travel down from the creature... to her baby'scrib where... Suddenly... WE HEAR THE BEGINNINGS OF THE LOW HUM!!!We see a flash of red reflected off the small plates... asthey open. WE HOLD ON EVELYN, her brain racing as fast as her heart, asshe slowly looks at THE PLATES ROTATING... SCANNING THE ROOM.Suddenly... Her breath stops... as EVELYN... As she stands... We watch the rings in the water from EVELYNflow through the room... TO THE CREATURE!! The platesimmediately turn down toward the rings in the water.EVELYN looks over to the water running down the steps... thenback to the creature. It is clear it can't place exactlywhere she is due to the sound of the dripping water.WE FOLLOW on EVELYN'S back as she begins to slowly... MOVE Suddenly... the red lights from the barn above begin toDIM... and illuminate THE CREATURES BACK!!!WE GO CLOSE on it's small plates completely opened up andvibrating... WE TRAVEL CLOSE up it's back through the tunnelof receiving its plates have created and end CLOSE ON thecavernous holes in it's head where the information isprocessed.When suddenly... EVELYN, with an unnerving calm... CLOSE ON the crib to reveal... CLOSE ON EVELYN, as she places the baby on her shoulder as... EVELYN'S POV as we watch... THE CREATURE's plates begin toturn on its body... they are turning... TOWARD EVELYN...THE WATER BEGINS TO MOVE as... THE CREATURE TURNS TO EVELYN!! UP ON EVELYN as she closes her eyes and continues walkingbackward, when suddenly we see... A GUSH OF WATER CASCADING Without flinching, EVELYN COVERS THE BABY... AND WALKS RIGHTTHROUGH THE CASCADING WATER suddenly... DISAPPEARING!ON EVELYN, her back pressed up against the dirt wall. Thewater pouring only inches from her face... like a smallwaterfall.      Then just in front of EVELYN... distorted behind the     waterfall... THE CREATURE SLOWLY ENTERS... then...     Though our view is skewed through the water... IT OPENS IT'S     MOUTH!!! Even through the distortion, we still understand     what we're seeing is A LONG CRESCENT OF RAZOR SHARP TEETH!!!!      From black... a flashlight slices into frame, illuminating     the looming corn stalks on either side as WE MOVE SLOWLY     along a thin sand path that cuts through the dense corn.     LEE walks into frame.     He comes to the end of the thin path and arrives at... THE      ON LEE'S face as he scans the area with his flashlight.     ON POV of flashlight as it floods the tractor with light.     LEE moves around the tractor... then stops.     POV of flashlight... BLOOD!!      The lid of the box closes to reveal REGAN.    The sadness that     has overtaken her... blends into anger.                We can't stay here. We need to               move.     MARCUS shakes his head.                He'll come for us.     REGAN shoots a look at him... and then walks AROUND THE EDGE     OF THE SILO to the ladder. MARCUS begins waving his arms     wildly. As REGAN turns to mount the first rung of the     ladder... she looks back at him.                He WILL come for us.     REGAN's sadness turns to anger.                He'll come for YOU!      MARCUS shakes his head, signing as he steps toward her.                No.   You're wrong! I--     And in the blink of an eye......      ON REGAN'S face as we hear... THE BOOMING SOUND OF METAL       EVELYN pinned against the wall... THE CREATURE's mouth open!     When suddenly...     The CREATURE immediately turns its head... Toward the sound     of the SILO.       THE LOUD SOUND OF GROANING METAL ECHOES across the sky above      He immediately jumps on top of the tractor.   WE FOLLOW as:      THE SILO. Then...      LEE slowly turns only his head as we hear... a low, growling     hum... almost like that of a swarm of bees.     WE TRAVEL AROUND LEE 180 degrees and follow his gaze now     toward the FARMHOUSE and BARN... and...      1 line... no 2... no... 4!!!     THE SOUND GROWS LOUDER AND LOUDER as WE TILT with these     rushing lines... HEADING STRAIGHT FOR LEE.     ON LEE'S face as he looks on in horror at this unstoppable     reality, as the lines... and the SHADOWS causing them...      WE MOVE BACK AROUND LEE as he spins around to watch the lines     head directly for...      REGAN runs to the edge of the hole to see... Two giant trap     doors of the silo roof swinging... GROANING BACK AND FORTH!!!     Many feet below, we see MARCUS... waist deep in a mountain...      REGAN'S body quakes as she does everything she can to resist     the urge to call out when suddenly... MARCUS MOVES!     MARCUS looks up at his sister as he wiggles and squirms,     desperately trying to get free. But with every movement      REGAN signs to her brother to stop moving!!   When suddenly...      ON REGAN as she places her hands on the SILO metal... as it     now vibrates with each blow!     Then... A SCREEEEEEEEEEEEECH!!!!      MARCUS now thrashes wildly from fear!... AS HE SINKS EVEN      ON REGAN as she tries to sign to her brother frantically when     suddenly...      As the steel door crashes into the corn like a guillotine     only inches away from him, MARCUS lunges out of the way!!!...     That desperate quick movement... causes the corn to give way     even more... as it now engulfs MARCUS up to his chest!!!     Suddenly....A CRACK OF LIGHT PIERCES THROUGH THE SILO      ON REGAN as she tries to process it all and then finally...       REGAN lands feet first into the packed corn... which     immediately engulfs her to her waist!!! She begins to     scramble toward her brother... SHE TOO SINKING FURTHER INTO      REGAN begins to push the fallen steel door toward her     brother.     ON MARCUS as he desperately reaches his hand out toward the     door... his face beginning to sink under the corn!!!     REGAN makes one last desperate push of the door toward her     brother's hand... AS CORN ENGULFS HER TO HER CHEST!!!     In one swift move, MARCUS places his hand onto the fallen     silo door that sits atop the corn like a floating log in a     river.     MARCUS's hand grabs hold of the steel and begins to pull     himself out. As he gets his arm up on the steel door, he     turns back and reaches for his sister... WHO IS NOW ENGULFED      MARCUS immediately reaches back to grab her hand... but REGAN     shakes her head and motions for him to stop! Then... she     takes one last deep breath as...        A whirring of dense sound, like that of heavy rain on a car     roof. Trickles of fading light as the sound grows quieter...     and quieter and then... is gone.      MARCUS ferociously claws at the grain where his sister once     was when suddenly...      MARCUS looks back across the mountain and sees that the corn      CREATURES!!!! And as the corn pours out the side, the corn     MARCUS sits atop... BEGINS TO GIVE WAY AND SLIDE TOWARD THE        Faintly... The whirring sounds slowly begin to fade back in.     And with it a muted...     ...boom....boom!...     Tiny shafts of light begin to poke through our dark world as     the sound grows...     ...Boom!.....BOOM!... Suddenly...       The cascading corn... is actually sliding away at such a     fierce rate that it unearths...     REGAN'S FACE AS IT POPS OUT FROM THE CORN!!! REGAN takes     in... the deepest breath of air her lungs can handle.      LOW ON a sand path cutting through thick cornfields on either     side as... LEE rounds the corner and sprints as fast as he     can, his flashlight thrashes through the night sky.      ON MARCUS as he wraps his arm around his sister and pulls her     up to the steel door.     ON REGAN, sweating... breathing heavily... She looks to     MARCUS... who is looking away??     MARCUS puts his finger to his mouth to tell his sister to be     quiet.     Now with MARCUS, we suddenly realize... THE BANGING HAS      MARCUS grabs his flashlight and shines it down toward the     hole created by the creatures... NOTHING!     MARCUS shines the flashlight to another set of slash marks on     the silo wall... NOTHING! MARCUS shines the flashlight across the now still corn... Then suddenly... A SQUEAK!!!!MARCUS' flashlight launches up to the roof of the silo...where the second of the two doors squeaks back and forth.MARCUS' flashlight looks all around the trap door... Allaround the roof... NOTHING!!!As MARCUS leads the light back down the silo wall, he brieflyilluminates REGAN, when suddenly... REGAN looks up to the creature in horror and then whipsaround... and tackles MARCUS off the door!!! REGAN grabs the edge of the door and lifts it over her andMARCUS' heads!PINNED UNDERNEATH THE SILO DOOR, MARCUS looks over to hissister to see... SHE IS HOLDING HER EAR... NEARLY CONVULSINGWITH PAIN!!!   Not knowing what is happening to her he slowlyreaches out his hand to her when suddenly... The children stare at the claw, horrified when suddenly... After a long moment of seizing up... THE CLAW RIPS BACK  Then... the sounds of SLASHING METAL!!! WE BARELY SEE THE Suddenly, a HORRIFYING RIPPING SOUND!!! And then...        The children look at each other.... silent... waiting.      After a long moment, REGAN and MARCUS begin to slide the silo      door off of them... and peak out.      MARCUS picks up the flashlight and shines the light all      around the silo... then suddenly stops... The children just      stare... AS WE SLOWLY PULL BACK TO REVEAL...       MARCUS looks back to his sister... breathing heavily... WHAT        WE GO WIDE to REGAN and MARCUS jumping down from the same      large hole... onto a large pile of corn that has spilt out      into the night... THEY ARE COMPLETELY ALONE.      MARCUS suddenly grabs REGAN'S hand and pulls her to her feet.      ON THE BACKS OF THE KIDS as they sprint through the farm      equipment graveyard holding hands...      Suddenly, REGAN turns to head into the cornfields... MARCUS      yanks her arm to stop her.      REGAN looks at her brother... The look in his eye is begging      her to trust him... she does as MARCUS pulls her to his safe      place... the PICK UP TRUCK at the end of the driveway!      As they arrive at the truck MARCUS expertly disappears      through the cab's driver's side window... REGAN instinctively      dives underneath the truck.      WE SLOWLY PULL BACK on the truck. MARCUS' head pokes up from      the back window of the cab. REGAN lies still underneath.      They are split up... but safe.       WE MOVE along a sand path, just as we did in the beginning of      the movie, where the end of the cornfield opens into a      clearing to reveal... THE WORK TRUCK off to the far left.      LEE appears into frame.      ON LEE as he shines the flashlight... scanning the scene. HIS POV as it is... eerily quiet. LEE's flashlight shinesall the way to the far right onto the gaping hole in theSILO... BUT THERE ARE NO CREATURES. Just the cement mixerand some tools tipped onto the ground.      Fearing the worst... LEE makes his way to the hole.     ON REGAN as she lifts her head to see the light shining on     the SILO... and her father walking toward it. Her eyes go     wide. She begins to shake her head... then wave her arms as     best she can... no... no... NO!... but LEE doesn't see her.     LEE begins to walk slowly toward the SILO.      WE ARE OVER THE STAIRS looking through the basement to the     monitors.     Suddenly... A dripping wet foot steps into frame... and then     another as...     EVELYN descends the stairs, holding the baby!      Through the rearview mirror we see reflections of LEE's     flashlight as it scans up and down the SILO behind.     ON MARCUS as the dim light reflects onto his closed eyes...     and he wakes up. In the rearview he sees the flashlight and     immediately spins to look out the window at his father...     standing only yards from the hole. The smallest whisper...                ...Dad... no... NO....     Overcome with fear, MARCUS instinctively slides to the driver     side door... AND OPENS IT!!!!      As the driver's side door wrenches open, the age of the truck     and the years without use become painfully evident as...       Almost transported back to that fateful day on the bridge, we     watch as LEE's head slowly turns as he raises his light onto     the truck and... his son!!     Then, just as he did on the bridge... knowing what comes     next... LEE RUNS!!!        REGAN rolls out from under the car, grabs her brother and      safely tackles him into the car, closing the door behind      them.       REGAN puts her brother down onto the floor of the truck      underneath the steering wheel for protection... and then hops      over to the passenger side, sits up... and looks out the back      window.       ON LEE... running.      ... Desperately trying to keep his promise to his wife...       OVER REGAN, as she watches her father sprinting towards      them...      When suddenly behind him... TWO SHADOWS!!!       OVER LEE as he sprints as fast as he can towards the truck,      now only 40 yards away...30...      THEN... on either side of LEE...       Still in full sprint, LEE watches...        OVER REGAN looking out the back window as the creature gets      closer...closer...      THE BEEEEEEEP ONCE AGAIN BEGINS TO GROW... and GROW. Just as      the creature is about to make impact... REGAN, not wanting to      experience that pain again... TURNS THE HEARING AID OFF....      We are now in total silence.....       REGAN looks down at her brother on the floor... Just as....       The kids grab onto... whatever they can...        Now outside REGAN's perspective... and in LEE's... we can      hear the full sound of the violent attack!         FROM UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK we see the front wheels slide      forward in the sand.       The front wheels slide again. This time... they begin to      disappear over the edge of the clearing... and down the long      driveway...        ON REGAN AND MARCUS as she holds her brother and looks around      the cab for options. Suddenly, out the passenger side window      she sees...       GLASS SHATTERS!!!... And the truck... LIFTS UP!!!       ON LEE'S BACK, SPRINTING, now only twenty yards away... when      he sees the right side of the truck lift high into the air.      For a moment it looks as though it is going to tip all the      way over... Then SMASHES BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND!!      We now bear witness to something eerily familiar as LEE's       WE CIRCLE around LEE as HIS FEET SCRAPE TO A STOP... HIS       WE END OUR MOVE on LEE's face as he scans the smashed      truck...      His eyes seem to actually flicker as his brain fires and      misfires... trying to process this nightmare... this LOSS...      When suddenly...       ON REGAN, jammed down into the floor of the passenger seat.      She reaches over to her brother... and lifts his head. MARCUS      opens his teary eyes, shaken... but alive. REGAN slowly      rises up onto the seat... And through the smashed window...        WE ARE CLOSE ON LEE as he registers this miraculous sight of      his daughter and watch...       LEE breathes heavily... taking in this new information...      this second chance... then...      LEE slowly brings his hands to his chest...                  ... I love you.       As REGAN looks out at her father, confused... moved... Why      did he just say that?...when suddenly...       crushing it from the weight...       ON LEE... as he signs to REGAN again...                      I have... always... loved you.        ON REGAN... as tears stream down her face...       Above her... the roof begins to cave in from the weight of       the creature!!!!        ON LEE as he watches the CREATURE make his way up to the roof       of the truck... AND REAR BACK...              Time seems to slow almost to a stop as:       MARCUS' eyes shoot open... knowing exactly what his dad is       doing...       The CREATURES scramble off the truck... AND IMMEDIATELY       REGAN scrambles in the seat helplessly as she looks out at      her father mid scream...      MARCUS looks up to his sister in the truest of pain...      And then down...      CLOSE ON... THE EMERGENCY BRAKE as...        OVER LEE as the CREATURES SPRINTS TOWARD HIM... CLOSER...       IN THE BACKGROUND, the truck begins to roll down the hill.       THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW our frame begins to jiggle as we see      the CREATURES close in on LEE...      WE WATCH as REGAN scrambles up the seat higher and higher      desperate to see her father one last time... and then...      As the truck rolls down... OUR FRAME TILTS UP... AWAY FROM          OVER REGAN ONTO MARCUS as they both stare straight...      Their faces vacant as they rattle and bounce as the truck      barrels down the long driveway toward the barn.      Instinctively, MARCUS' hands raise into frame... and grab the      wheel...      He is finally driving... as he begins to cry.        CLOSE ON MONITORS... As EVELYN's face comes into frame...      OVER HER SHOULDER TO THE MONITOR we see she is looking at...        CLOSE ON LEE's shotgun laying on the floor. Suddenly...      EVELYN's hand comes into frame and grabs it!       THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW, WE LOOK OUT onto the      cornfields... and up to the silo. Suddenly... We see a tiny      pick up truck appear and rumble down the dirt road.      WE SLOWLY PULL BACK through the living room as the truck      rolls past the next window... and then the next. AS WE NOW      PULL OUT of the living room and into the front hall,      suddenly... EVELYN appears walking down the staircase, almost      vacant. She is carrying the shotgun!      WE CONTINUE TO MOVE, NOW ON EVELYN'S BACK... as she slowly      walks out the front door and down the front steps. As she      steps down to the sand path... THE PICK UP TRUCK SLOWLY       MARCUS AND REGAN pop out of the truck and run as fast as they      can into their mother's arms!!!       moment she wasn't sure she would ever get again!... then...      ON EVELYN's face as she slowly turns her head back toward the      silo... TO SEE WHAT'S COMING...       WE LOOK DIRECTLY up the basement stairs toward the warm      hallway at the top.      Suddenly... EVELYN steps into frame carrying MARCUS, and      rushes down the stairs and into the basement.      Then... REGAN takes a long step into frame.   Her silhouette      looks down the dark stairwell. After a moment, she slowly puts her foot down on the firststep... and nothing happens.For a brief moment... she looks behind her... but no onecomes.        WE ARE ON THE STAIRS as REGAN's feet step down into frame.      As REGAN reaches the basement floor, she pauses a moment,      still looking at her feet... and then slowly turns.      EVELYN picks the baby out from a box and grabs MARCUS tight.      We watch REGAN's face as she enters her father's workspace...      FOR THE FIRST TIME!!! She is stunned.      OVER REGAN as she steps down and begins to walk through the      room. Her eyes track, AS WE DID WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE ROOM,      past the TOWERING WALL OF SECURITY MONITORS... along the wall      of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, NOTES, AND SCIENTIFIC IMAGES. Her      eyes continue now toward her father's WORK STATION. THROUGH      BOXES OF SALVAGED ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT and onto... LEE'S HEAD      PHONES. REGAN picks up the head phones and follows the      wire... TO HER FATHER'S HAM RADIO. She looks down at the      knob her father used to search... and the microphone he used      to reach out. For the first time REGAN sees... REGAN      REALIZES... THIS is what her father was doing all this time.      THIS is what he was doing... FOR THEM! ON REGAN taking all      this in, when her eyes move just slightly to the side... and      she freezes.      EVELYN immediately turns and gestures to her children to      follow her behind the water heater... they must hide.      REGAN... doesn't move. OFF HER FACE... WE BOOM DOWN SLOWLY      BEHIND the shelves of LEE'S sacred workspace... past circuit      boards... salvaged electronics and exposed wiring... and LAND      ON A SHOT DIRECTLY ACROSS LEE'S DESK... TO REGAN's HAND...      AS REGAN reaches out, WE RACK FOCUS to... THE PILE OF HEARING       REGAN'S hand pushes into the pile like a shovel... and      emerges with a handful of hearing aids...      Suddenly... THE FLOORBOARDS ABOVE THEM CREAK!!!      MARCUS and EVELYN look up.   REGAN... does not... Because she      can't hear it.      EVELYN immediately grabs MARCUS and heads for the water and      oil tanks. She sits MARCUS down safely... and then places      THE BABY IN HIS ARMS... and turns.      MARCUS takes in his new sibling for the first time.      OVER REGAN, COMING INTO FOCUS... is EVELYN, still carrying      the shotgun. She kneels by her daughter's side.            We have to hide, my love.REGAN slowly turns to her mother... and shows her the hearingaids.EVELYN looks down at her daughter who for the first time...is weeping... our tough warrior princess, in this moment...is still just a little girl.EVELYN stares into the pained eyes of her little girl whensuddenly... REGAN's eyes begin to rise... higher... andhigher above EVELYN.  EVELYN seeing REGAN's eyes rise... just knows.In one swift motion EVELYN suddenly springs up... and aimsthe shotgun directly at the CREATURE.WE CUT WIDE to see... and hear, the room... is totally still.For the rest of this scene...Like the greatest of westerns,we are in the most epic... of standoffs. Time... standsstill. Air... doesn't move. Tension... is dripping from thewalls.ON REGAN... holding her breath... just staresON MARCUS... frozen behind the water tank... just stares.ON EVELYN... arm outstretched, with weapon ready... juststares. As the monitors once again... go fuzzy.... Each of the humanscan only watch as these small plates open with the suction ofanatomical goo...They can only watch as the plates crackle ever so slightly...as they turn... and search......for the sound that will end it all.CLOSE on sweat dripping down from MARCUS's forehead. TRACKINGDOWN MARCUS' face, we see the inevitable path his sweat willtake until we leave his face and arrive on... The baby.CLOSE ON EVELYN's arm... as it begins to quiver... CLOSE ON EVELYN'S eyes as her brain makes the realization...she can't hold this gun much longer...CLOSE ON THE CREATURE... as it opens more... and more plates!CLOSE ON REGAN, her eyes begin to search the room... herfather's room looking for something... ANYTHING!REGAN's POV as her eyes search the room... search the wall...search the boards. Finally her eyes land on one specificthing on her father's board... She sees the phrase... Suddenly...REGAN... reaches up to touch her mother's arm.EVELYN looks down at REGAN...REGAN gently shakes her head then gently touches EVELYN'sarm... and slowly lowers the gun.EVELYN looks down at her daughter... her eyes begin to wellup... this is it... This is the end.EVELYN slowly reaches out to take REGAN's hand.   As REGAN'shand begins to clasp into hers... SHE STOPS...EVELYN looks down to see REGAN slowly pull her hand away...and open it up. There in the palm of REGAN's hand... arehearing aids.REGAN slowly turns to her father's work bench to see the pileof hearing aids her father... made... sitting just in frontof the microphone of the HAM RADIO.REGAN looks back up to the board at the phrase... REGAN looks to the creature still searching the room forsound.REGAN raises her hand to her ear... AND TURNS HER FATHER'S Immediately.... THE EXCRUCIATING BEEEEEEEP FLOODS OUR WORLD!Suddenly THE CREATURE... STOPS!   IT'S PLATES... SNAP SHUT OUT REGAN looks on as the CREATURE SCRAMBLES BACK IN OBVIOUS After a moment REGAN... SWITCHES THE HEARING AID OFF! EVELYN looks down at her daughter...REGAN... slowly moves her hand across her father's workbenchto... THE HEADPHONES.THE CREATURE... NOW SCREEEEEEEEEEEECHES!!!!... slowly getsback to it's feet ... AND TURNS DIRECTLY TOWARD REGAN!!!REGAN's fingers travel up the black cord of her father'sheadphones to... THE HAM RADIO! Suddenly REGAN unplugs theheadphones from the HAM RADIO as we hear... A POP OF FEEDBACK  Just then...WE ARE ON MARCUS who's sweat has indeed made it to hischin... THEN FALLS.    - REGAN reaches her hand up to her ear... AND REMOVES THE  And in that exact moment, REGAN... EXTENDS HER ARM...  CLOSE on the HAM RADIO SPEAKER.... With the sound now HUGELY more powerful and piercing we see:THE CREATURE suddenly...SHOOTS UP DEAD STRAIGHT... ONCE AGAIN ON REGAN as her face... DOESN'T CHANGE... SHE IS SAFE NOW  SKIN. And then... THEY BEGIN TO SHAKE! The plates... SHAKE MORE VIOLENTLY NOW... and that creates asound. Something between that of a cicada right next to yourear... and the sound of a house fan's blade rubbing againstthe cage its enclosed in, the sound... IS AWFUL!Just then... A POPPING SOUND. And then another... as thefrequency of the sound short circuits the plates to the pointthat they... BEGIN TO POP OPEN... AND THEN GIVE WAY!!!As plates now begin to go limp, for the first time... WE SEE     The only sound that can be heard is the CREATURE'S inneranatomy as it rises and slowly falls... as if gasping forlife...EVELYN and REGAN look over to the water tanks... AS MARCUS EVELYN takes one step toward him when...   When suddenly...  ...Silence...REGAN and EVELYN look to the CARCUS at they're feet.... After a long moment... from outside, off in the distance...we hear a muffled... SCREEEEEEECH.And then... ANOTHER... AND ANOTHER... The other creatures.... REGAN and EVELYN slowly look to the monitors... as theirimages once again flicker to life. On each of themonitors... a quiet, undisturbed landscape....Then suddenly in one of the monitors off in the leftcorner... A CLAW STEPS INTO FRAME!!!!In another monitor... A SHADOW FLASHES PAST THE SCREEN.Then another monitor... ANOTHER CREATURE... AND ANOTHER... EVELYN slowly turns... and looks down at her daughter.REGAN looks up at her mother for a long moment and thenreaches out her hand to the knob of the HAM RADIO.......... EVELYN's face... changes... as she raises the shot gun intoframe........
